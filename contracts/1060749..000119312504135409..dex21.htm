(d) all Tax sharing agreements between Knight, Holdings or any of their
Affiliates (other than the Sellers), on the one hand, and either or both of
the Sellers on the other hand;



(e) all Records of Sellers to the extent they are used in or intended for
use in the Business or relating to the Acquired Assets;



(f) such licenses, Permits or other certificates of authority which, by their
terms, are nonassignable; and



(g) [intentionally omitted]



(h) the asset listed on _Schedule 2.2(h)_.



For the sake of clarity, all references herein to Acquired Assets shall be
deemed not to include the Excluded Assets.



2.3 _Assumption of Liabilities_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Parent or Purchasers shall
assume, and shall become obligated to pay, perform and discharge when due (i)
all Liabilities, other than the Retained Liabilities, of the Sellers reflected
on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet, (ii) all Liabilities and obligations

responsibility of Parent under _Section 9.2_ ) which arise on and after the
Closing Date and relate to the Acquired Assets and the operation of the
Business by Parent or Purchaser, (iii) all Liabilities and obligations of
Parent or Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.8_ hereof, and (iv) all Liabilities
arising out of or relating to the Assigned Contracts (collectively, the "
_Assumed Liabilities_ ").



2.4 _Retained Liabilities_. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this
Agreement, including _Section 2.3_ , and regardless of any disclosure made to
Parent or Purchasers, Parent and Purchasers shall not assume any Liabilities
other than the Assumed Liabilities (all Liabilities that are not Assumed
Liabilities, collectively, the " _Retained Liabilities_ "), including without
limitation:



(a) all Liabilities of the Sellers as of the Closing Date not reflected on the
Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and not otherwise addressed by any of the
following clauses of this _Section 2.4_ ;



(b) all Liabilities to the extent relating to shares of Class A ISE Stock;



(c) all Liabilities resulting from any matter set forth on _Schedule 2.4(c)_ ;

2.5 _Purchase Price_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Parent
an estimated combined balance sheet of the Business as of the Closing prepared
(a) in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with that used in
preparation of the Combined Financial Statements (including the
accounting policies set forth in the historical financial statements of
Knight for 2003) and (b) in a manner consistent with the illustrative balance
sheet set forth on _Schedule 2.5_ (the " _Benchmark Balance Sheet_ "), and
showing the estimated Book Value (as defined below) of the Business (the "
_Benchmark Book Value_ ") derived therefrom. The term " _Book Value_ " shall
mean the difference between (x) the Acquired Assets shown on the relevant
balance sheet _minus_ (y) the Assumed Liabilities shown on the relevant
balance sheet. Purchaser agrees to pay to Sellers at the Closing, an amount
equal to (i) the Base Price _plus_ (ii) the Benchmark Book Value
(collectively, the " _Purchase Price_ ").



2.6 _Closing_. 



(a) The closing of the transactions provided for in this Agreement (the "
_Closing_ ") shall be held, subject to _Section 2.6(b)_ , at 9:30 a.m. at the
offices of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen and Hamilton, One Liberty Plaza, New York,
New York, (x) on the second Business Day after each of the conditions set
forth in _Article 6_ of this Agreement (other than those conditions to be
satisfied at the Closing) shall have been fulfilled or waived in accordance
herewith or (y) at such other time and date as the Parties may agree
in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to
as the " _Closing Date_ ". All proceedings to be taken and all documents to be
executed and delivered by all Parties at the Closing shall be deemed to have
been taken and executed simultaneously, and no proceedings shall be deemed
taken nor any documents executed or delivered until all have been taken,
executed and delivered.



(b) Notwithstanding _Section 2.6(a)(x)_ , if consent or approval of (x) the
assignment to Parent or Purchasers of any Contract listed on _Schedule 2.6_ ,
(y) the approval of the SEC of the registration of Parent or a Purchaser as a
new broker-dealer or (z) the approval of the Chicago Board Options Exchange of
Parent or a Purchaser to become a member thereof, in each case is not
obtained prior to the time at which Closing would otherwise occur pursuant to
_Section 2.6(a)(x)_ (such time, the " _Interim Date_ "), then upon written
notice by Parent to Holdings and Sellers that it is exercising its right to
delay the Closing pursuant to this _Section 2.6(b)_ , the Closing shall be
held on the earlier of (A) the second Business Day after either (i) each such
consent or approval shall have been obtained or (ii) the Sellers have
identified and entered into an Alternative Arrangement with respect to each
such item for which consent or approval has not been obtained, or (B) the day
that is 90 days after the day on which the Closing otherwise would have
occurred pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)(x)_ unless such day is not a Business
Day, in which case the next succeeding Business Day shall apply for purposes
of this clause (B) (the earlier of such dates, the " _Final Closing Date_ ");
_provided_ , that in the event the Closing is delayed pursuant to this
_Section 2.6(b)_ , the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.2(b)_ and _6.2(e)_
shall be deemed to have been satisfied on the Final Closing Date so long as
(1) such conditions would have been satisfied on the Interim Date and (2)
with respect to the condition set forth in _Sections 6.2(b)_ , such condition
would not otherwise fail to have been satisfied on the Final Closing Date due
to intentional action or inaction taken by Holdings or Sellers, respectively,
which intentional action  



 

13  or inaction Holdings or Sellers, as the case may be, knows would otherwise
cause such condition to fail to be satisfied.



2.7 _Closing Deliveries_.



(a) At the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause Purchasers to, deliver
to Sellers:



(i) the Purchase Price, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the accounts designated by Sellers at least three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date;



(ii) an executed counterpart of each Transaction Document; and



(iii) all certificates, documents and instruments required pursuant to
_Section 6.1_.



(b) At the Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Parent or Purchasers, as
the case may be:



(i) an executed counterpart of each Transaction Document;



(ii) copies of Records as requested pursuant to _Section 5.6(b)_ ; and



(iii) all certificates, documents and instruments required pursuant to
_Section 6.2_.



2.8 _Post-Closing Adjustment of the Purchase Price_.



(a) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date (but in no event
later than 90 days following the Closing Date), Parent shall deliver to
Sellers a combined balance sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date,
including a determination of Book Value (as defined above) (the " _Preliminary
Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "). The Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet
shall be prepared (i) in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent
with that used in the preparation of the Combined Financial Statements
(including the accounting policies set forth in the historical financial
statements of Knight for 2003) and (ii) in a manner consistent with the
illustrative balance sheet set forth on _Schedule 2.5_.



(b) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Preliminary Closing Date
Balance Sheet, Sellers shall notify Parent, in reasonable detail, of
any objections to the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet. If Sellers have
not given any such notice to Parent within such thirty (30) day period, then
the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be deemed to be the final
balance sheet of the Business (the " _Final Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "),
as of the Closing Date for purposes of this _Section 2.8_. If Sellers notify
Parent of any such objections by the end of that thirty (30) day period,
Sellers shall in the notice of such dispute set forth, in reasonable detail,
those items that they believe are not fairly presented or calculated and the
reasons for its opinion. Parent and Sellers shall then meet and in good faith
try to resolve their disagreements over the disputed items. If the Parties
resolve their disagreements in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the
Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, with those modifications, if any, to
which the Parties shall have agreed shall be deemed to be the Final Closing
Date Balance Sheet. If the Parties have not resolved their disagreements over
the  



 

14  disputed items within thirty (30) days after Sellers notice of dispute, the
Parties shall forthwith jointly submit those disputed items to
Deloitte Touche Tomatsu or such other accounting firm as may be agreed in
good faith by Parent and Sellers (Deloitte Touche Tomatsu or such other
accounting firm so selected, the " _Accounting Referee_ "), which shall be
selected as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 10 days
following the expiration of such 30-day period. If Parent and Sellers cannot
agree on the selection of the Accounting Referee with the 10-day period, then
Parent and Sellers shall request the American Arbitration Association, New
York office, to appoint the Accounting Referee. Each Party agrees to execute,
if requested by the Accounting Referee, a reasonable engagement letter,
including customary indemnities. The Accounting Referee shall act as an
arbitrator to determine, based solely on the provisions of this _Section
2.8(b)_ and the presentations by Parent and Sellers, and not by independent
review, only those issues still in dispute. The Accounting Referee shall have
up to 30 days after its appointment to resolve any disputes that are
submitted to such Accounting Referee. The Accounting Referee, within twenty
(20) days after such submission or such other period as the Accounting Referee
may reasonably require, shall make a binding determination of those disputed
items in accordance with this Agreement and the Preliminary Closing Date
Balance Sheet, with those modifications determined by the Accounting Referee
to be appropriate, which shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Date Balance
Sheet. The determination of the Accounting Referee shall not, in the absence
of manifest error, be subject to contest. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Referee shall be shared equally by Sellers, on the one hand,
and Parent and Purchasers, on the other hand.



(c) If the Book Value of the Business as reflected on the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet (the " _Final Book Value_ ") is greater than the Benchmark Book
Value then, the Purchase Price shall be increased, dollar for dollar, by the
amount by which the Final Book Value is greater than the Benchmark Book
Value, with Parent paying or causing Purchasers to pay to Sellers an amount of
cash equal to such amount. If the Final Book Value is less than the Benchmark
Book Value, then the Purchase Price shall be decreased, dollar for dollar, by
the amount by which the Final Book Value is less than the Benchmark Book
Value, with Sellers paying to Parent (or if designated by Parent, Purchasers)
an amount of cash equal to such amount (such amount of increase or decrease,
if any, to the Purchase Price shall be referred to herein as the " _Purchase
Price Adjustment_ "). The Purchase Price Adjustment, if any, shall be paid (by
wire transfer or other immediately available funds) within five (5) Business
Days after the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet is finalized, in accordance
with this _Section 2.8_ by the Party whose obligation it is to make such
payment.



2.9 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and Purchasers shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold Taxes from the Purchase Price and the Purchase Price
Adjustment payable pursuant to _Section 2.8_ as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of a Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or Purchasers, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to Sellers in respect to which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent or the Purchasers as the case may be.



2.10 _Tax Treatment_. Parent, Purchasers and Sellers shall cooperate in good
faith to reasonably allocate the Purchase Price (as it may be adjusted
pursuant to _Section 2.8_ above) plus  



 

15  the Assumed Liabilities in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Allocation Agreement_ ").
In this regard, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
Parent, Purchasers and Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to
estimate the allocation of the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities among
the Acquired Assets. Further, Parent and Purchasers shall initially prepare
and deliver to Sellers a draft of the Allocation Agreement among the Acquired
Assets (the " _Proposed Allocation_ ") (which Proposed Allocation shall be
reasonably consistent with the allocation described in the preceding
sentence) and shall submit such Proposed Allocation to Sellers within 90 days
after the Closing. If, within 60 days after Sellers receipt of the Proposed
Allocation, Sellers shall not have objected in writing to such Proposed
Allocation, the Proposed Allocation shall become the Allocation Agreement. In
the event that Sellers object in writing within such 60-day period and Parent,
Purchasers and Sellers are unable in good faith to reach an agreement, each
of the Parties may prepare and file its Tax Returns and take any position it
sees fit. Each Party shall file all federal, state and other Tax Returns and
information reporting forms required to be filed in accordance with any
Allocation Agreement agreed upon. Except as otherwise required by law, no
Party shall take an inconsistent position with the Allocation Agreement agreed
upon on any Tax Return or otherwise. The Parties agree to consult with one
another with respect to any Tax Audit, controversy or litigation relating to
the allocation made pursuant to this _Section 2.10_ by the IRS or another
taxing authority.

(within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA), (ii) a "multiple
employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code) or (iii) a

or service other than coverage mandated by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or
Section 4980B of the Code or state Law.



(h) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.8(h)_ , neither the execution and

payment from the Sellers; (ii) increase the amount of compensation or

former employee, consultant, officer or director to either of the Sellers.



(k) There are no material Liabilities of either of the Sellers relating to

fide third party insurance carrier.



 

20 (l) With respect to Company Benefit Plans and with respect to each state
workers compensation arrangement that is funded wholly or partially through
an insurance policy or public or private fund, all premiums required to have
been paid under the insurance policy or fund through the Closing Date, to the
extent either of the Sellers has any responsibility therefore, will have been
paid on or before the Closing Date except to the extent that would not result
in any material Liability to either of the Sellers and, as of the Closing
Date, there will be no material Liability of either of the Sellers under any
such insurance policy, fund or ancillary agreement with respect to such
insurance policy in the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing
arrangement or other actual or contingent material liability arising
wholly or partially out of events occurring prior to the Closing Date.



(m) Other than with respect to the Company Benefit Plans, no transaction has

conditions set forth in _Section 6_ hereof as promptly as practicable.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Parties will (i)
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten (10) days of the date
hereof with respect to the HSR Act) file (A) any Notification and Report
Forms and related material that it may be required to file with the Federal
Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the United States

Governmental Authorities as soon as practicable, including, without
limitation, in the case of Parent and Purchasers, effecting the sale
or disposition of, divestiture, or arranging to hold separate assets or
businesses, or making any necessary undertaking, agreement, covenant or
condition (effecting such a sale, disposition, divestiture or hold separate
arrangement, entering into any such undertaking, agreement, covenant or
condition or taking any other action to obtain such required approvals, an "
_Accommodation_ "), to the extent necessary or required to obtain any such
expiration, termination or approval from any such Governmental Authority;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Purchasers shall not be required to
make any Accommodation that would, after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (i) have a material adverse effect on the
business, financial condition, assets or operations of the Business or
Acquired Assets, taken as a whole, (ii) with respect to obtaining the
termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, deprive Parent
and Purchasers of a material portion of the economic benefits which they
reasonably expected to obtain from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (iii) with respect to obtaining any other expiration,
termination or approval from a Governmental Authority, either (A) deprive
Parent and Purchasers of a significant portion (which portion need not be
material) of the economic benefits (including operational synergies) which
they reasonably expected to obtain from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (B) constitute an action that is not in all material respects
substantially the same as actions required by the applicable Governmental
Authority of other broker-dealers for such other broker-dealers to
obtain substantially the same termination, expiration or approval in the face
of circumstances that are substantially similar to those circumstances in
question in light of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
involving a broker-dealer with capitalization equal to or greater than that
of KFP as of the date hereof. Further, Holdings and Sellers, on the one hand,
and Parent and Purchasers, on the other hand, shall, in connection with
matters under or relating to the HSR Act and, with respect to any other
matters solely to the extent they relate to a proposed Accommodation, to the
extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Authority and where reasonably
practicable: (i) provide the other Parties reasonable prior notice of
any substantive communication with, and any proposed understanding,
undertaking, or agreement with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such
filings or any such information; and (ii) provide the other Parties the
opportunity to attend and/or participate in any meeting or substantive
conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings,
investigation, or other inquiry. The Parties will consult and cooperate with
one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments,  



 

35  opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party hereto
in connection with matters under or relating to the HSR Act or any other
matters solely to the extent they relate to a proposed Accommodation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Purchasers shall not be required, in
connection with matters under or relating to the HSR Act or matters relating
to a proposed Accommodation, to provide Holdings or Sellers with the
opportunity to attend and/or participate in any such meeting or conversation
or to consult and cooperate on any such materials to be made or submitted by
Parent and Purchasers if such attendance, participation, consultation or
cooperation would (i) result in confidential information of Parent and
Purchasers being divulged to Holdings or Sellers (in which case Parent and
Purchasers shall provide Holdings and Sellers outside counsel (which
shall not be more than one outside counsel) with the opportunity to attend
and/or participate in such meeting or conversation or to consult and cooperate
on such materials, as the case may be, so long as such counsel agrees with
Parent not to, and Holdings and Sellers ensure that such outside counsel does
not, disclose any such confidential information to Holdings, Sellers or their
other Representatives), (ii) jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or (iii)
contravene any applicable Law. 



5.2 _Alternative Transactions_. From and after the date hereof, Holdings,
Knight and Sellers shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective
Affiliates to, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a)(i) solicit
or encourage any inquiries, discussions or proposals regarding, (ii)
continue, propose or enter into negotiations with respect to, or (iii) enter
into any Contract providing for, or consummate, any Alternative Transaction or
(b) provide any information to any other Person for the purpose of making,
evaluating or determining whether to make or pursue any inquiries or proposals
with respect to any Alternative Transaction. Holdings, Knight and Sellers
shall reasonably promptly advise Parent of (i) any written or oral formal
proposal regarding an Alternative Transaction and the identity of the Persons
making any such written or oral formal proposal that any of Holdings, Knight,
the Sellers or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives may receive and (ii) with respect to any such
written formal proposal that relates solely to the Business or Acquired Assets
and not to any other businesses of Knight or its other Affiliates, the terms
of such proposal (so long as the disclosure of such terms is not prohibited
by a binding agreement to which Knight or any of its Affiliates is a party as
of the date hereof).



5.3 _Access to Information Prior to Closing_. From and after the date hereof
and until the Closing, Holdings shall cause each Seller to, and each Seller
shall, (i) afford Parent and Purchasers and their authorized Representatives
reasonable access (during regular business hours upon reasonable advance
notice) to all employees, offices and other facilities and to all books and
records (including Tax Returns, pro forma schedules or workpapers relating
exclusively to the Business or the Acquired Assets or the income or operations
of the Business) of the Business or directly relating to the Acquired Assets
and shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Sellers
independent public accountants to provide access to their work papers and such
other information, in each case relating to the Sellers, as Parent or
Purchasers may reasonably request (subject to Parent and Purchasers executing
such customary agreements with respect thereto as may be reasonably requested
by such accountants); (ii) permit Parent and Purchasers and their authorized
Representatives to make such copies and inspections thereof, upon reasonable
advance notice and during regular business hours, as they may reasonably
request; and (iii) cause the officers of each Seller to furnish Parent and
Purchasers with such  



 

36  financial and operating data and other information with respect to the
Business, Acquired Assets and personnel of the Business as is regularly
prepared in the ordinary course of business that Parent and Purchasers may
from time to time reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
access shall be conducted at Parent and Purchasers sole expense, at a
reasonable time, under the supervision of the respective Sellers personnel
and in such a manner as to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and not to interfere with the normal
operations of the business of the Sellers. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this or any other agreement between Parent or its Affiliates on the one
hand and Sellers or its Affiliates on the other hand executed prior to the
date hereof, (i) none of Holdings, the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any obligation to make available to Parent, Purchasers
or their Representatives, or provide Parent, Purchasers or their
Representatives with, any consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return filed
by Holdings, the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or
predecessors, or any related material, except as specifically described above
in this _Section 5.3_ ; and (ii) nothing herein shall require either Holdings
or the Sellers to disclose any information to Parent or Purchasers if such
disclosure would in Holdings sole and absolute reasonable discretion (A)
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or (B) contravene any applicable Law
or binding agreement (including any confidentiality agreement to which
Holdings, the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates is a party,
_provided_ , _however_ , that Holdings shall use commercially reasonable best
efforts (which, for the sake of clarity, shall not include paying any amounts
other than de minimis amounts) to obtain any consents of the counter-party to
any such binding agreement necessary to disclose such information).



5.4 _Commercially Reasonable Best Efforts_.



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including and
without prejudice to the limits set forth in  _Section 5.1(b)_ and the
remainder of this _Section 5.4_ , each of the Parties agrees to use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws and Governmental Orders to
consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the preparation and filing of all
forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the
Closing and the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any
requisite approvals, authorizations, consents, orders, licenses, permits,
qualifications, exemptions or waivers by any third party or Governmental
Authority.



(b) Each Seller shall, and Holdings shall cause each Seller to, use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to, with respect to each Business
Contract and with respect to each Permit held by either Seller and required to
conduct the Business as conducted immediately prior to the Closing which, as
a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, requires the consent or
approval of the counterparty thereto or any Governmental Authority or will
terminate or be breached in accordance with its terms or pursuant to
applicable Law, obtain such consent or approval or, with respect to a Business
Contract that will otherwise terminate, enter into a new and binding Contract
that can be transferred to Parent or Purchasers without triggering such
a termination on substantially the same terms with such counterparty.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents shall be deemed to constitute an
assignment or transfer of a Business Contract or Permit if the required
consent of the applicable third party has not been obtained. If any such
consent with respect to  



 

37  the Business or an Acquired Asset is not obtained prior to Closing, the
Parties shall in good faith effectuate to the extent reasonably practicable
such arrangements as are necessary to put the Parties in as close an economic
position as commercially practicable to that which the Parties would have been
in had consents been obtained (in each case, an " _Alternative Arrangement_
"). The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that any Alternative Arrangement
would require, among other things, (i) the Seller to remain subject to its
obligations under any Business Contract or Permit with respect to which a
consent to assignment is required under the applicable Business Contract or
Permit but has not been delivered, (ii) the Parent to promptly reimburse the
Sellers for any and all costs, expenses or losses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, incurred by the Sellers as a result of the Sellers taking,
at the request of the Parent or Purchasers, as the case may be, legal or other
action on behalf of or for the benefit of the Parent or Purchasers with
respect to such contracts or as a result of the Parents or a Purchasers
failure to perform the Sellers obligations under such contracts arising on or
after the Closing and to indemnify the Sellers for any Losses relating to the
Parents or Purchasers failure to so perform, and (iii) the Sellers to remit
to the Parent or Purchasers, as the case may be, any payments or refunds
received by the Sellers from any party under the applicable Business Contract
or Permit, in each of the cases described in clauses (i)-(iii), all in a
manner consistent with the purposes and intent of this Agreement. If and when
any such consent shall be obtained, the Sellers shall promptly transfer or
assign, as applicable, such Business Contract or Permit to the Parent
or Purchasers, as the case may be, without payment of consideration.



(c) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, no Party hereto shall take any
action after the date hereof that could reasonably be expected to materially
delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission, approval
or consent from any Governmental Authority or other Person required to be
obtained prior to Closing.



5.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Sellers shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to Sellers, of the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is
likely (a) to cause any representation or warranty of such Party contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at or prior
to the Closing Date, _provided_ , that the failure of any party to give such
notice shall not render any underlying breach of representation or warranty a
breach of, or a failure to comply with, a covenant for the purposes of this
Agreement or (b) to result in any material failure of such Party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to any of the Parties receiving such
notice.



5.6 _Copies and Maintenance of Books and Records_.



(a) Each of the Parties hereto shall preserve, until at least the sixth
anniversary of the Closing Date, all pre-Closing Date records possessed or to
be possessed by such Party relating to the Business and the Acquired Assets,
including those Records that constitute Excluded Assets pursuant to _Section
2.2(d)_.



(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent or Purchasers may identify any Records
(whether electronic, digital, hardcopy or magnetic tape) that constitute
Excluded Assets pursuant to  



 

38   _Section 2.2(e)_ and request that copies of such Records be delivered to
Parent or Purchasers at the Closing. At the Closing, Sellers shall, at no
cost to the requesting Parent or Purchasers (other than for reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses of Sellers), deliver such copies to Parent or Purchasers,
as the case may be. The Parties agree that, to the extent any such Records are
not hardcopies and reside in the systems and hardware that constitute part of
the Acquired Assets, such Records may be maintained on such systems and
hardware and shall be deemed copies of such Records, the delivery of such
systems and hardware shall constitute delivery of such copies and Sellers
shall maintain the originals of such Records, which Records constitute
Excluded Assets.



(c) After the Closing Date and up until at least the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date, upon any reasonable request from a Party hereto or
its Representatives, the Party holding such Records shall (i) provide to the
requesting Party or its Representatives reasonable access to such records
during normal business hours and (ii) permit the requesting Party or its
Representatives to make copies of such records, in each case at no cost to
the requesting Party or its Representatives (other than for reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall require
either Party to disclose any information to the other if such disclosure
would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or contravene any applicable
Law or binding contract. Such records may be sought under this _Section 5.6_
for any reasonable purpose, including to the extent reasonably required by
the Party seeking such records in connection with the need therefore with
respect to ordinary course of business operations, audit, accounting, tax,
litigation or federal securities disclosure matters, Governmental Authority
inquiries, investigations or Proceedings or any other matters similar to any
of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any and all such records may
be destroyed by Holdings and Sellers, on the one hand, or Parent and
Purchasers, on the other hand, if such destroying Parties sends to the other
Parties hereto written notice of their intent to destroy such records,
specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the records to be destroyed;
such records may then be destroyed after the 60th day following such notice
unless the other Parties hereto notify the destroying Parties that such other
Parties desire to obtain possession of such records, in which event the
destroying Parties shall transfer the records to such requesting Parties and
such requesting Parties shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the
destroying Parties in connection therewith.



5.7 _Confidentiality; Public Announcements_.



(a) Parent, on the one hand, and Holdings, Knight, and Sellers on the other
hand, shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and their
respective Representatives to not, issue a press release or otherwise make
public statements with respect to the terms of this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
without the written consent of Holdings or Parent, respectively, except as
required by Law or any listing agreement of any stock exchange or trading
market, _provided_ , that, to the extent practicable, the Parties shall
consult with each other reasonably in advance of making any such disclosures
required by Law or any listing agreement of any stock exchange or trading
market, and _provided_ , _further_ , that such consulting party shall permit
the other party to make non-binding comments with respect to the form or
substance of any such disclosures.



 

39 (b) The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms until Closing, at which time the Confidentiality
Agreement shall only terminate with respect to information relating solely to
the Business, the Acquired Assets and/or the Assumed Liabilities. The
information contained herein, in the Sellers Disclosure Schedules or
delivered to Parent or its Representative pursuant hereto and relating to the
Business, the Acquired Assets and/or the Assumed Liabilities shall be deemed
to be Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) until
the Closing.



(c) From and after the Closing Date, Holdings, Knight and the Sellers shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives to, keep
confidential any and all information concerning the Business, the Acquired
Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, including, without limitation, any Trade
Secrets (including source code) included in the Company Intellectual Property,
prior to the Closing Date (" _Business Confidential Information_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that Business Confidential Information shall not
include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public
or is generally known by individuals in the financial services industry other
than as a result of a disclosure by Holdings, Knight or Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives acting in such capacity in
violation of this Agreement, or (ii) becomes available after the Closing Date
to Holdings, Knight or Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source that is not known
to Holdings, Knight or Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives (acting in such capacity) to be bound by a confidentiality
agreement or other obligation of confidentiality to Parent or Purchasers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Holdings, Knight or either Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives is required to disclose any
Business Confidential Information in response to a court order or as
otherwise required by Law, Holdings, Knight or such Seller, as the case may
be, shall inform Parent of such request or obligation as soon as practicable
after it is informed of it and, if possible, before any information
is disclosed, so that a protective order or other appropriate remedy may be
obtained by Parent at Parents sole expense. If Holdings, Knight or either
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives is obligated
to make the disclosure, it shall only make the disclosure to the extent to
which it is so obligated, but not further or otherwise.



5.8 _Certain Employee Benefits Matters_.



(a) Parent or Purchasers, if any, shall offer employment, effective as of the
Closing to all employees of the Sellers who are actively employed
(including persons who are on vacation, short-term disability or similar
leave) in the operation of the Business as of the Closing (" _Business
Employees_ "), which, except as set forth on _Schedule 5.8(a)_ , such offer of
employment shall include a rate of base salary or wages that is, with respect
to each individual, comparable to or greater than that in effect with respect
to such individual as of immediately prior to Closing. Those Business
Employees who accept such offers of employment on the Closing shall be
referred to herein as the " _Continuing Employees_." Unless otherwise agreed
between Parent and a Continuing Employee, offers of employment to Continuing
Employees shall be on an at-will basis. 



(b) Effective as of the Closing, Continuing Employees shall be exclusively
employees of Parent or its Affiliates. Except as otherwise specifically
provided for in this Agreement, Parent or Purchasers, if any, shall be solely
responsible for, and shall indemnify  



 

40  Sellers and their respective Affiliates, with respect to, all Liabilities of
Sellers relating to any Business Employee that arise from or relate to events
or circumstances occurring prior to, on or following the Closing, including,
without limitation, the actual or constructive termination of any such
Business Employee in connection with or as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(c) As of the Closing, all Business Employees shall cease to accrue benefits
under the Company Benefit Plans, and Knight, Holdings and Sellers shall take
all such action as may be necessary to effect such cessation. There shall be
no transfer of assets or liabilities of the Company Benefit Plans to Parent
or Purchasers, if any, or to any Benefit Plans of Parent or Purchasers, except
as expressly provided herein. Knight and Holdings shall retain all
responsibility for, and neither Parent nor Purchasers, if any, shall have
any obligation or responsibility for any of such benefits under the Company
Benefit Plans.



(d) For the one-year period following the Closing, Parent or Purchasers, if
any, shall provide to each Continuing Employee, employee benefits (excluding
equity or equity-based benefits) that, with respect to each such Continuing
Employee, as Parent may from time to time determine, are, in the aggregate, no
less favorable than (i) the employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-
based benefits) generally in effect for similarly situated employees of Parent
and its subsidiaries or (ii) the employee benefits (excluding equity or
equity-based benefits) to which such Continuing Employee was entitled
immediately prior to Closing.



(e) Parent or Purchasers, if any, shall provide each Continuing Employee who
incurs a termination of employment within a period of one (1) year
immediately following the Closing Date with severance payments and benefits
which are at least equal to the severance payments and benefits to which such
Continuing Employee would have been entitled with respect to such termination
under the severance policies of Knight as set forth on _Schedule 5.8(e)_.
Parent or Purchasers, if any, shall promptly reimburse Sellers and their
Affiliates for, and shall indemnify Sellers and their Affiliates with respect
to, any Liabilities of Sellers (including without limitation severance
payments and benefits) incurred by Sellers or their Affiliates with respect to
those Business Employees (who are not Continuing Employees) whose employment
is terminated in connection with or as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



(f) Parent or Purchasers, if any, will give Continuing Employees full credit
for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and determination of the level of
benefits (including, but not limited to, for purposes of vacation and
severance), but not for purposes of benefit accruals, under any Benefit Plans
maintained by Parent or Purchasers for such Continuing Employees service with
the Sellers to the same extent recognized by Knight, Holdings, or the Sellers
immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. Sellers agree to provide Parent, as soon as practicable, with all
information reasonably requested by Parent to satisfy its obligations under
this _Section 5.8(f)_. Parent or Purchasers, if any, will give Continuing
Employees full credit for vacation days, sick days, and personal days accrued
but unpaid as of the Closing.



(g) Parent and Purchasers, if any, will (i) waive any preexisting condition
limitations otherwise applicable to the Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents under any plan  



 

41  that provides health benefits in which Continuing Employees may be eligible
to participate following the Closing to the extent such conditions are
covered under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employees participated immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) honor any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they
participated immediately prior to Closing during the portion of the calendar
year prior to the Closing and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a
Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the
Closing, in each case to the extent such Continuing Employee or eligible
dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under
an analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing.



(h) Parent or Purchasers, if any, will honor the terms of each employee
compensation arrangement set forth on _Schedule 5.8(h)_.



(i) With respect to Holdings 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the " _Holdings
401(k) Plan_ "), on or prior to Closing, Knight, Holdings, or Sellers shall
cause all Continuing Employees who are participants in the Seller 401(k) Plan
to be fully vested in their respective accounts thereunder. As soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee who is a
participant in the Holdings 401(k) Plan shall have the right to elect to
receive a distribution of all or a portion of such employees account balance
in the Holdings 401(k) Plan (subject to, and in accordance with, the
provisions of the Holdings 401(k) Plan and applicable Law). Parent or
Purchasers, if any, shall designate a tax-qualified defined contribution plan
of the Parent or Purchasers or one of their respective subsidiaries that
provides for the receipt of "eligible rollover distributions" (as such term
is defined under Section 402 of the Code) (such plan, the " _Purchaser s
401(k) Plan_") and the Parent or Purchasers shall take all necessary action,
if requested to do so by a Continuing Employee, to cause the trustee of the
Purchasers 401(k) Plan to accept the direct "roll over" of all or a portion
of any distribution (excluding outstanding loan balances) from the Holdings
401(k) Plan (subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
Purchasers 401(k) Plan and applicable Law). Parent or Purchasers, if any,
will use commercially reasonable best efforts to assist each Continuing
Employee who, as of the Closing, has an outstanding loan balance with respect
to such employees account balance in Holdings 401(k) Plan, to satisfy such
employees repayment obligations with respect to such loan, either by loan,
advance or otherwise as determined by Parent or Purchasers, if any, in their
sole discretion.



(j) Sellers shall be, or shall cause the applicable welfare benefit plans of
Knight to be, responsible for providing welfare benefits (including medical,
hospital, dental, accidental death and dismemberment, life, disability and
other similar benefits) to current and former employees of the Sellers for
all claims incurred prior to the Closing under and subject to the generally
applicable terms and conditions of the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements in which such employees were entitled to participate immediately
prior to the Closing. For purposes of this _Section 5.8(j)_ , a claim is
incurred with respect to accidental death and dismemberment, disability, life
and other similar benefits when the event giving rise to such claim occurred.
A claim is incurred with respect to medical, dental, and other similar
benefits when the services with respect to such claim are rendered. Any claim
above that relates to a  



 

42  continuous period of hospitalization shall be deemed to be incurred at the
commencement of such period of hospitalization.



(k) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing contained in this _Section 5.8_ , express or implied, shall be
interpreted to confer upon any Person (including any employee of Sellers) any
rights or remedies as a third-party beneficiary, including any rights of
continued employment, any rights to a particular term of employment or any
rights to any particular compensation or benefits whatsoever (including any
form of notice or severance pay). The right to enforce any terms of this
_Section 5.8_ shall inure only to the Parties and shall in no way extend to
any third parties who might benefit from the terms of this Agreement in any
way, including any employee of Sellers.



(l) The Parties intend to utilize Standard Procedure described in Section 4 of
IRS Revenue Procedure 96-60, 1996-2 Cum. Bull. 399 with respect to Continuing
Employees. Sellers shall provide information and data to Parent upon request
with respect to wages and payroll taxes with respect to the Continuing
Employees for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs.



(m) Sellers shall give notice, in accordance with all applicable Laws,
to those Business Employees (and their dependents) who lose coverage under a
Seller group health plan as result of the consummation of the actions
contemplated by this Agreement (" _COBRA Eligible Individuals_ ") of such
individuals rights to continuation coverage under Section 4980B of the Code
(" _COBRA_ "). To the extent required by Law, Sellers or their Affiliates, as
applicable, shall provide continuation coverage under COBRA for those COBRA
Eligible Individuals who timely elect COBRA continuation coverage from
Sellers.



5.9 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.



(a) Each of Holdings, Knight and the Sellers agrees that it will not (and will
cause each of its respective Affiliates not to), without the prior written
consent of Parent, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any
other Person, (i) prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
solicit, aid, induce or encourage any individual, who is an employee of either
of the Sellers with respect to the Business as of the date hereof or
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Designated Employees_ ") to
leave his or her employment relationship with the Business either as an
employee of either Seller prior to the Closing or as an employee of Parent or
Purchasers as of or after the Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ , that it is
understood that this _Section 5.9(a)(i)_ shall not prohibit: (A) solicitation
of any Designated Employee who contacts Holdings, Knight, Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates on his or her own initiative without any
solicitation by or encouragement from Holdings, Knight, Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates; (B) any solicitation by a professional search
firm where none of Holdings, Knight, Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates has, directly or indirectly, directed such firm to
solicit that person; (C) generalized solicitations by advertising and the like
which are not specifically directed to the Designated Employees; or (D)
solicitations of any Designated Employee whose employment was terminated,
without cause, by Parent or Purchasers on or after the Closing or (ii) prior
to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, hire or otherwise engage, or
assist any Person in hiring or otherwise engaging, any such Designated
Employee who has been employed with respect to the Business by either Seller,
Parent or Purchasers, as the case may be, within the  



 

43  immediately preceding twelve (12) months; _provided_ , _however_ , that it
is understood that this _Section 5.9(a)(ii)_ shall not prohibit the hiring or
otherwise engaging (or assisting any Person in hiring or otherwise engaging)
of any Designated Employee whose employment was terminated, without cause, by
Parent or Purchasers on or after the Closing.



(b) Each of Holdings, Knight, and Sellers agrees that it will not (and
will cause each of their respective Affiliates not to), without the prior
written consent of Parent, directly or indirectly, prior to the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, solicit any Person who is a client or
customer of a Restricted Business as of the Closing Date for the purposes of
providing any products or services of a type substantially similar to any of
those provided by a Restricted Business.



(c) Each of Holdings, Knight, and Sellers agrees that it will not (and will
cause each of their respective Affiliates not to), without the prior
written consent of Parent, directly or indirectly, prior to the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, engage in or carry on in any capacity,
directly or indirectly (including as stockholder, investor, member, partner,
principal, proprietor, independent contractor, agent or, outside of the
relevant Persons ordinary course of business, creditor; provided that in no
event will acting as creditor to a Restricted Business be considered in the
relevant Persons ordinary course of business if the relevant Person
receives, in connection with its acting as creditor, equity securities or
securities that by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for equity
securities of such Restricted Business whether immediately or upon
the passage of time or the occurrence of specified events), any business,
trade or venture substantially similar to a Restricted Business in the United
States or Canada; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the ownership of less than
5% of any class of the issued and outstanding securities of a Person engaged
in a Restricted Business shall not constitute a violation of _Sections 5.9(b)
and (c)_ if (A) such class of securities of such Person is traded on a
national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market or (B) such
class of securities of such Person is not so traded on a national securities
exchange or in the over-the-counter market so long as the Restricted
Businesses in which such Person is engaged do not generate over fifteen
percent (15%) of such Persons annual gross revenues and (ii) entering into or
engaging in a Restricted Business as a result of any acquisition, asset
purchase, merger, consolidation or similar business combination shall not
constitute a violation of _Sections 5.9(b) and (c)_ if (x) such transaction
results in a change in control of Knight or (y) the Person with which such
transaction occurs is a Person whose Restricted Businesses prior to the
transaction do not generate over fifteen percent (15%) of such Persons
annual gross revenues and, after such transaction and through the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Restricted Businesses of such Person are
conducted on a scale and on a basis substantially similar to the scale and
basis on which they were conducted prior to the transaction. Notwithstanding
the provisions of _Sections 5.9(b) and (c)_ and for the sake of clarity, each
of Holdings, Knight and Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall at all
times be permitted to engage in any business which they presently conduct
other than the Business sold pursuant to this Agreement and then only to the
extent set forth above. In the event that any of Holdings, Knight and Sellers
or their respective Affiliates shall sell to a Person that is not an Affiliate
of Holdings, Knight or Sellers any portion of its business, whether by means
of acquisition, asset purchase, merger, consolidation, similar
business combination or otherwise, the restrictions and agreements contained
in this _Section 5.9_ shall not prohibit any such sale and shall not apply to
any such Person.



 

44 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Restricted Businesses" means the material
components of the Business relating to the activities of (i) acting as a
Specialist, DPM, LMM, PMM, CMM, RMM or Market Maker (each a " _Registered
Function_ "), as such terms are recognized by any of the American Stock
Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the Boston Stock Exchange, the
Chicago Board Options Exchange, the International Securities Exchange, the
Pacific Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
or the New York Mercantile Exchange, in listed equity options, listed index
options, and listed options on futures contracts, either on an exchange floor
or in an electronic exchange venue and (ii) soliciting customers for the best-
execution routing or brokering of execution orders for trades in listed
equity options and listed index options; _provided, however_ , that the
definition of Restricted Business shall specifically exclude the routing or
brokering of execution orders for trades in any products on an unsolicited
electronic customer initiated basis through direct market access technology,
services or products so long as, with respect to the routing of listed equity
options and listed index options execution orders, such routing is made only
to an intermediary that is not an Affiliate of Holdings, Knight or Sellers.
For the sake of clarity, the definition of "Restricted Business" shall also
specifically exclude (a) any activities relating to equity, index or other
securities which are not listed options, listed index options or listed
options on futures, including the trading, routing or brokering of any such
other securities, or (b) the trading of any options or other derivative
securities in any capacity other than in a Registered Function. Further for
the sake of clarity, the terms "equity securities" and "equity options" shall
include exchange traded funds and the options on exchange traded funds
respectively.



(e) The Parties agree that the remedy at law for any breach of the
foregoing will be inadequate and that Purchaser, in addition to any other
relief available to it, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damages.



(f) Each of Holdings, Knight and Sellers agrees that this _Section 5.9_
 shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants, one for each state,
territory and jurisdiction of the United States and each foreign jurisdiction
in which the Restricted Businesses purport to conduct business. With respect
to any judicial proceeding, each of Holdings, Knight and Sellers further
agrees that (i) if a court or arbitrator shall refuse to enforce any of these
separate covenants, such unenforceable covenants shall be deemed eliminated
from the provisions hereof for the purposes of such proceeding to the extent
necessary for the remaining separate covenants to be enforced in such
proceeding and (ii) if a court or arbitrator shall refuse to enforce one or
more of the separate covenants because the total time thereof is deemed to be
excessive or unreasonable, then such covenants which would otherwise be
unenforceable due to such excessive or unreasonable period of time shall be
enforced for such lesser period of time as shall be deemed reasonable and
not excessive by such court or arbitrator.



5.10 _Transition Services Agreement_.



(a) The Parties agree that they shall, as soon as practicable after the date
hereof, negotiate in good faith to prepare and agree upon a transition
services agreement (such agreement, the " _Transition Services Agreement_ "),
to be entered into between the appropriate parties, which Transition Services
Agreement will provide (i) for the provision of such services by Holdings,
Knight and their respective Affiliates, as appropriate, to Parent and/or
Purchasers, as applicable, and for the use, by Parent and/or Purchasers, as
applicable, of such assets held in  



 

45  whole or in part by Holdings, Knight or their respective Affiliates that are
not Acquired Assets, as in each case are reasonably necessary to enable
Parent and/or Purchasers, as applicable, to continue operating the Business
substantially as it is operated as of immediately prior to the Closing (the "
_Services_ "), (ii) that the initial term for the Services shall be from the
Closing Date until the six month anniversary thereof, subject to such
extensions as the Parties may agree in the Transition Services Agreement,
(iii) that the fees for the Services (A) provided by third parties shall be a
pass-through of the actual out-of pocket costs and expenses incurred by
Holdings, Knight or their respective Affiliates in providing the Services and
(B) provided by Holdings, Knight or their respective Affiliates shall be the
Fully-Burdened Costs incurred by Holdings, Knight or their respective
Affiliates in providing the Services and (iv) payment of all fees contemplated
by clause (iii) above shall be subject to provision by Holdings, Knight or the
applicable Affiliate thereof of reasonable supporting documentation
evidencing such fees. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Fully-Burdened
Costs_ " shall mean (1) the portion of an employees salary, bonus and
benefits accrued by Holdings, Knight or the applicable Affiliate for the
period of time during which such Services are provided based on the amount of
time reasonably estimated by Holdings, Knight or the applicable Affiliate that
such employee devoted to providing such Services, (2) the actual costs of
transportation, meals and lodging for any employee traveling away from home
and overnight to provide such Services, (3) a reasonable per mileage rate for
automobile travel incurred by such employee and required to provide such
Services, (4) the actual costs of long distance telephone calls and
facsimiles placed in connection with providing such Services, (5) the actual
costs for printing, postage and overnight courier charges incurred in
connection with providing such Services, (6) the actual costs for supplies or
other materials purchased by Holdings, Knight or the applicable Affiliate to
provide such Services and (7) the portion of the actual occupancy and support
costs reasonably allocated to the Business relating to the disaster recovery
facility located in Purchase, New York.



(b) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, Knight, Holdings and
Sellers will in good faith cooperate with Parent and Purchasers and use their
reasonable best efforts to identify all services and assets contemplated by
_Section 5.10(a)(i)_ above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as agreed
to in writing by Holdings and Parent or otherwise set forth in the Transition
Services Agreement, all products and services provided to the Business, as
applicable, by Holdings, Knight and their respective Affiliates, including
any agreements or understandings (written or oral) with respect thereto,
shall terminate simultaneously with the Closing without any further action or
liability on the part of the parties thereto. Further, in the absence of a
written agreement (including the Transition Services Agreement), the
provision of any services by Holdings, Knight, Sellers or their respective
Affiliates to Parent and/or Purchasers from and after the Closing shall be for
the convenience, and at the expense, of the recipients thereof only and shall
be furnished without any liability on the part of Holdings, Knight, Sellers
and their respective Affiliates with respect thereto.



(c) Subject to licensor consent of any third-party Software used in connection
with the Disaster Recovery Software (as defined below), as well as the terms
of the applicable license agreements, each Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, hereby grants to Parent a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-
transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicenseable (except to Parents
Affiliates in connection with the Business), royalty-free license to
reproduce, use and modify (including to create derivative works from) the
Software currently used in the disaster recovery facility operated by Holdings
and its Affiliates which services the Business, including  



 

46  all related compiler command files, build scripts, object libraries, and all
relevant documentation (including all design, operating and user
documentation and a list of commercially available third party software
and/or tools necessary for the use and maintenance of such Software and
related materials) (collectively, the " _Disaster Recovery Software_ ") solely
for the purpose of permitting Parent to review the Disaster Recovery Software
in order to facilitate compliance as of the Closing Date of Parents and its
Affiliates disaster recovery facilities with applicable Laws and internal
policies and standards of Parent and its Affiliates relating to disaster
recovery and continuity of business in respect of the Business. The license
shall terminate upon the earlier of the Closing or termination of this
Agreement. Upon Closing, the foregoing license shall terminate and Parent or
Purchasers, as the case may be, shall become the owner(s) of the Disaster
Recovery Software, which, for the avoidance of doubt, constitutes Company
Intellectual Property. If the foregoing license is terminated as a result
of termination of this Agreement, upon termination, Parent shall cease all
use of the Disaster Recovery Software and shall destroy all tangible copies of
such Disaster Recovery Software and any derivative works thereof developed by
Parent. In furtherance of the foregoing, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the execution of this Agreement and in any event within ten (10)
calendar days thereof, the Sellers shall deliver to Parent a copy of the
Disaster Recovery Software. From the date of this Agreement through the
Closing (and thereafter in accordance with the terms of the Transition
Services Agreement), KFP shall respond to the reasonable inquiries of Parent
and the Purchasers concerning the Disaster Recovery Software, which inquiries
shall be limited to information sought by Parent or the Purchasers, as
applicable to assist Parent or the Purchasers (i) in making Parents and its
Affiliates disaster recovery facilities compliant with applicable Law
and such internal policies and standards in respect of the Business as soon
as reasonably practicable following Closing and (ii) integrate the Business
within Parents and its Affiliates existing infrastructure, including by
providing personnel to respond to questions and otherwise to assist with
respect to such compliance and integration. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this _Section 5.10_ , for the purposes of the interim license
granted under this _Section 5.10_ , and without prejudice to the express
warranties in _Section 3.12_ , the Disaster Recovery Software licensed
hereunder is being provided "AS IS" AND THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.



5.11 _Liquid Transactions_. Holdings and KEP shall (i) inform Parent of, and
provide Parent with, all material facts regarding developments concerning the
Liquid Transactions and the negotiations with respect thereto, including
copies of all draft documents prepared and exchanged between the parties to
the Liquid Transactions, unless otherwise restricted by Applicable Law or
agreement (provided that Holdings and KEP shall use commercially reasonable
best effort to obtain any consent of the counterparty to any such agreement
necessary to disclose such information), and (ii) work in good faith to enter
into definitive agreements with the other parties to the Liquid Transactions
prior to the Closing, on terms consistent in all material respects with the
Liquid Term Sheet (with such changes thereto as have been disclosed to Parent
prior to the date hereof), subject in all cases to the exercise of the
Holdings, KEPs and/or their Affiliates reasonable commercial discretion
and the participation of the other parties to the Liquid Term Sheet;
_provided_ , that Holdings shall cause KEP not to, and KEP shall not, enter
into any such definitive agreements without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and
_provided_ , _further_ , that, for the sake  



 

47  of clarity, if KEP does enter into such definitive agreements with the
consent of Parent, its rights and obligations thereunder shall be an Acquired
Asset. 



5.12 _Expense Allocations_. From and including the date hereof to and
including the Closing Date, Holdings shall not permit corporate overhead
expenses of Holdings and its Affiliates to be allocated to either or both of
the Sellers in an amount greater than the product of (i) the number of days
from and including the date hereof to and including the Closing Date _times_
(ii) the aggregate amount of corporate overhead expenses that were so
allocated to either or both of the Sellers during the six-month period ending
April 30, 2004 (as set forth in the Combined Financial Statements) _divided
by_ the aggregate number of days in such six-month period.



5.13 _Intercompany Arrangements_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Holdings and its Affiliates shall be permitted to manage all
Intercompany Accounts between the Sellers, on the one hand, and Holdings and
its Affiliates (excluding the Sellers), on the other hand, in the sole
discretion of Holdings, _provided_ , that such Intercompany Accounts (other
than as they relate specifically to cash management which may be managed in
the sole discretion of Holdings and its Affiliates without reference to the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice) are managed in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
to the extent the Sellers have any outstanding indebtedness owing to Holdings
and its Affiliates (other than the Sellers) immediately prior to Closing that
is to otherwise to be assumed by Parent or Purchasers pursuant to this
Agreement (the " _Outstanding Indebtedness_ "), Holdings shall (i) in the
first instance, use its commercially reasonable best efforts to arrange for
Parent or Purchasers, as applicable, to borrow an amount necessary on terms
reasonably acceptable to Parent to pay off the Outstanding Indebtedness in
full at Closing, or (ii) if Holdings is unable to arrange for the borrowing
as contemplated in clause (i), require Parent to, or cause Purchasers to,
repay the Outstanding Indebtedness in full at Closing (such repaid amount to
be in addition to the Purchase Price paid in accordance with _Section 2.2_
above). In addition, except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, all agreements and commitments, whether written, oral or otherwise,
which are solely between the Sellers, on the one hand, and Holdings and its
Affiliates (excluding the Sellers), on the other hand, shall not be assigned
to or assumed by Parent or Purchasers notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary herein.



5.14 _Treatment of Knight Guaranties_.



(a) Parent and Holdings shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable
best efforts to have released and cancelled at the Closing each
Knight Guaranty listed on _Schedule 3.22_ if the underlying Contract to which
such Knight Guaranty relates is assigned to and assumed by Parent or
Purchasers, other than the guarantee by Knight with respect to the MLPro
Clearing Agreement (provided that Parent shall not be required to pay any
amounts (other than de minimis amounts) to obtain any such release and
cancellation); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that any such
Knight Guaranty listed on _Schedule 3.22_ or that otherwise involves a de
minimis amount cannot be so released and cancelled, Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause itself or an Affiliate thereof
to be substituted for Knight and each of Knights Affiliates directly
affected thereby in respect of such Knight Guaranty as it relates to events,
occurrences or actions arising on or after the Closing (or, if not possible,
added as the  



 

48  primary obligor with respect thereto) ( _provided_ that Parent shall not be
required to pay any amounts (other than de minimis amounts) to achieve
such substitution). If the Parties are not able to either release and cancel
such Knight Guaranty or Parent is not able to cause itself or an Affiliate
thereof to be so substituted in all respects in regard of such Knight
Guaranty, then Parent shall (a) obtain and deliver to Holdings at the Closing
letters of credit in favor of Holdings, on terms and conditions, and from
financial institutions, which in each case are reasonably satisfactory to
Holdings, with respect to all the obligations covered by each such Knight
Guaranty that relate to events, occurrences or actions arising on and after
the Closing and (b) otherwise indemnify, defend and hold harmless Holdings and
each such Affiliate of Holdings with respect to all liabilities or expenses
that might arise or be incurred by Holdings or such Affiliate of Holdings with
respect to any such Knight Guaranty as it relates to events, occurrences, or
actions arising on or after the Closing.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and for
the sake of clarity, if the underlying Contract to which a Knight Guaranty
relates is not assigned to and assumed by Parent or Purchasers, _Section
5.14(a)_ shall not apply in any respect to such Knight Guaranty. Furthermore,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including
_Section 5.14(a)_ , Parent will not be in violation of any provision of this
Agreement for its deciding, in its sole discretion, not to have itself or an
Affiliate thereof substituted for Knight and Knights Affiliates under any
Knight Guaranty providing for a general security interest or right of setoff
against the guarantor or its assets and such decision results in the
underlying Contract not being assigned to and assumed by Parent or
Purchasers.



5.15 _Insurance Policies_. 



(a) Except as provided in _Section 5.15(c)_ , Parent shall not, and shall
cause Parents Affiliates not to, assert, by way of claim, action, litigation
or otherwise, any right to any Insurance Policy or any benefit under any such
Insurance Policy. Holdings and its Affiliates shall retain all right, title
and interest in and to the Insurance Policies, including the right to any
credit or return premiums due, paid or payable in connection with the
termination thereof.



(b) Except as provided in _Section 5.15(c)_ , at the Closing, Parent shall
release, and shall cause its Affiliates to release, all rights to all
Insurance Policies or similar insurance which covered the Business prior to
the Closing Date. All Insurance Policies issued prior to the Closing Date in
the name of or to the Sellers shall remain with Sellers or their Affiliates.



(c) With respect to any events or circumstances pertaining to the Business
that relate to the period prior to the Closing and are eligible for coverage
under an occurrence-based Insurance Policy (such events or circumstances, an "
_Insurance Matter_ "), upon reasonable request by Parent, Holdings will, or
will cause its Affiliates as applicable to, after the Closing, pursue at
Parents sole expense coverage under the relevant Insurance Policy for the
benefit of Parent or the Purchasers, as applicable, to the extent of coverage
existing for such Insurance Matter; _provided_ , that Holdings and its
Affiliates, as applicable, will not be responsible for paying any deductible
with respect to such coverage; and _provided_ , _further_ , that to the
extent Holdings or its Affiliates, as applicable, have outstanding claims
under the relevant Insurance Policy and such claims (along with any other
claims previously made under the relevant Insurance Policy) together with the
claims for the Insurance Matter would exceed the maximum coverage available
 



 

49  under such Insurance Policy, the claims of Holdings and its Affiliates shall
take precedence over the Insurance Matter. If any amount is paid in respect
of an Insurance Matter and thereafter Holdings or its Affiliates have claims
under the relevant Insurance Policy, which, when taken together with the
claims for the Insurance Matter and any other claims previously made under the
relevant Insurance Policy, would exceed the maximum coverage available under
such Insurance Policy, Parent shall reimburse Holdings or its Affiliates, as
applicable, for any amounts (up to the full amount paid on the Insurance
Matter) not covered as a result of so exceeding the maximum coverage. Parent
shall notify Holdings promptly of any such Insurance Matter for which Parent
or Purchasers, as applicable, seek coverage under an Insurance Policy and
shall keep Holdings fully informed regarding the status of the Insurance
Matter.



5.16 _Class B ISE Stock at Closing_. Knight and Holdings shall ensure that,
as of the Closing, KFP will have, and at the Closing will transfer to Parent
or Purchasers, as applicable, good and marketable title to all of the shares
of Class B ISE Stock set forth on  _Schedule 3.21_ , free and clear of all
Liens except for Liens created by this Agreement and Liens arising under any
applicable federal or state securities Laws, and there shall be no amounts due
to Adirondack Trading Partners, LLC with respect to such shares.



5.17 _Proprietary Trading Master Clearing Agreement_. Parent (i) acknowledges
that KFP is party to that certain Master Clearing Agreement, dated May 19,
2003, between Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (" _MLPro_ ") and KFP
(the " _MLPro Clearing Agreement_ ") and to an assignment and assumption
agreement between MLPro and KFP, dated August 7, 2004, relating to the MLPro
Clearing Agreement, (ii) acknowledges and agrees to the terms set forth in
such assignment and assumption agreement, (iii) agrees that it will cause to
be executed and delivered, as of the Closing, and if required by MLPro
pursuant to such assignment and assumption agreement, the guaranty
contemplated by such assignment and assumption agreement, and (iv) shall
indemnify and hold harmless Holdings, Sellers and their Affiliates from and
against any and all liabilities arising out of or related to the MLPro
Clearing Agreement with respect to acts, omissions or events that occur on or
following the Closing.



5.18 _Real Estate Estoppel Certificates_. Prior to Closing, Holdings shall
use its commercially reasonable best efforts to have delivered duly executed
real estate estoppel certificates from each lessor under those Real Property
Leases set forth on _Schedule 3.13(b)_ , substantially in the form set forth
on _Schedule 5.18_. __



5.19 _Assignment or Sublease of Real Property Leases_.



(a) Prior to Closing, with respect to those Real Property Leases under which a
Seller is not the lessee (other than the Real Property Lease for the property

5.20 _Further Assurances_. At any time and from time to time, each Party to
this Agreement agrees, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
to take such commercially reasonable actions and to execute and deliver such
documents as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement at
the earliest practicable time, including such actions and the execution
and delivery of such documents after the Closing as may be necessary or
appropriate to transfer more effectively, assign, convey, grant, deliver and
confirm to Parent or Purchasers, as the case may be, or to perfect or record
Parents or Purchasers, as the case may be, title to or interest in the
Acquired Assets.



5.21 _Trademarks; Tradenames_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, except as expressly provided below, the use by the
Business of the Retained Names and Marks shall cease as of the Closing Date.
Parent and Purchasers, will, and will cause the Business to, (a) as promptly
as practicable following the Closing Date, but in any event within two hundred
forty (240) days thereafter, remove or obliterate all the Retained Names and
Marks, from its signs, purchase orders, invoices, sales orders, labels,
letterheads, packaging, shipping documents and other items and materials in
the possession, custody or control of Parent and Purchasers after the Closing,
and (b) not put into use after the Closing Date any such items and materials
that bear any Retained Name or Mark or any name, mark or logo similar thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a period of two hundred forty (240) days
after the Closing Date, Parent and Purchasers may use in the Business any
purchase orders, invoices, sales orders, labels, letterheads, packaging or
shipping documents existing on the Closing Date that bear any Retained Name or
Mark or any name, mark or logo similar thereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, to the extent reasonably practicable, such items shall be stickered or
otherwise marked to clearly indicate that none of Holdings, Sellers or any of
their Affiliates are affiliated with Parent, Purchasers or the Business.
Parent and Purchasers agree that Holdings and Sellers shall have no
responsibility for claims by third parties arising out of, or relating to, the
use by Parent and Purchasers or any Affiliate thereof of any Retained Names
or Marks after the Closing Date, and Parent agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from any and all Losses that may arise
out of the use thereof by Parent and Purchasers or any Affiliate thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly understood by the Parties that
Parent and Purchasers may elect to operate the Business, and may elect to seek
to protect its Intellectual Property rights under applicable Law, after the
Closing using trademarks such as "Citigroup Execution Partners" and/or
"Citigroup Financial Products," and such other trademarks that use the words
"Execution Partner" and "Financial Products" in combination with other
trademarks of Parent or Purchasers, and that neither Holdings nor its
Affiliates shall challenge the right of Parent or Purchasers to do so.



5.22 _Software License_. The Parties agree that they shall, as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, negotiate in good faith to prepare and
agree upon software license agreements (each such agreement, a " _Software
License Agreement_ "), to be entered into between the appropriate parties,
which Software License Agreements will provide (i) Deephaven Capital  



 

51  Markets LLC (" _Deephaven_ ") with a limited, personal, non-exclusive,
royalty-free, non-transferable and non-assignable license to use the Options
Market Making Software (" _OMM_ ") in connection with the business of
Deephaven for a period of time sufficient to allow Deephaven to transition to
replacement Software, such time period not to extend for longer than one
(1) year from the Closing Date; and (ii) Knight Equity Markets, L.P. (" _KEM_
") with a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to use those portions
of the OMM Software that are currently used by KEM, solely as such portions
are currently used by KEM in connection with its business as currently
conducted; _provided_ that KEM shall not have any right to sublicense such OMM
Software, except that KEM may sublicense to its customers on terms and
conditions that are consistent with its current business practices; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the license to KEM shall be non-transferable and
non-assignable, except in the case of the sale or transfer of all or
substantially all of KEMs assets, or in connection with the acquisition of
KEM by another entity or the merger or other transfer of KEM with or to any
other entity. For the avoidance of doubt, a change of control of KEM shall not
be deemed an assignment for purposes of either such Software License
Agreement.



5.23 _Third Party Software_. Holdings and Parent acknowledge and agree that,
subject to licensor consent (as required), as well as the terms of the
applicable license agreements, Holdings shall assign to Parent or Purchasers,
as applicable, all third-party Software licensed by Holdings or its
Affiliates but used primarily by the Business as of the Closing Date, other
than any Excluded Intellectual Property; _provided_ , that with respect to any
licenses to third-party Software set forth on  _Schedule 5.23_ , which
Software is currently used both by the Sellers in the Business and by other
Affiliates of Holdings in other businesses (hereinafter collectively referred
to as " _Shared Third Party Software_ "), Holdings shall, and shall cause
each of its Affiliates which is a licensee to the Contract under which such
Shared Third Party Software is licensed to, use its commercially reasonable
best efforts to, partition the licenses in such Contract and assign to Parent
or the Purchasers, as applicable, those licenses under such Contract which are
used to conduct the Business as currently conducted (the " _Business Licenses_
"), including, as and to the extent required, to obtain the consent of the
licensor counterparty to any such Contract to assign such Business Licenses.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents shall be deemed to constitute an
assignment of such Business Licenses if the required consent of the
applicable licensor counterparty has not been obtained. If any such consent
with respect to the Business Licenses is not obtained prior to Closing, the
Parties shall in good faith effectuate an Alternative Arrangement in respect
thereof, it being understood that with respect to the Business Licenses, the
Alternative Arrangements shall not require the actions required by clauses (i)
 (iii) of _Section 5.4(b)_ , but shall instead require that to the extent
Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, obtains new licenses to replace the
Business Licenses which cannot be assigned, Sellers shall make Parent or the
Purchasers, as applicable, whole for any up-front reasonable payments
to third parties incurred by Parent or the Purchasers, as applicable, which
would not have been incurred had such Business Licenses been assigned. If and
when any such consent shall be obtained, the Sellers shall promptly transfer
or assign, as applicable, the Business Licenses to the Parent or the
Purchasers, as applicable, without payment of consideration. _Schedule 5.23_
lists the Shared Third Party Software identified by the Parties as of the date
hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Parties agree to supplement and amend such _Schedule 5.23_ to correct
inaccuracies, omissions or oversights, in order to accomplish the objectives
of this _Section 5.23_ ,  



 

52  prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that, Holdings shall be responsible
for all costs associated with acquiring any additional items added to 
_Schedule 5.23_.



5.24 _IP Assignments by Developers_. Holdings shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use all commercially reasonable efforts to have executed and
delivered prior to Closing Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements
substantially in the form set forth on  _Schedule 5.24_ from each of Nissim
Cohen, Omri Hurvitz, Yael Sharon, Eran Hammer-Lahav, Opher Lekach, Katherine
Schriver, Alfred Rechester and Larry Freund.



5.25 _Post-Closing Management of Inquiries and Access_. Following the Closing,
Sellers shall, and Holdings shall ensure that Sellers, in all cases subject
to the exercise of Sellers reasonable sole discretion, cooperate fully and
appropriately with, respond fully and appropriately to, and manage the process
in interacting and communicating with any Governmental Authority in
connection with any inquiry, investigation or Proceeding concerning the
Business as conducted prior to the Closing, including with respect to any of
the matters set forth on _Schedule 2.4(c)_. Without limiting the foregoing,
Holdings shall ensure that Sellers have access to the adequate personnel
(legal, compliance, or otherwise) to fulfill their obligations under this
_Section 5.25_. Holdings and Sellers acknowledge and agree that, subject to
_Section 8.3(a)(iv)_ , neither Parent nor Purchasers shall be responsible for
managing the process of addressing any such inquiry, investigation or
Proceeding made to or brought against Sellers. Parent and Purchasers shall,
upon the reasonable request of Sellers and upon reasonable advance notice
provide to Holdings, Sellers and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives such access to such employees (and cause the cooperation of
such employees), offices and other facilities and to all books and records of
the Business as could reasonably be expected to assist Holdings and Sellers in
fulfilling their obligations under this _Section 5.25_ or in otherwise
addressing or dealing with any Retained Liabilities; _provided_ , that
the Parties will reasonably cooperate to minimize the disruption of any such
access and cooperation to the normal operations of the Business.

indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties under _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_ ) incurred
by any Purchaser Indemnified Party resulting from any breach of any of the
representations or warranties of Sellers set forth in _Article 3_ of this
Agreement solely to the extent such representation or warranty is made,
pursuant to the preamble to _Article 3_ , as of the Closing Date (for
the sake of clarity, to the extent a representation or warranty is made as of
the Closing Date pursuant to such preamble but speaks as of a specified date,
a breach of such representation or warranty shall be subject to

date);



 

57 (ii) any and all Losses incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party resulting

not be limited or affected by any investigation conducted or notice or
knowledge obtained by or on behalf of any such Persons.



(b) No indemnification under _Sections 8.2(a)(i)_ shall be due unless the
aggregate amount of all Losses (aggregating all indemnifiable matters under
such Section) exceeds one percent (1%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Basket
Amount_ "), in which case Holdings and Sellers shall provide indemnification
with respect to such Losses addressed by _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ in excess of the
Basket Amount; _provided_ , that this _Section 8.2(b)_ shall not apply with
respect to any breach of a representation or warranty contained in _Sections
3.4_ , _3.7_ or _3.10_.



(c) The maximum amount of Losses against which the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified under _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ shall be twenty-five percent (25%) of the Purchase Price (the "
_Cap Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply
with respect to any breach of a representation or warranty contained in
_Section 3.4_ , for which the maximum amount of Losses against which the

(d) The amount of Losses subject to indemnification under this _Section 8.2_
shall be computed after giving effect to any Tax benefit actually realized and
utilized in the current Tax year and any Tax detriment actually suffered, in
each case, by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and any insurance proceeds
received by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties. In computing the Tax detriment
actually suffered under this _Section 8.2(d)_ , Purchaser Indemnified Parties,
in addition to taking into account all other Tax detriments, shall be
entitled to include the net present value of any lost depreciation or
amortization or other Tax detriment in a taxable year in which there is a
reasonable likelihood that such amount will be realized, using a discount
rate of 10%.



 

58 8.3 _Indemnification by Parent_.



(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 8.3_ , from
and after the Closing Date, Parent and Purchasers shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify and hold harmless Holdings, Sellers and their Affiliates
(and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees, successors

(i) any and all Losses incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party resulting from
any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Parent set forth in
_Article 4_ of this Agreement solely to the extent such representation or
warranty is made, pursuant to the preamble to _Article 4_ , as of the Closing
Date (for the sake of clarity, to the extent a representation or warranty is
made as of the Closing Date pursuant to such preamble but speaks as of
a specified date, a breach of such representation or warranty shall be
subject to indemnification pursuant to this clause (i) by reference to such
specified date);



(ii) any and all Losses incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party resulting
from any failure to perform, or other breach of, any of the covenants or
agreements of Parent or Purchasers, in either case contained in this
Agreement;



(iii) any and all Losses incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party resulting
from any Assumed Liability; and



(iv) other than, for the sake of clarity, (A) those matters for which
Holdings and Sellers are to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ and (B) such Liabilities that are
specifically excluded from this clause (iv) pursuant to footnote 1 to
_Schedule 2.5_ , any and all Losses incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party
resulting from any Retained Liability set forth in _Section 2.4(a)_ (which
Losses shall include, for the sake of clarity, the Retained Liability itself).



(b) No indemnification under _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ shall be due unless
the aggregate amount of all Losses (aggregating all indemnifiable matters
under such Section) exceeds the Basket Amount in which case Parent and
Purchasers shall provide indemnification with respect to such Losses in excess
of the Basket Amount;  _provided_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not
apply with respect to any breach of a representation or warranty contained in
_Sections 4.4_ , _4.5_ , _4.7_ , and _4.8_.



(c) The maximum amount of Losses against which the Seller Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified under _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ shall
be the Cap Amount; _provided_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not apply
with respect to any breach of a representation or warranty contained in
_Sections 4.4_ ,  _4.5_ , _4.7_ , and _4.8_ for which there shall be no
maximum amount of Losses against which the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to be indemnified.



(d) The amount of Losses subject to indemnification under this _Section 8.3_
shall be computed after giving effect to any Tax benefit actually realized
and utilized in the current Tax year and any Tax detriment actually suffered,
in each case, by the Seller Indemnified Parties and any insurance proceeds
received by the Seller Indemnified Parties. In computing the Tax detriment
actually suffered under this _Section 8.3(d)_ , Seller Indemnified Parties, in
addition to  



 

59  taking into account all other Tax detriments, shall be entitled to include
the net present value of any lost depreciation or amortization or other
Tax detriment in a taxable year in which there is a reasonable likelihood
that such amount will be realized, using a discount rate of 10%.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 8.3(d)_ shall not apply to Losses
subject to indemnification under _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_ except as this _Section
8.3(d)_ relates to insurance proceeds actually received by the Seller
Indemnified Parties with respect to such Losses, it being understood that
Seller Indemnified Parties shall not have any obligation to seek such
insurance proceeds.



8.4  _Procedures_. The party or parties making a claim for indemnification
under this Agreement is, for purposes of this Agreement, referred to as the "
_Indemnified Party_ " and the party against whom such claims are
asserted under this _Article 8_ is, for the purposes of this Agreement,
referred to as the " _Indemnifying Party_ ". All claims by an Indemnified
Party under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows:



(a) In the event that (i) any claim for which an Indemnifying Party would
be liable to an Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to
be collected from such Indemnified Party by a third party (such claim, a "
_Third Party Claim_ ") or (ii) any Indemnified Party hereunder should have a
claim against any Indemnifying Party hereunder which does not involve a claim
being asserted against or sought to be collected from it by a third party
(such Claim, a " _Direct Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify in writing the Indemnifying Party of such claim, specifying the nature
of and the specific basis for such claim and the amount of all related Losses
that the Indemnified Party has incurred or reasonably believes in good faith
it will incur (a " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , the failure to
so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from
Liability under this _Article 8_ unless and to the extent it has been actually
prejudiced by such failure; and _provided_ , _further_ , that for the
avoidance of doubt, in the event that following the delivery of a Claim
Notice, the Indemnified Party has incurred or reasonably believes in good
faith it will incur an additional indemnifiable Loss with respect to the same
matter, such Indemnified Party may submit an additional Claim Notice covering
such additional Losses.



(b) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim by providing written notice to
the Indemnified Party and retaining counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party to represent the Indemnified Party and shall pay the fees
and disbursements of such counsel with regard thereto; _provided_ , _however,_
that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate fully in the
defense thereof (subject to the ultimate control of the Indemnifying Party)
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the Indemnifying Party (except that the Indemnifying Party shall be liable
for the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has
failed to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim within a reasonable
period of time after receipt of a written notice of such Third Party Claim);
_provided_ that in such case, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party
to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance
with this sentence, each of the Indemnified Party and its counsel, on the one
hand, and the Indemnifying Party and its counsel, on the other hand, shall
cooperate fully with the other in connection with such Third Party Claim
and the defense thereof (including, if applicable, in each case fulfilling
its obligations under _Section 5.25_ ) and keep the other fully informed of
all  



 

60  material matters relating to such Third Party Claim and the defense thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to employ one firm or separate counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees,
costs and expenses of such separate counsel, if (w) the use of counsel chosen
by the Indemnifying Party to represent the Indemnified Party would present
such counsel with a conflict of interest (based upon written advice of counsel
to the Indemnified Party), (x) the actual or potential defendants in, or
targets of, any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded
(based upon written advice of counsel to the Indemnified Party) that there may
be legal defenses available to it or other Indemnified Parties which are
different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, (y)
the Indemnifying Party elects not to retain counsel or assume control of such
defense, or (z) the Indemnifying Party shall authorize in writing the
Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party. Under no circumstances will the Indemnifying Party have
any liability in connection with any settlement, compromise or discharge that
is entered into without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).



(c) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not admit any Liability with
respect thereto or settle, compromise or discharge, any pending or threatened
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent (i) may be provided or withheld in the sole discretion of the
Indemnified Party if such Third Party Claim is a claim addressed by  _Section
8.4(f)_ and the proposed admission, settlement, compromise or discharge
involves Losses in excess of the Cap Amount and (ii) shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed in the case of other Third Party Claims); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that if the Indemnified Party does not give its consent to a
settlement approved by the Indemnifying Party which settlement provides for no
relief other than the payment of money damages, then in no event shall the
Indemnifying Party be liable for indemnification of Losses in excess of such
amount as would be payable pursuant to such settlement. If the Indemnifying
Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party
Claim which the Indemnifying Party shall recommend and which releases the
Indemnified Party completely and unconditionally from all Liability in
connection with such Third Party Claim. If the liability of the Indemnifying
Party with respect to a Third Party Claim is subject to the Basket Amount and
the Basket Amount has not yet been fully satisfied, the Indemnified Party
shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party, upon demand of the Indemnifying Party,
for any amount actually incurred by the Indemnifying Party in defending such
Third Party Claim up to the amount of the remaining Basket Amount.



(d) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice, at the reasonable request
of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant
the Indemnifying Party and its counsel, experts and Representatives full
access, during normal business hours, to the books, records, personnel and
properties of the Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the
Claim Notice at no cost to the Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses of the Indemnified Parties).



(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, if (i) the
Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim or
to retain counsel to  



 

61  represent the Indemnified Party within 30 days of receipt of a Claim Notice
or (ii) the Indemnifying Party does assume the defense of a Third Party Claim
but in bad faith fails to defend against the Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim and take such other action as it may elect
to defend such Third Party Claim as it may reasonably determine.



(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing and without
prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under _Sections 8.2_
and _8.3_ , in the event of a Third Party Claim that constitutes both (i) a
Retained Liability for which Parent and Purchasers could reasonably be
expected to be obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties under
_Section 8.3(a)(iv)_ and (ii) a Loss for which Holdings and the Sellers could
reasonably be expected to be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (taking into account, in each case, the
limitations on such obligations set forth in _Sections 8.2_ and _8.3_ ,
respectively), Holdings and the Sellers shall be considered the sole
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim solely for purposes
of determining the right to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim and
the other procedural aspects of _Section 8.4_.



8.5 _No Duplication; Exclusive Remedy_. __

 



(a) Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.



(b) Absent fraud or willful misconduct by an Indemnifying Party, the
indemnification provisions of this _Article 8_  shall be the exclusive
monetary or compensatory remedy of Sellers, Parent and Purchasers following
the Closing with respect to breaches of any representation, warranty,
covenant, obligation or other provision of this Agreement, and, except in
the case of fraud or willful misconduct by an Indemnifying Party, each
Indemnified Party expressly waives and relinquishes, on behalf of itself, its
successors and any assigns, any and all rights, claims or remedies such Person
may have other than under this _Article 8_ against any Indemnifying Party or
any Affiliate thereof (and any of their respective stockholders, officers,
directors, employees, agents or Representatives) with respect to monetary or
compensatory remedies of any kind. For the sake of clarification, nothing in
this _Section 8.5_ shall in any way limit or affect the ability of any Party
to seek specific performance of, or injunctive relief against, the breach (or
continued breach) of, any covenant, obligation or other provision of this
Agreement.



8.6  _Mitigation_. Parent and Purchasers, on the one hand, and Holdings and
Sellers, on the other hand, shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated
to indemnify another party under this _Article 8_ , including by making
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the applicable Losses, whether by
seeking claims against a third party, an insurer or otherwise, and to resolve
any such claim or liability;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be
obligated to mitigate in the event of fraud or intentional breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or other provision of this
Agreement by another Party.



8.7 _Off-set/Set-off_. Neither Parent or Purchasers nor Holdings or Sellers
shall have any right to off-set or set-off any payment due pursuant to
_Article 2_ or _Article 8_ of this  



 

62  Agreement against any other payment to be made pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise (including against any indemnification payments); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, without limiting any other right to remedies hereunder, (i)
Parent and Purchasers shall have the right in their sole discretion to set-off
any amount payable by Holdings and Sellers to Parent or Purchasers under
_Section 8.2_ against any amount that is or shall become payable by Parent or
Purchasers pursuant to _Article 2_ to the extent that the right of Parent or
Purchasers to receive such payment under _Section 8.2_ has been determined by
a final, non-appealable judgment or acknowledged and agreed to in writing by
Holdings and Sellers and (ii) Parent and Purchasers shall have the right to
set-off any amount payable by Holdings and Sellers to the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ against any amount that is or
becomes payable by Parent and Purchasers to the Seller Indemnified Parties
under _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_ or _Section 5.8(b)_ (solely to the extent related
to events and circumstances prior to the Closing) to the extent that the
right of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to receive such payments under
_Section 8.2(a)(i)_ has been determined by a final non-appealable judgment or
acknowledged and agreed to in writing by Holdings and Sellers.



8.8 _Subrogation_. After any indemnification payment is made to any
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article 8_ , the Indemnifying Party shall,
to extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights (if any) of Indemnified
Party against any third party in connection with the Losses to which such
payment relates. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence,
any Indemnified Party receiving an indemnification payment pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall execute, upon the written request of
the Indemnifying Party, any instrument reasonably necessary to evidence such
subrogation rights.



ARTICLE IX



TAXES



9.1 _Responsibility for Taxes_.



(a) Except as provided under _Section 9.2_ , Sellers shall be responsible for
any Taxes applicable to or in respect of the Acquired Assets or the Business
or any income in respect thereof attributable to all taxable periods ending on
or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date
for any taxable period that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date
(" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ").



(b) Parent shall be responsible for any Taxes applicable to or in respect of
the Acquired Assets or the Business or any income in respect
thereof attributable to all taxable periods (or any portion thereof) that
begins after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ that Parent shall in no
event be responsible for Taxes described in _Section 9.1(a)_ imposed on Parent
or Purchasers as a successor or transferee or for any Taxes described in
_Section 9.1(a)_ that result in a lien or other similar encumbrance on any
Acquired Asset including, as a result of the failure of the Parties to comply
with applicable bulk transfer laws.



(c) Any non-income Taxes in respect of the Acquired Assets or the Business
attributable to a taxable year or period beginning before and ending after the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") shall be the responsibility of (i)
Sellers for the period up to and including the  



 

63  Closing Date, and (ii) Parent for the period subsequent to the Closing Date.
Non-income Taxes allocable to a portion of a Straddle Period either
beginning before and ending on the Closing Date or beginning on the day
following the Closing Date shall be determined by multiplying the total amount
of non-income Taxes for the Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days of such portion of the Straddle Period, and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period.



(d) Sellers shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all Tax
Returns relating to the Acquired applicable to or in respect of the
Acquired Assets or the Business or any income in respect thereof attributable
to all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date. Any payment of
interest and penalties for late filing or payment of Taxes related to the
filing of such Tax Returns shall be wholly the responsibility of Seller.
Sellers shall file such Tax Returns consistent with past practice, except as
otherwise required by Law.



9.2 _Certain Other Taxes_.



(a) Notwithstanding _Section 9.1_ , all transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement, if any,
shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Parent and Purchasers and fifty percent
(50%) by Sellers when due, and Parent and Purchasers shall (i) file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any such
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and
fees and (ii) provide Sellers with a duly certified or authenticated copy of
an original receipt for the payment of each such Tax or fee and of each such
Tax return or other document filed.



(b) Sellers shall (i) promptly provide to Parent all information that is
reasonably requested by Parent to complete in a timely manner the appropriate
forms or that is otherwise required by Parent or Purchasers to apply for sales
tax exemptions for bulk, occasional or casual sales or any transfer or
similar Taxes described in _Section 9.2_ in any state in which any of the
Acquired Assets are located and (ii) otherwise assist Parent and Purchasers as
reasonably requested by Parent or Purchasers in applying for any such
exemptions.



9.3 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Sellers and Parent agree to treat
any indemnity payments made pursuant to _Article 8_ as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign income Tax purposes. If
treated otherwise under applicable law, payments shall be made in an amount
sufficient to indemnify the relevant Party on an after-Tax basis.



ARTICLE X



GENERAL PROVISIONS



10.1 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be
deemed to have been duly given upon receipt) by delivery in person, by

contemplated hereby (including fees and disbursements of attorneys,
accountants and financial advisors) and (ii) Holdings shall bear all of

10.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the Parties.

other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and
(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an

respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement shall not be
assigned by any Party, by operation of law or otherwise;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may assign any of its rights and obligations to any
controlled Affiliate of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent of
any of its obligations hereunder; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Holdings
or either Seller may at any time after the Closing, or from time to time after
the Closing, transfer, distribute or assign any or all of its rights,
interests or obligations, including its rights under this Agreement, to Knight
or any of its controlled Affiliates (and/or their respective successors and
assigns) in anticipation of, or in connection with, the dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up of such entity in which cases Holdings (if one of
the Sellers is the relevant party) or Knight (if Holdings is the relevant
party) shall be responsible for the performance of all of such entitys
rights, interests and obligations hereunder. Any attempted assignment which
does not comply with the provisions of this _Section 10.6_ shall be null and
void _ab initio_.



 

65 10.7 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each Party, and nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights,
benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Indemnified Party is an
intended third party beneficiary hereunder and shall be entitled to directly
enforce any indemnification rights that it may be entitled to hereunder.



10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without reference to
principles of conflicts of laws.



10.9 _Venue_. Any proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on
any right arising out of, this Agreement may only brought against any of the
Parties in the courts of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if it
has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, and each of the Parties consents to
the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in
any such action or proceeding and waives any objection to venue laid therein.



10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH A PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER AND (III) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN.



10.11  _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are
included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.



10.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by the different parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.



10.13 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Purchaser acknowledges that Sellers will not
comply with the provisions of any bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in
