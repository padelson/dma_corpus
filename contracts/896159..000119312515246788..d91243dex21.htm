accounts (including any shares of Company Common Stock held in a rabbi trust),
managed accounts, mutual funds or similar vehicles, or otherwise held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity (collectively, the " _Exception Shares_ ")),
shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Agreement, into the right to receive, (i) 0.6019 (the " _Per Share Exchange
Ratio_ ") common shares, par value CHF 24.15 per share, of Parent (the "
_Parent Common Shares_ ") (such number of shares, the " _Per Share Stock
Consideration_ ") and (ii) $62.93 in cash (the " _Per Share Cash
Consideration_ ") (the consideration described in clauses (i) and (ii), the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

(b) All the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_ shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old Certificate_
", _it_ _being_ _understood_ that any reference herein to an "Old Certificate"
shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating
to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) previously representing
any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional
shares that the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this
_Section 1.5_ and _Section 2.2_, without any interest thereon, and (iii) any
dividends or distributions that the holder thereof has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.2_. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding
Parent Common Shares shall have been increased, decreased, or changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities, in any such
case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in
capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend 

 



2  or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made
to the Per Share Exchange Ratio to give holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub (in each case other than the Exception Shares)
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and neither the Merger
Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

Stock granted by the Company under a Company Stock Plan (as defined below),
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") shall be converted
automatically into an option (an " _Adjusted Stock Option_ ") to purchase, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, modified as set forth in
_Section 1.7_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (including vesting terms),
the number of Parent Common Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares) equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Amount, which
Adjusted Stock Option shall have an exercise price per Parent Common Share
equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by
dividing (1) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock underlying
such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (2) the
Equity Award Conversion Amount; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the exercise
price and the number of Parent Common Shares underlying the Adjusted Stock
Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"); _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any Company Stock Option to
which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of
Parent Common Shares underlying the corresponding Adjusted Stock Option shall
be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as
are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the
Code. For purposes of this Agreement, (A) " _Company Stock Plans_ " means The
Chubb Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (2014), The Chubb Corporation Long-
Term Incentive Plan (2009), The Chubb Corporation Long-Term Stock Incentive

Directors (1996) and (B) " _Equity Award Conversion Amount_ " means (x) the
Per Share Stock Consideration plus (y) the quotient of (1) the Per Share Cash
Consideration divided by (2) the Parent Share Closing Price.

 



3 (b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan and each
performance unit award in respect of shares of Company Common Stock granted
under a Company Stock Plan, in each case, that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Restricted Stock Unit Award_
") shall be converted automatically into a restricted stock unit award or
performance unit award (each, an " _Adjusted Restricted Stock Unit Award_ ")
with the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company
Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, modified
as set forth in _Section 1.7_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (including
time-based vesting terms but excluding performance-based vesting terms), and
relating to the number of Parent Common Shares equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted
Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (determined, with
respect to any Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards subject to performance-
based vesting terms, based on (A) with respect to the performance period
ending in calendar year 2015, the greater of target or actual performance
(determined as set forth in _Section 5.2_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule), and (B) with respect to the performance periods ending after 2015,
target performance), multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Amount,
with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole number of shares. Any
accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents with respect to any Company Restricted
Stock Unit Award will be assumed and become an obligation with respect to
the applicable Adjusted Restricted Stock Unit Award.

(c) Each deferred stock unit award in respect of shares of Company Common
Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Deferred Stock Unit
Award_ " and, together with the Company Stock Options and the Company
Restricted Stock Unit Awards, the " _Company Equity Awards_ "), shall, as of
the Effective Time, be converted automatically into a deferred stock unit
award (an " _Adjusted Deferred Stock Unit Award_ ") with the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Company Deferred Stock Unit Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including settlement terms), and
relating to the number of Parent Common Shares equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Deferred
Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii)
the Equity Award Conversion Amount, with any fractional shares rounded to the
nearest whole number of shares. Any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents
with respect to any Company Deferred Stock Unit Award will be assumed and
become an obligation with respect to the applicable Adjusted Deferred Stock
Unit Award. Following the Effective Time, the Company Common Stock fund shall
be replaced with a Parent Common Share fund, and participants shall be able to
allocate their investments in the Parent Common Share fund or in other
investment options under the Defined Contribution Excess Benefit Plan of The
Chubb Corporation, effective January 1, 2008 (the " _Company Excess Plan_ ")
at their election in accordance with the terms of the Company Excess Plan as
in effect from time to time.

 

(d) Each (i) share of Company Common Stock in respect of a deferred unit
obligation under (A) The Chubb Corporation Key Employee Deferred Compensation
Plan (2005) or (B) The Chubb Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for
Directors, in each case, as amended or restated (collectively, the " _Company
Deferred Compensation Plans_ ") or (C) the Company Excess Plan (such deferred
unit obligations, the " _Company Deferred Share Units_ ") that is unsettled as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) obligation to pay cash 

 



4  measured based on the value of the Company Common Stock under (A) the CCAP
SERP (as defined in _Section 1.7(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule), or

Plans_ " and, together with the Company Deferred Compensation Plans, the "
_Company Non-Qualified Plans_ ") (such obligations, the " _Company Deferred
Cash-Settled Units_ " and, together with the Company Deferred Share Units,
the " _Company Deferred Units_ "), shall be deemed to be invested in Parent
Common Shares, with the number of Parent Common Shares subject to such Company
Deferred Units in a participants account under each Company Non-Qualified
Plan as of the Effective Time to be equal to the product of (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Deferred Units as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Equity Award
Conversion Amount, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole
number of shares. Any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents with respect to
any Company Deferred Units will be assumed and become an obligation with
respect to the applicable adjusted Company Deferred Units. Following the
Effective Time, the Company Common Stock fund shall be replaced with a Parent
Common Share fund, and participants shall be able to allocate their
investments in the Parent Common Share fund or in other investment options
under the applicable Company Non-Qualified Plans (or in the case of the CCAP
SERP, the Company Excess Plan) at their election in accordance with the terms
of the Company Non-Qualified Plans as in effect from time to time.

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company and its Organization and Compensation Committee, as applicable,
shall adopt any resolutions that are necessary to (i) effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 1.7_ (including determining that the Adjusted
Stock Options, Adjusted Restricted Stock Unit Awards, and Adjusted Deferred
Stock Unit Awards are "Alternative Awards" contemplated by the Company Stock
Plans) and (ii) ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Company
Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any person pursuant to
or in settlement of the Company Equity Awards.

 

(f) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are
necessary for the conversion of the Company Equity Awards and Company
Deferred Units, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 1.7_, including the
assumption of the applicable Company Stock Plans and Company Non-Qualified
Plans, and the reservation, issuance, and listing of Parent Common Shares as
is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this _Section
1.7_. No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and have on file
with the SEC an effective registration statement on an appropriate form
(including Form S-8, Form S-3, or other applicable form) with respect to the
Parent Common Shares subject to the Adjusted Stock Options, Adjusted
Restricted Stock Unit Awards, and Adjusted Deferred Stock Unit Awards, and
with respect to the Parent Common Shares subject to the Company Deferred
Units, and shall distribute a prospectus relating to such form (including Form
S-8, Form S-3, or other applicable form), and Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement for so long as such Adjusted Stock Options,
Adjusted Restricted Stock Unit Awards, or Adjusted Deferred Stock Unit Awards,
and Company Deferred Units remain outstanding.

 

1.8 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.
(a) The certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and
restated at the

 



5  Effective Time to read in its entirety as set forth in the form of _Exhibit

1.9 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The Board of Directors of Merger
Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation

the Surviving Corporation By-Laws.

ARTICLE II

 

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

2.1 _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "),
for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for exchange in accordance
with this _Article II_ , (a) certificates, or at Parents option, evidence of
shares in book-entry form, representing the Parent Common Shares (" _New
Certificates_ "), to be given to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant
to _Section 1.5_ and this _Article II_ in exchange for outstanding shares of
such Company Common Stock, and (b) cash in an amount sufficient to allow the
Exchange Agent to make all payments required pursuant to this _Article II_
(such New Certificates and cash, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
"). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent, _provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon
shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Old
Certificates. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent or Merger Sub, or as otherwise directed by Parent.

2.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of
record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Article I_ , a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for the
consideration for certificates representing the number of whole Parent Common
Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and the cash portion of the
Merger Consideration which shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been converted into the right
to receive pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any dividends or

 



6  distributions to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_. From and after the
Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old
Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such properly completed letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder
of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that
number of whole Parent Common Shares to which such holder of Company Common
Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of _Article I_ and
(ii) a check representing the amount of (A) the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_ , (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder
has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates
surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ and (C) any
dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to this _Section 2.2_, and the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued with respect to any property to be delivered upon surrender of
Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_,
each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or
distributions as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent
Common Shares shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate
until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance
with this _Article II_. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in
accordance with this _Article II_ , the record holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable after the
Effective Time with respect to the whole Parent Common Shares which the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been
converted into the right to receive.

 

(c) If any New Certificate representing Parent Common Shares is to be issued
in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance
any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
New Certificate representing Parent Common Shares in any name other than that
of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent Common Shares shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Parent Common Shares shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share, and such fractional

 



7  share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company
who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average
of the closing price of the Parent Common Shares on the NYSE as reported by
_The Wall Street Journal_ for the five full trading days ending on the day
preceding the Closing Date (the " _Parent Share Closing Price_ ") by (ii) the
fraction of a Parent Common Share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when
expressed in decimal form) to which such holder would otherwise be entitled
(after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock owned by such
holder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time).

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of the Company
who have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and
any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Shares deliverable
in respect of each former share of Company Common Stock such shareholders hold
as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable
to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

 

(g) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Merger Sub
or Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the cash portion of the
aggregate Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common
Shares, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this _Section
2.2_ or any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Company Common Stock, such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be.

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends
or distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



8 ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub prior to the execution hereof (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ "), _provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be
set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would
not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
incorrect, (b) the mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission by the Company that such item represents a material exception
or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (c) any disclosures made with
respect to a section of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to qualify (1) any
other section of this _Article III_ specifically referenced or cross-
referenced and (2) other sections of this _Article III_ to the extent it is
reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific
cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure
applies to such other sections; or (ii) as disclosed in any Company SEC
Reports filed prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor
disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of
risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other
statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature), the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of New Jersey. The Company has the
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to
Parent, the Company or Merger Sub, as the case may be, a material adverse
effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of
operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i),
Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A)
changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") or SAP (or local equivalents in the
applicable jurisdiction) prescribed by the applicable insurance regulatory
authority, including accounting and financial reporting pronouncements by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, (B)
changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general
applicability to companies in the industries in which such party and its
Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental
Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national, regional or
local political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of
terrorism) or in economic or market conditions affecting the insurance
industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its
Subsidiaries, (D) changes, circumstances or events, in

 



9  each case after the date hereof, resulting in liabilities under insurance
agreements to which such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
including any effects resulting from any earthquake, hurricane, tornado,
windstorm, rain, flood or other natural disaster, (E) failure, in and of
itself, to meet earnings projections or internal financial forecasts, but not
including the underlying causes thereof, (F) changes attributable to the
announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby or to actions expressly
required by this Agreement in contemplation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or (G) actions or omissions taken pursuant to the written consent of
Parent, in the case of the Company, or the Company, in the case of Parent or
Merger Sub; except, with respect to subclause (A), (B), (C) or (D), to the
extent that the effects of such change are materially disproportionately
adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of
operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, as compared to other companies in the industry in the same or similar
geographic regions in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate or
underwrite insurance) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word "
_Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any party, means any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, insurance company or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which at least a
majority of the securities or ownership interests having by their terms
ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or other
persons performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by such party and/or by one or more of its Subsidiaries. True and
complete copies of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company,
as amended (the " _Company Certificate_ "), and the bylaws of the Company, as
amended (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, have previously been made available by the Company to Parent.

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified and, where applicable, in good standing
would reasonably be likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (iii) has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of
any Company Subsidiary to pay dividends or distributions except as required by
applicable law and, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity,
for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all
such regulated entities. _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all Company Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof and a description of their jurisdiction of formation and
ownership of their capital stock.

(c) The Company conducts its insurance operations solely through the
Subsidiaries set forth in _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the " _Company Insurance Subsidiaries_ "). Each of the Company
Insurance Subsidiaries is (i) duly licensed or authorized as an insurance
company and, where applicable, a reinsurer in its jurisdiction of
incorporation, (ii) duly licensed or authorized as an insurance company and,
where applicable, a reinsurer in each other jurisdiction where it is required
to be so licensed or authorized, and (iii) duly authorized in its jurisdiction
of incorporation and each other applicable jurisdiction to write each line of
business reported as being written in the Company SAP 

 



10  Statements. No Governmental Entity regulating the business of insurance or
reinsurance under Insurance Laws (an " _Insurance Regulator_ ") has notified
the Company or any Company Insurance Subsidiary in writing or, to the
knowledge of the Company, orally that any Company Insurance Subsidiary is
commercially domiciled in any jurisdiction. As used in this Agreement, "
_Insurance Laws_ " means any law, statute, code or ordinance, or any rule,
regulation, agency requirement or interpretation of any Governmental Entity
applicable to the business of insurance or reinsurance, or the regulation of
insurance or reinsurance companies, whether domestic or foreign, and all
applicable orders or directives of Insurance Regulators (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Lloyds Regulations and the handbooks of the U.K.
Financial Conduct Authority and the U.K. Prudential Regulation
Authority, respectively).

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 1,200,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, and 8,000,000

pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification,
prior to the Closing Date.

compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2005-1 and (ii) since
January 1, 2009, been in documentary and operational compliance with Section
409A of the Code, except, in each case as would not reasonably be expected to
result in, either individually or in the aggregate, any material liability to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



20 (f) With respect to each U.S. Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV
or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code: (i) based
upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the actuarial
report prepared by such U.S. Company Benefit Plans actuary for funding
purposes as of January 1, 2014, with respect to such U.S. Company Benefit
Plan, no such plan is in "at-risk" status for purposes of Section 430 of the
Code, (ii) except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material
liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the present
value of accrued benefits under each such U.S. Company Benefit Plan, based
upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the actuarial
report prepared by such U.S. Company Benefit Plans actuary for funding
purposes as of January 1, 2014, with respect to such U.S. Company Benefit
Plan, did not, as of its latest valuation date, exceed the then current fair
market value of the assets of such U.S. Company Benefit Plan allocable to

expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (vi)
the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such U.S. Company
Benefit Plan.

(g) None of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any other entity
which, together with the Company, would be deemed a "single employer" within
the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA (a " _Company ERISA Affiliate_ ") has, at
any time during the last six (6) years, contributed to or been obligated to
contribute to any plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a plan that has
two (2) or more contributing sponsors at least two (2) of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple
Employer Plan_ "), and, during the six (6) years prior to the date hereof,
none of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, any Company ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability to a
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a complete or
partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan that
has not been satisfied in full.

 

(h) No U.S. Company Benefit Plan provides for post-retirement health or
medical or life insurance benefits for retired or former employees
or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B
of the Code. The most recent plan document or summary plan description for
each U.S. Company Benefit Plan that provides post-retirement health, medical,
life insurance or other welfare benefits to any employee or former employee
reserves the right for the Company or the applicable Subsidiary to amend,
terminate or modify such plan at any time.

the prior three (3) years through the date hereof, have been timely made or
paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before
the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and records of the
Company.

 



21 (j) There are no pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened material
claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to the Companys
knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that would reasonably be expected to
give rise to a material claim or lawsuit, against the U.S. Company Benefit
Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the U.S.
Company Benefit Plans and for whom the Company has an obligation to indemnify
or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the U.S. Company Benefit
Plans.

(k) None of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any Company ERISA Affiliate
nor, to the Companys knowledge, any other person, including any fiduciary
whom the Company has an obligation to indemnify, has engaged in any
"prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section
406 of ERISA), which would reasonably be expected to subject any of the U.S.
Company Benefit Plans or their related trusts, the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any Company ERISA Affiliate or any person that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any tax or penalty
imposed under Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code or Section 409 or 502 of ERISA
that would result in material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

 

(l) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) (i) result in, cause an acceleration of the vesting,
exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer, director or
independent contractor (who is a natural person) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under a U.S. Company Benefit Plan or, to the Companys knowledge,
a Foreign Company Benefit Plan or (ii) result in any limitation on the right
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or
receive a reversion of assets from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust
under a U.S. Company Benefit Plan or, to the Companys knowledge, a Foreign
Company Benefit Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of
benefits) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a
result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to a
rabbi trust or similar funding vehicle, and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not cause or require the Company or any of its affiliates
to establish or make any contribution to a rabbi trust or similar funding
vehicle.

(m) No Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code, or otherwise.

(n) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability
to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, each Foreign Company
Benefit Plan (i) if intended to qualify for special tax treatment, meets all
the requirements for such treatment, (ii) if required, to any extent, to be
funded, book-reserved or secured by an insurance policy, is fully funded,
book-reserved or secured by an insurance policy, as applicable, based on
reasonable actuarial assumptions in accordance with applicable accounting

are in compliance with, their terms, all applicable laws, government taxation

labor organization in all material respects. As of the date hereof, there is
no pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened material litigation
relating to any Foreign Company Benefit Plan.

 

(o) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability
to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, there are no pending
or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened labor grievances or material unfair
labor practice claims or charges against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor disputes against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any collective bargaining or similar
agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices agreed to
with any labor organization or Governmental Entity applicable to employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the United States, and to the
Companys knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or bound to any such arrangements described in this sentence outside of
the United States. To the Companys knowledge, there are no organizing efforts
by any union or other labor organization seeking to represent any employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

23 (b) Since January 1, 2012, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,

and its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and
maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable
assurances regarding compliance by the Company and its Subsidiaries with all
applicable Anti-Corruption Laws.

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries are, and since January 1, 2012 have been,
conducting operations at all times in compliance in all material respects

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is currently the subject or the
target of any economic sanctions administered or enforced by any Governmental
Entity (collectively, " _Sanctions_ "), nor is the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries located, organized or resident in a country or territory that is

engaged in, are not now knowingly engaged in and will not engage in, any
dealings or transactions with any person that at the time of the dealing or

Company Disclosure Schedule, is referred to herein as a " _Company Contract_
," and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has
received written notice of, any violation of a Company Contract by any of the
other parties thereto which would reasonably be expected to be, either
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(b) In each case, except as would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company: (i) each Company Contract is valid and binding on the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and the applicable counterparty or
counterparties and is in full force and effect, (ii) the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries has performed all obligations required to be performed by it

its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or

or has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or since January 1,
2012, has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request
or suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity, specific
to the Company or its Subsidiaries, that, in each of any such cases, currently
restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or that in any
material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay
dividends, its risk management policies, its management or its business (each,
whether or not set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, a " _Company
Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries been
advised in writing or, to the Companys knowledge, orally, since January 1,
2012, by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is
considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such Company
Regulatory Agreement.

3.15 _Derivatives_. All swaps, caps, floors, option agreements, futures and
forward contracts and other similar derivative transactions and risk
management arrangements (" _Derivative Contracts_ ") entered into for the
account of or guaranteed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries were
entered into in the ordinary course of business and in accordance in all
material respects with applicable rules, regulations and policies of any
Regulatory Agency with jurisdiction over the Company or any such Subsidiary
and with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time
and are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions). The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material respects all their material
obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have
accrued, and, to the Companys knowledge, there are no material breaches,
violations or defaults or _bona fide_ allegations or assertions of such by
any party thereunder. The financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis under or with respect to each such
Derivative Contract has been reflected in its books and records and the books
and records of such Subsidiaries, in each case, in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied.

 



26 3.16 _Environmental Matters_. Except as would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and since January
1, 2012, have complied, with any federal, state, local or foreign law,
regulation, order, decree, permit, authorization, common law or legal
requirement relating to: (i) the protection or restoration of the environment,
health and safety as it relates to hazardous substance exposure or natural
resource damages, (ii) the handling, use, presence, disposal, release or
threatened release of, or exposure to, any hazardous substance, or (iii)
noise, odor, wetlands, indoor air, pollution, contamination or any injury to
persons or property from exposure to any hazardous substance (collectively, "
_Environmental Laws_ ") and have not incurred any liabilities under
Environmental Laws. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened legal, administrative, arbitral or other judicial proceedings,
claims or actions, or, to the knowledge of the Company, any private
environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental
investigations of any nature, in each case, seeking to impose on the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or that could reasonably be likely to result in
the imposition on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of, any material
liability or obligation arising under any Environmental Law. To the knowledge
of the Company, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim,
action or governmental investigation that would impose any material liability
or obligation. The Company is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment,
decree, letter agreement or memorandum of agreement by or with any court,
Governmental Entity, Regulatory Agency or third party imposing any liability
or obligation with respect to any Environmental Law, except for any such
agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter agreement or memorandum of
agreement that would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

3.17 _Insurance Maintained by the Company_. The Company and its Subsidiaries
are insured with reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts as
the management of the Company reasonably has determined to be prudent and
consistent with industry practice, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received notice to the effect that any of them are in
default under any material insurance policy. Each such policy is outstanding
and in full force and effect and, except for policies insuring against
potential liabilities of officers, directors and employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, the Company or the relevant Subsidiary thereof is the sole
beneficiary of such policies. All premiums and other payments due under any
such policy have been paid, and all claims thereunder have been filed in due
and timely fashion, with such exceptions that would not, either individually
or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

3.18 _Investment Assets_.

(a) All securities and investment assets, including bonds, notes, debentures,
mortgage loans, real estate and all other instruments of indebtedness,
stocks, partnerships, joint venture interests and all other equity interests,
certificates issued by or interests in trusts and Derivatives held for
investment (collectively, the " _Investment Assets_ ") and carried on the
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2015
complied in all material

 



27  respects with the Companys investment guidelines and in all material
respects with all applicable Insurance Laws. As of the date hereof, there has
been no material change in the overall composition of the Investment Assets
held by the Company and its Subsidiaries since March 31, 2015. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, has good and marketable title to
all of the Investment Assets it purports to own, free and clear of all Liens
other than Liens created or incurred in the ordinary course of the Companys
or any of its Subsidiaries investment operations consistent with past
practice. The Investment Assets held by each Company Insurance Subsidiary
that are included as admitted assets in any such Company Insurance
Subsidiarys statutory financial statements as of March 31, 2015 were
qualified or eligible to be admitted assets of such Company Insurance
Subsidiary under applicable Insurance Laws.

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries employ, to the extent applicable,
investment, securities, risk management and other policies, practices and
procedures that the Company believes are prudent and reasonable in the context
of their respective businesses, and the Company and its Subsidiaries have,
since January 1, 2012, been in compliance with such policies, practices and
procedures in all material respects.

3.19 _Insurance Matters_.

 

(a) To the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2012, at the time each
agent, representative, producer, reinsurance intermediary, wholesaler, third-
party administrator, distributor, broker, employee or other person authorized
to sell, produce, manage or administer products on behalf of any Company
Insurance Subsidiary (" _Agent_ ") wrote, sold, produced, managed,
administered or procured business for a Company Insurance Subsidiary, except
as would not be material to the Company, such Agent was, at the time the Agent
wrote or sold business, duly licensed for the type of activity and business
written, sold, produced, managed, administered or produced. Each of the
contracts, agreements or arrangements between a Company Insurance Subsidiary
and any Agent who has sold, underwritten, produced, managed, administered or
issued business for or on behalf of such Company Insurance Subsidiary is,
except as would not be material to the Company, valid, binding and in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms. As of the date of this
Agreement, no Agent individually accounting for 5% or more of the total gross
GAAP premiums of all Company Insurance Subsidiaries for the year ended
December 31, 2014 has indicated to the Company or any Company Insurance
Subsidiary in writing or, to the knowledge of the Company, orally that such
Agent will be unable or unwilling to continue its relationship as an Agent
with any Company Insurance Subsidiary within twelve (12) months after the date
of this Agreement. To the knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this
Agreement, no Agent has been since January 1, 2012, or is currently, in
violation (or with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would be in
violation), in any material respect, of any term or provision of any law, rule
or regulation applicable to such Agents writing, sale, management,
administration or production of insurance or other business for any Company
Insurance Subsidiary, that is reasonably likely to be material to the Company.
To the knowledge of the Company, each Agent was appointed by the Company or a
Company Insurance Subsidiary in compliance in all material respects with
applicable Insurance Laws and all processes and procedures undertaken with
respect to such Agent were undertaken in compliance, in all
material respects, with applicable Insurance Laws.

 



28 (b) The Company has made available to Parent a true and complete copy of any
material internal actuarial reports prepared by actuaries with respect to any
Company Insurance Subsidiary since January 1, 2014, and all attachments,
addenda, supplements and modifications thereto (the " _Company Actuarial
Analyses_ "). To the knowledge of the Company, each Company Actuarial
Analysis was based, in all material respects, upon an accurate inventory of
policies relevant to such Company Actuarial Analysis in force for the Company
Insurance Subsidiaries at the relevant time of preparation. The information
and data furnished by the Company and the Company Insurance Subsidiaries to
their respective actuaries in connection with the preparation of the Company
Actuarial Analyses were (i) obtained from the books and records of the
relevant Company Insurance Subsidiary and (ii) accurate in all material
respects for the periods covered in such reports.

 

(c) Since January 1, 2012, the Company and the Company Insurance Subsidiaries
have made all required notices, submissions, reports or other filings under
applicable insurance holding company statutes, and all contracts, agreements,
arrangements and transactions in effect between any Company Insurance
Subsidiary and any affiliate are in compliance in all material respects with
the requirements of all applicable insurance holding company statutes, except
where the failure to make any such notices, submissions, reports, or other
filings, or any non-compliance with such statutes, would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

3.20 _Reinsurance and Coinsurance_.

 

(a) To the knowledge of the Company, all reinsurance or coinsurance, ceded or
assumed, treaties or agreements, including retrocessional agreements, under
which any Company Insurance Subsidiary has any existing rights, obligations or
liabilities (including all amendments, extensions, renewals, guaranties,
modifications, waivers, supplements and other agreements, if any,
related thereto, " _Reinsurance Agreements_ ") are, as of the date of this
Agreement, in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full
force and effect would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, any other party to a Reinsurance Agreement, is in breach of or
in default under any Reinsurance Agreement, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, no event has occurred which, with the passage of time or the giving
of notice, or both, would constitute a default thereunder by the Company or
the Company Subsidiary party thereto or by any other party thereto, except for
such breaches and defaults as would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not violate, or result in a right to
terminate, recapture, rescind or modify, any Reinsurance Agreement or any
coverage provided by any party thereto, except as would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

(c) In those instances in which a Company Insurance Subsidiary is a cedent,
neither the Company nor such Company Insurance Subsidiary has received any
written notice

 



29  that the financial condition of any other party to any Reinsurance Agreement
is impaired with the result that a default thereunder may be reasonably
anticipated, except in those instances in which such default would not,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
no counterparty to a Reinsurance Agreement is insolvent or the subject of a
rehabilitation, liquidation, receivership or similar proceeding.

(d) Each Reinsurance Agreement is (assuming due power and authority of, and
due execution and delivery by, the other party or parties thereto) valid and
binding upon the Company or the Company Insurance Subsidiary party thereto
and, to the knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto (except as may
be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions), except for such failures to be

Merger Sub to the Company prior to the execution hereof (the " _Parent
Disclosure Schedule_ "), _provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be
set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would
not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
incorrect, (b) the mere inclusion of an item in the Parent Disclosure Schedule
as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an
admission by Parent or Merger Sub that such item represents a material
exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Merger Sub, and (c) any
disclosures made with respect to a section of this  _Article IV_ shall be
deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this _Article IV_ specifically
referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of this _Article IV_ to
the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence
of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such other sections; or (ii) as disclosed in any Parent
SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor
disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of
risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other

forward-looking in nature), Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant
to the Company as follows:

(a) Parent has been duly created for an unlimited duration and is validly
existing as a company limited by shares (Aktiengesellschaft) under the laws
of Switzerland. Parent has the corporate power and authority to own or lease
all of its properties and assets and

 



35  to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Parent is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. True and complete
copies of Parents Articles of Association and Organizational Regulations, as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made
available by Parent to the Company.

(b) Each Subsidiary of Parent (a " _Parent Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified and, where applicable, in good standing
would reasonably be likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and (iii) has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of
any Subsidiary of Parent to pay dividends or distributions except as required
by applicable law and, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity,

reinsurer in each other jurisdiction where it is required to be so licensed or
authorized, and (iii) duly authorized in its jurisdiction of incorporation and
each other applicable jurisdiction to write each line of business reported as
being written in the Parent SAP Statements, except where the failure to be so
licensed or authorized would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

Report, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date
of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier
date. As of their respective dates, all Parent SEC Reports filed or furnished
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto. As of the date

 



39  of this Agreement, no executive officer of Parent has failed in any respect
to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding comments from, or material unresolved issues raised by, the SEC
with respect to any of the Parent SEC Reports.

 

4.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated financial position of
Parent and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited
statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii)
complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied during the periods involved,
except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto.
The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, since January
1, 2012, and are being maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP, and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not resigned (or informed Parent that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Parent as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Parent on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(b) None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries has any
liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for (i) those liabilities
that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of
Parent included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
March 31, 2015 (including any notes thereto), (ii) liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since March 31, 2015
or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
or (iii) liabilities that are not material to Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent (i) has implemented
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to
Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within those
entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has disclosed,

 



40  based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parents
outside auditors and the Audit Committee of Parents Board of Directors (x)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely affect
Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (y) to the knowledge of Parent, any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal control over financial reporting. Copies of any
such disclosures were made in writing by management to Parents auditors and
Audit Committee and a copy has previously been made available to the Company.
To the knowledge of Parent, there is no reason to believe that Parents
outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant
to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, without qualification, prior to the Closing Date.

(d) Since January 1, 2012, (i) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director,
officer, auditor, accountant or representative of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained
knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether
written or, to the knowledge of Parent, oral, regarding the accounting,
auditing or actuarial practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to reserves) of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or written claim that
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting, auditing or actuarial practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
whether or not employed by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective officers, directors or employees to the Board
of Directors of either Parent or Merger Sub or any committee thereof or to
the knowledge of Parent, to any director or officer of Parent or Merger Sub.

the Insurance Regulator of the jurisdiction in which the applicable Parent
Insurance Subsidiary is domiciled or commercially domiciled (collectively,

Subsidiaries, were prepared in all material respects in conformity with SAP
applied on a consistent basis and present fairly, in all material respects,
to the extent required by and in conformity with SAP, the statutory financial
condition of such Parent Insurance Subsidiary at the respective dates and the
results of operations, changes in statutory capital and surplus and cash flow
of such Parent Insurance Subsidiary for each of the periods then ended. The
Parent SAP Statements were filed with the applicable Insurance Regulator in a
timely fashion on forms prescribed or permitted by such Insurance Regulator.
No deficiencies or violations material to the financial condition of any of
the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries, either individually or in the aggregate,
have been asserted in writing by any Insurance Regulator that have not been
cured or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of such Insurance Regulator.
The quarterly and annual statements of each Parent Insurance Subsidiary filed
on or after the date of this Agreement and

 



41  prior to the Closing, when filed with the applicable Insurance Regulators of
the applicable jurisdictions, will present fairly in all material respects, to
the extent required by and in conformity with SAP, the statutory financial
condition of such Parent Insurance Subsidiary at the respective dates
indicated and the results of operations, changes in capital and surplus and
cash flow of such Parent Insurance Subsidiary for each of the periods therein
specified (subject to normal year-end adjustments) and will be filed in a
timely fashion on forms prescribed or permitted by the relevant Insurance
Regulator. Since the year ended December 31, 2013, the annual consolidated
balance sheets (statutory basis) and consolidated statements of operations
(statutory basis) included in the Parent SAP Statements have been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

 

(f) The reserves for claims, losses (including incurred but not reported
losses) and loss adjustment expenses (whether allocated or unallocated), as
reflected in each of the Parent SEC Reports and Parent SAP Statements, (i)
were established at levels consistent in all material respects with generally
accepted actuarial standards consistently applied and fairly stated
in accordance with sound actuarial principles, (ii) were computed on the
basis of methodologies consistent in all material respects with those used in
computing the corresponding reserves in the prior fiscal years, and (iii) were
in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of all
applicable Insurance Laws with respect to the establishment of reserves. The
provision for uncollectible reinsurance as reflected in each of the Parent SEC
Reports (x) was computed on the basis of methodologies consistent in all
material respects with those used in computing the corresponding provisions in
the prior fiscal years, and (y) was established in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP.

 

4.7 _Broker s Fees_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers or directors, have
employed any broker, finder or financial advisor, or incurred any liability

connection with the Merger or related transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, other than Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC (" _Morgan Stanley_ ").

conducted in violation of any federal, state, local or foreign law, or any

Parent and except as would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, its Agents
have marketed, sold and issued insurance products in compliance in all
material respects with Insurance Laws applicable to the business of such

Parent Insurance Subsidiaries have not received, since January 1, 2012, any
written notice or communication of any instance of non-compliance with any
such law, or any rule, regulation, agency requirement or published
interpretation of any Governmental Entity that has not been cured as of the

aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent,
each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has obtained and is in compliance with all
Licenses necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted (and has
paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith).

(b) Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries are, and since
January 1, 2012 have been, conducting operations at all times in compliance
in all material respects with applicable Anti-Money Laundering Laws, Anti-
Corruption Laws and Sanctions.

4.12  _Certain Contracts_.

(a) Each contract, agreement, arrangement, commitment or understanding
(whether written or oral) that is a "material contract" (as such term is
defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound as of the date hereof has been filed as an exhibit to
the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by Parent, or a Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K subsequent thereto (each, a
" _Parent Contract_ "), and, to the knowledge of Parent, there has been no
violation of any Parent Contract by any of the other parties thereto that
would reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

(b) In each case, except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (i)
each Parent Contract is valid and binding on Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and the applicable counterparty or counterparties
and is in full force and effect, (ii) Parent or, as applicable, each of
its Subsidiaries has performed all obligations required to be performed by it
prior to the date hereof under each Parent Contract, (iii) to Parents
knowledge, each third-party counterparty to each Parent Contract has performed
all obligations required to be performed by it prior to the date hereof under
such Parent Contract and (iv) no event or condition exists which constitutes
or, after notice or lapse of time, or both, will constitute, a default on the
part of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under any such Parent Contract.

 



44 4.13 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement
action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or since January 1, 2012, has
adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or
suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity, specific to
Parent or its Subsidiaries, that, in each of any such cases, currently
restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or that in any
material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to
pay dividends, its risk management policies, its management or its business
(each, whether or not set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, a " _Parent
Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Parent or any of its Subsidiaries been
advised in writing or, to Parents knowledge, orally, since January 1, 2012,
by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is considering
issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting any such Parent Regulatory
Agreement.

 

4.14 _Environmental Matters_. Except as would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent, Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and since January 1,
2012, have complied, with any Environmental Laws and have not incurred any
liabilities under Environmental Laws. There are no pending or, to
the knowledge of Parent, threatened legal, administrative, arbitral or other
judicial proceedings, claims or actions, or, to the knowledge of Parent, any
private environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental
investigations of any nature, in each case, seeking to impose on Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, or that could reasonably be likely to result in the
imposition on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of, any material liability or
obligation arising under any Environmental Law. To the knowledge of Parent,
there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or
governmental investigation that would impose any material liability or
obligation. Parent is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree,
letter agreement or memorandum of agreement by or with any court, Governmental
Entity, Regulatory Agency or third party imposing any liability or obligation
with respect to any Environmental Law, except for any such agreement, order,
judgment, decree, letter agreement or memorandum of agreement that would not,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

4.15 _Insurance Maintained by Parent_. Parent and its Subsidiaries are insured
with reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts as the
management of Parent reasonably has determined to be prudent and consistent
with industry practice, and neither Parent

 



45  nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice to the effect that any of
them are in default under any material insurance policy. Each such policy is
outstanding and in full force and effect and, except for policies insuring
against potential liabilities of officers, directors and employees of Parent
and its Subsidiaries, Parent or the relevant Subsidiary thereof is the sole
beneficiary of such policies. All premiums and other payments due under any
such policy have been paid, and all claims thereunder have been filed in due
and timely fashion, with such exceptions that would not, either individually
or in the aggregate, be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

4.16 _Derivatives_. All Derivative Contracts entered into for the account of
or guaranteed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries were entered into in the
ordinary course of business and in accordance in all material respects with
applicable rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory Agency with
jurisdiction over Parent or any such Subsidiary and with counterparties
believed to be financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and
binding obligations of Parent or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable in
accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by the
Enforceability Exceptions). Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have duly
performed in all material respects all their material obligations thereunder
to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and, to Parents
knowledge, there are no material breaches, violations or defaults or _bona
fide_ allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder. The financial
position of Parent and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis under or with
respect to each such Derivative Contract has been reflected in its books and
records and the books and records of such Subsidiaries, in each case, in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied.

 

4.17 _Insurance Matters_.

 

(a) To the knowledge of Parent, since January 1, 2012, at the time each agent,
representative, producer, reinsurance intermediary, wholesaler, third-party
administrator, distributor, broker, employee or other person authorized to
sell, produce, manage or administer products on behalf of any Parent Insurance
Subsidiary (" _Parent Agent_ ") wrote, sold, produced, managed, administered
or procured business for a Parent Insurance Subsidiary, except as would not be
material to Parent, such Parent Agent was, at the time the Parent Agent wrote
or sold business, duly licensed for the type of activity and business
written, sold, produced, managed, administered or produced. Each of the
contracts, agreements or arrangements between a Parent Insurance Subsidiary
and any Parent Agent who has sold, underwritten, produced, managed,
administered or issued business for or on behalf of such Parent Insurance
Subsidiary is, except as would not be material to Parent, valid, binding and
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. As of the date of this
Agreement, no Parent Agent individually accounting for 5% or more of the
total gross GAAP premiums of all Parent Insurance Subsidiaries for the year
ended December 31, 2014 has indicated to Parent or any Parent Insurance
Subsidiary in writing that such Parent Agent will be unable or unwilling to
continue its relationship as a Parent Agent with any Parent Insurance
Subsidiary within twelve (12) months after the date of this Agreement. To the
knowledge of Parent, as of the date of this Agreement, no Parent Agent has
been since January 1, 2012, or is currently, in violation (or with or without
notice or lapse of time or both, would be in violation), in any material
respect, of any term or provision of any law, rule or regulation applicable to
such Parent Agents writing, sale, management, administration or production
of insurance or other business for any Parent Insurance Subsidiary, that is
reasonably

 



46  likely to be material to Parent. To the knowledge of Parent, each Parent
Agent was appointed by Parent or Parent Insurance Subsidiary in compliance in
all material respects with applicable Insurance Laws and all processes and
procedures undertaken with respect to such Parent Agent were undertaken in
compliance, in all material respects, with applicable Insurance Laws.

 

(b) Since January 1, 2012, Parent and the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries have
made all required notices, submissions, reports or other filings under
applicable insurance holding company statutes, and all contracts, agreements,
arrangements and transactions in effect between any Parent Insurance
Subsidiary and any affiliate are in compliance in all material respects with
the requirements of all applicable insurance holding company statutes, except
where the failure to make any such notices, submissions, reports, or other
filings, or any non-compliance with such statutes, would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.

4.18 _Reinsurance and Coinsurance_.

 

(a) To the knowledge of Parent, all reinsurance or coinsurance, ceded or
assumed, treaties or agreements, including retrocessional agreements, under
which any Parent Insurance Subsidiary has any existing rights, obligations or
liabilities (including all amendments, extensions, renewals, guaranties,
modifications, waivers, supplements and other agreements, if any, related
thereto, " _Parent Reinsurance Agreements_ ") are, as of the date of this
Agreement, in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full
force and effect would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

(b) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of Parent,
any other party to a Parent Reinsurance Agreement is in breach of or in
default under any Parent Reinsurance Agreement, and, to the knowledge of
Parent, no event has occurred which, with the passage of time or the giving of
notice, or both, would constitute a default thereunder by Parent or the
Parent Subsidiary party thereto or by any other party thereto, except for such
breaches and defaults as would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will
not violate, or result in a right to terminate, recapture, rescind or modify,
any Parent Reinsurance Agreement or any coverage provided by any party
thereto, except as would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

(c) In those instances in which a Parent Insurance Subsidiary is a cedent,
neither Parent nor such Parent Insurance Subsidiary has received any written
notice that the financial condition of any other party to any Parent
Reinsurance Agreement is impaired with the result that a default thereunder
may be reasonably anticipated, except in those instances in which such default
would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and, to the knowledge of Parent, no
counterparty to a Parent Reinsurance Agreement is insolvent or the subject of
a rehabilitation, liquidation, receivership or similar proceeding.

(d) Each Parent Reinsurance Agreement is (assuming due power and authority of,
and due execution and delivery by, the other party or parties thereto) valid
and binding upon Parent or the Parent Insurance Subsidiary party thereto and,
to the knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto (except as may be limited
by the Enforceability Exceptions), except for such failures to be valid and
binding as would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 



47 4.19 _Forms and Rates_. Except as would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent,
(i) all insurance contracts, policies, binders, slips, certificates and other
agreements of insurance (including all applications, supplements,
endorsements, riders and ancillary agreements in connection therewith) issued
by the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries and any and all marketing materials
related thereto are, to the extent required under applicable Insurance Laws,
on forms approved by the applicable Regulatory Agency that have been filed
and, as appropriate, either approved or not objected to by such Regulatory
Agency within the period provided for objection and such forms comply with the
Insurance Laws applicable thereto; (ii) with respect to premium rates
established by the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries that are required to be filed
with or approved by the applicable Regulatory Agency, the rates have been so
filed or approved, the premiums charged conform thereto, and such
premiums comply with the Insurance Laws applicable thereto; and (iii) all
such insurance contracts, policies and marketing materials comply with
applicable Insurance Laws and have been administered by the Parent Insurance
Subsidiaries in accordance with applicable Insurance Laws and the terms of
the applicable insurance contracts.

4.20 _Reports of Examination_. To the knowledge of Parent, no Insurance
Regulator that noted any deficiencies or violations in any reports of
examination since January 1, 2012 has advised Parent or the applicable Parent
Insurance Subsidiary of any intention to commence any material
regulatory proceeding or to otherwise take any material disciplinary action
against such Parent Insurance Subsidiary based upon such deficiencies or
violations.

 

4.21 _Parent Information_. The information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Parent or its representatives for inclusion
in (a) the Joint Proxy Statement, on the date it (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) is first mailed to holders of Company Common Stock and at
the time of the Company Meeting, (b) the S-4, when it or any
amendment thereto becomes effective under the Securities Act, (c) the
documents and financial statements of Parent incorporated by reference in the
Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any amendment or supplement thereto or (d)
any other document filed with any other Regulatory Agency in connection
herewith, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The portions of the
Joint Proxy Statement relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries and other
portions within the reasonable control of Parent will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation
or warranty is made by Parent with respect to statements made or incorporated
by reference therein based on information provided or supplied by or on behalf
of the Company or its Subsidiaries for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement
or the S-4.

 



48 4.22 _Financing_. Parent has, or will have available to it on or prior to the
Closing Date, all funds necessary to satisfy its obligations hereunder.

4.23 _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by each of Parent and
Merger Sub in this _Article IV_ , none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other

disclaims any such other representations or warranties.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the
Company nor any other person has made or is making any express or implied
representation or warranty other than those contained in _Article III_.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1  _Regulatory Matters_.

(a) Parent and the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC, no
later than forty-five (45) days after the date of this Agreement, the Joint
Proxy Statement, and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the
S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each
of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing, and each of the Company and Parent shall thereafter mail or
deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to its shareholders. Parent shall also use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or
"Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions
of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third
parties and Governmental Entities. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, as soon as practicable and in no event later than sixty (60) days
after the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file any
applications, notices and filings required in order to obtain the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals. Parent and the Company shall each use, and shall each
cause their applicable Subsidiaries to use, their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain each such Requisite Regulatory Approval as promptly as
reasonably practicable. The parties shall cooperate with each other in
connection therewith (including the furnishing of any information and any
reasonable undertaking or commitments that may be required to obtain the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals). Parent and the Company shall have the right
to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the
other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information, all the information relating to the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party will provide the
other with copies of any applications and all correspondence relating thereto
prior to filing, other than any portions of material filed in connection
therewith that contain competitively sensitive business or other proprietary
information filed under a claim of confidentiality and subject to applicable
laws relating to the exchange of information. The parties hereto agree that
they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated

 



54  by this Agreement, and each party will keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein.
Each party shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or
conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall require Parent or the Company to take, or commit to take, any
action or agree to any condition or restriction that would reasonably be
likely to have a material and adverse effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, giving effect to the Merger (with such materiality measured
on a scale relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a
" _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

(d) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company agrees, as to itself and
its Subsidiaries, (i) that none of the information supplied or to be supplied
by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the S-4 will, at the time
the S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement
thereto will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the time of the
Company Meeting and the Parent Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which such statement was made, not misleading. Each of Parent and the
Company further agrees that if it becomes aware that any information furnished
by it would cause any of the statements in the S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
false or misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take
appropriate steps to correct the S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

 

(e) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will not be timely received.

(f) The Company shall deliver to Parent, prior to the Closing, a statement in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent certifying that the
Company has at no time during the past five (5) years been a United States
real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of
the Code.

 



55 6.2 _Access to Information; Cooperation_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of Parent
reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, personnel,
information technology systems and records, and each shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent in preparing to execute after the Effective Time
conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally
(including by entering into customary confidentiality, nondisclosure and
similar agreements with service providers), and, during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent
such information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent
may reasonably request. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any interference with the Companys regular business operations
during any such access. Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause each
of their respective Subsidiaries to, furnish or otherwise make available to
the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other
representatives of the other party such information concerning its businesses
as is reasonably relevant to such party and its shareholders in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No party shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or work-product
protection of the institution in possession or control of such information
(after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest,
joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto
will seek to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Subject to applicable law, during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement, each
party shall reasonably cooperate with the other party to reasonably assist
each other in planning and implementing necessary and appropriate policies,
procedures and other arrangements in connection with the Merger and the
Surviving Corporations and its Subsidiaries becoming Subsidiaries of Parent.
As necessary in connection therewith, each of Parent and the Company shall
designate certain of their or their Subsidiaries respective employees as
"Transition Coordinators" to coordinate planning and implementation
contemplated by this _Section 6.2(b)_.

 

(c) Within ten (10) business days of the date hereof, the Company shall
provide to Parent: (i) accurate and complete copies of each Company Contract
and Reinsurance Agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) a
complete and accurate list of all Investment Assets carried on the books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2015, (iii)
copies of the investment guidelines of each Company Insurance Subsidiary as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement and (iv) a complete and accurate list
of all material

 



56  Registered Owned Intellectual Property, in each case listing, as applicable,
(1) the name of the applicant/registrant and current owner, (2) the
jurisdiction where the application/registration is located (or, for internet
domain names, the applicable registrar), (3) the application or registration
number, and (4) the filing date, issuance/registration/grant date (other than
with respect to internet domain names) and expiration date.

(d) Each party shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the
other party or any of its Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to
_Section 6.2(a)_, _Section 6.2(b)_, _Section 6.2(c)_ or _Section 6.6(d)_
in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the
provisions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated June 15, 2015, by and
between Parent and the Company (the " _Non-Disclosure Agreement_ ").

 

(e) No investigation by Parent, the Company or their respective
representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ shall affect or be deemed to
modify or waive the representations and warranties of the other set forth
herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either Parent or the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations
of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations. 

6.3 _Shareholder Approvals_.

 

(a) The Company shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the Company
Certificate and Company Bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of
its shareholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ") to be held as soon as reasonably
practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite Company Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger, and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type
customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders to
adopt a merger agreement. The Board of Directors of the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of the Company
the Requisite Company Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders its
recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement) that they adopt and approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably
acceptable to Parent to assist in the solicitation of proxies from
shareholders relating to the Requisite Company Vote. However, subject to
_Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ , if the Board of Directors of the Company, after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that, because of
the receipt by the Company of an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior
Proposal, it would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law to
continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to
its shareholders, the Board of Directors of the Company may submit this
Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions
approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or
amended), in which event the Board of Directors of the Company may communicate
the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint
Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by law; _provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company
may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives Parent at
least five (5) business days prior written notice of its 

 



57  intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including
the latest material terms and conditions and the identity of the third party
in any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof)
and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the
Company takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement
proposed by Parent and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and,
with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good
faith that it would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation
of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this
Agreement. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed
to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 6.3_ and will
require a new notice period as referred to in this _Section 6.3_.

(b) The Board of Directors of Parent has resolved to recommend to Parents
shareholders that they approve the issuance of Parent Common Shares in
connection with the Merger, and will submit to its shareholders the proposed
issuance of Parent Common Shares and any other matters required to
be approved by its shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this
Agreement; _provided_ , that any amendment to the Articles of Association of
Parent necessary to effect the change in the name of Parent in accordance
with  _Section 6.22_ shall be submitted to its shareholders in accordance
with _Section 6.22_. Parent shall duly take, in accordance with applicable
law and the Articles of Association of Parent, all action necessary to call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders, as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose
of obtaining the Requisite Parent Vote (the " _Parent Meeting_ "). The Board
of Directors of Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from
its shareholders the Requisite Parent Vote, including by communicating to its
shareholders its recommendation that they approve the issuance of Parent
Common Shares in connection with the Merger. Parent shall engage a proxy
solicitor reasonably acceptable to Company to assist in the solicitation of
proxies from shareholders relating to the Requisite Parent Vote.

 

(c) The Company and Parent shall cooperate to schedule and convene the Company
Meeting and the Parent Meeting on the same date.

 

(d) The Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting, if, as of the
time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient
shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if
on the date of such meeting the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite
Company Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company
Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the
shareholders of the Company at the Company Meeting, for the purpose of voting
on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby,
and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such
obligation.

(e) Parent shall adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting, if, on the date of
such meeting, Parent has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Parent Vote.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Parent Meeting shall be

 



58  convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of the
Parent at the Parent Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the issuance of the
Parent Common Shares in connection with the Merger and the other matters
contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
Parent of such obligation.

 

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to _Section 6.1_,
each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply
promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party
to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall cause the Parent Common Shares to
be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notices of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the one-
year anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide continuing employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with (i) an annual base
salary or wage rate and target incentive compensation
opportunities (including annual bonus and equity-based incentive compensation
opportunities) that are no less favorable than the annual base salary or wage
rate and target incentive compensation opportunities (including annual bonus
and equity-based incentive compensation opportunities) provided to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) employee
benefits (other than severance benefits) no less favorable in the aggregate
than the employee benefits provided to the Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, (A) with respect to any Continuing Employee whose employment is
terminated by Parent or any of its affiliates on or prior to the one-year
anniversary of the Effective Time under circumstances that constitute an
"involuntary termination" or "constructive termination" (as defined in
_Section 1.7_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule), Parent shall provide, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, each such Continuing Employee with
the severance payments and benefits that such Continuing Employee would have
received under the Companys Severance Plan, as amended prior to the
Effective Time as set forth in _Section 5.2_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Severance Plan_ ") (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such
Continuing Employee shall be credited for all service with the
Company, Parent and their respective affiliates as provided in _Section
6.6(b)_ below); _provided, however_ , if any such Continuing Employee is
entitled to severance benefits under an individual severance, employment or
similar agreement, the terms of such agreement and not this _Section 6.6(a)_
shall govern. In addition, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
three-year anniversary thereof Parent shall maintain, or cause the Surviving
Corporation

 



59  to maintain, the same Company post-retirement health, medical, and life
insurance benefits as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including with respect to Company-paid subsidy levels thereunder), and
subject to any amendments to such plans after the Effective Time as required
to comply with applicable law, which shall be implemented in a manner intended
to preserve such benefits to the maximum extent possible, for the benefit of
all retired employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof, and for the benefit of all Continuing Employees who, as of
the Effective Time, were (1) hired, or deemed hired, prior to January 1,
1999, (2) would be eligible for such benefits if such Continuing Employee were
to retire as of the Effective Time, or (3) could become eligible for such
benefits if such Continuing Employee were to remain as a Continuing Employee
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the third
anniversary thereof and retire during, or at the end of, such period.

 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to (i) use reasonable best efforts to: (A) waive all
pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to each such employee and
his or her eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such
pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under
the analogous Company Benefit Plan, and (B) provide each such employee and
his or her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or deductibles
paid during the plan year in which participation under a Company Benefit Plan
(to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) commences in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans;
and (ii) recognize all service of each such employee with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessors, if applicable) for all
purposes (including eligibility to participate, vesting, and benefit accrual,
and Company-paid subsidy levels) in any New Plan to the same extent that such
service was taken into account under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing service recognition shall
not apply (x) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for
the same period of services, (y) for purposes of any New Plan that is a
defined benefit pension plan or any New Plan that provides retiree welfare
benefits, or (z) to any New Plan that is a frozen plan or provides
grandfathered benefits.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, with respect
to any Continuing Employees who are based outside of the United States,
Parents obligations under this _Section 6.6_ shall be in addition to, but
not in contravention of, any obligations required by the laws of the foreign
countries and political subdivisions thereof in which such Continuing
Employees are based.

(d) No later than thirty (30) days following the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall make available to Parent copies of each material Foreign
Company Benefit Plan, the most recent summary plan description, and the most
recent actuarial valuation report, in each case, to the extent applicable.

(e) If requested by Parent in writing at least sixty (60) business days prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the 401(k) plan sponsored or
maintained by the

 



60  Company (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_") to be terminated effective as of the
day immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence
of the Closing. In the event that Parent requests that any Company 401(k)
Plan be terminated, (i) the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that
such plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to reasonable review and comment by Parent) not later than two days
immediately preceding the Effective Time and (ii) the Continuing Employees
shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a
401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (a "
_Parent 401(k) Plan_ "). Parent shall take any and all actions as may be
required, including amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan and/or Parent 401(k)
Plan to permit the Continuing Employees who are then actively employed to
make rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover
distributions" (with the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the
form of cash, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof in an
amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such Continuing
Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan.

 

(f) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" of the Company or
other event with similar import, within the meaning of the Company Benefit
Plans that contain such terms will occur upon the Effective Time. Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, assume, fulfill
and discharge the Companys and its Subsidiaries obligations under the
Company Benefit Plans, and to honor and effectuate the agreements and
provisions set forth in _Section 6.6_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, it
being understood that, subject to _Section 6.6(a)_, the foregoing shall not
be construed to limit the right of the Surviving Corporation, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend or terminate any such Company
Benefit Plans, to the extent permitted by the terms of such Company Benefit
Plans and applicable laws.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or, subject
to _Section 6.6(a)_ hereof, shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or
affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee,
officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.
Subject to _Section 6.6(a)_ hereof, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to (i) establish, amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any
other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii)
alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular
Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting
the generality of the final sentence of _Section 9.11_, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person
(other than the parties hereto), other than the parties hereto, including any
current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



61 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director, officer or employee of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or fiduciaries of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under Company Benefit Plans (in each case, when acting in such capacity)
(collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective
Time, arising in whole or in part out of (i) the fact that such person is or
was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or is or was a fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
Company Benefit Plans or (ii) matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated
hereby, to the same extent as such persons are indemnified as of the date of
this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company Certificate, the Company
Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary
and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof; and
Parent shall also cause the Surviving Corporation to advance expenses as
incurred by such Company Indemnified Party to the same extent as such persons
are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by
the Company pursuant to the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, the
governing or organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary and any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof; _provided_ that
the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form) to repay such advances if it
is ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled
to indemnification.

(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company ( _provided_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured)
with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which
occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of
the aggregate annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for
such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Parent shall
cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in Parents good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may in
consultation with Parent (and at the request of Parent, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a
six-year "tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the
preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an
amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If either
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective successors or
assigns, consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfers all
or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engages
in any similar transaction, then in each case, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, will cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, will expressly assume the obligations of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

 



62 6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the
parties to the Merger, each party to this Agreement and their respective
Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary action as
may be reasonably requested by any other party, at the expense of the party
who makes any such request.

 

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly advise
the other of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it (i) that has
had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii)
which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in _Article
VII_ to be satisfied; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute a violation
of this _Section 6.9_ or provide a basis for terminating this Agreement or
constitute the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be
satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party
failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying fact, change
or circumstance would independently result in a failure of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied or provide a basis for terminating
this Agreement.

6.10 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors,
agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or
participate in any negotiations with any person concerning or (iii) provide
any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate
in any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , that, prior to receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, in the
event Company receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
and the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is more likely than not to result in
a Superior Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to
the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after
receiving the advice of its outside

 



63  counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that
failure to take such actions would result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law;  _provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to
providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the
foregoing proviso, the Company shall have provided notice to Parent of its
intention to provide such information, and shall have provided such
information to Parent if not previously provided to Parent, and shall have
entered into a non-disclosure agreement with such third party on terms no less
favorable to it than the Non-Disclosure Agreement, which non-
disclosure agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right
to negotiate with the Company. The Company will, and will cause its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) advise Parent following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the
identity of the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), and will
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent of any
related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis,
including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry
or Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts,
subject to applicable law, to (x) enforce any existing non-disclosure,
standstill or similar agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party relating to an Acquisition Proposal, and (y) within ten (10) business
days after the date hereof, request and confirm the return or destruction of
any confidential information provided to any person (other than Parent and its
affiliates) pursuant to any such non-disclosure, standstill or similar
agreement. Unless this Agreement is contemporaneously terminated in accordance
with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not
to on its behalf, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, or other agreement (other than a non-disclosure agreement referred
to and entered into in accordance with this  _Section 6.10(a)_) relating to
any Acquisition Proposal).

(b) As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or
inquiry relating to, or any third-party indication of interest in, (i) any
acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of twenty percent (20%) or more
of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including by
way of reinsurance or otherwise) or twenty percent (20%) or more of any class
of equity or voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than twenty percent
(20%) of the consolidated assets of the Company, (ii) any tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party
beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of equity or
voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than twenty percent (20%) of
the consolidated assets of the Company, or (iii) a merger, consolidation,
share exchange, other business combination, reorganization, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or
its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
more than twenty percent (20%) of the consolidated assets of the Company.

 

(c) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
concludes in good faith to be

 



64  more favorable from a financial point of view to its shareholders than the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (i) after receiving the
advice of its financial advisors (who shall be a nationally recognized
investment banking firm), (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of
consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii)
after taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside counsel),
financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal (including any expense reimbursement provisions
and conditions to closing) and any other relevant factors permitted under
applicable law; _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of "Superior
Proposal," the references to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "a majority."

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board
of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such Rules will in
no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules
would otherwise have under this Agreement.

6.11 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall each use their
respective reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications
plan, (b) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such
joint communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement
required by (i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) a request by a Governmental
Entity or (iii) an obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules
of any securities exchange, each of the Company and Parent agrees to consult
with the other and to obtain the advance approval of the other (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any
press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

6.12 _Change of Method_. Parent may at any time change the method of
effecting the transactions contemplated hereby if and to the extent requested
by Parent, and the Company hereby agrees to enter into such amendments to this
Agreement as Parent may reasonably request in order to give effect to such
restructuring, including effecting the Merger through other wholly owned
Subsidiaries of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change or
amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the
Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect
the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to the Companys shareholders or
(iii) be reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be materially delayed or
the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or
materially delayed.

6.13 _Restructuring Efforts_. If the Company shall have failed to obtain the
Requisite Company Vote at the duly convened Company Meeting or any adjournment
or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use its
reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the
transactions provided for herein ( _provided_ , _however_ , that no party
shall have any obligation to agree to (i) alter or change any material term of
this Agreement, including the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, in a
manner adverse to such party or its shareholders or (ii) adversely affect the
Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to the Companys shareholders) and/or
resubmit this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (or as
restructured pursuant to this _Section 6.13_) to its shareholders for
approval or adoption.

 



65 6.14 _Takeover Statutes_. No party shall take any action that would cause any
Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each party shall take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from
any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover
Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, each party and its respective Board of Directors will
grant such approvals and take such actions within its control as are necessary
so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary,
challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 

6.15 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and the Company shall each take such steps as may be necessary
or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company Common Stock (or

Common Stock) and any acquisition of Parent Common Shares (or any derivative
securities in respect of Parent Common Shares) by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company, or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

6.16 _Deregistration of Company Common Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and take such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate on its part under the Exchange Act (including the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) and the rules and policies of
the NYSE to enable the de-listing of the Company Common Stock from the NYSE
and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

6.17 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
notify each other in writing of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing,
investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced,
brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving, any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or
the Company, as applicable, threatened against Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be
expected to question the validity of this Agreement or the other agreements
contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to be taken by Parent,
the Company or their respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto,
or (b) seeks to enjoin, materially delay or otherwise restrain the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of
any shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or
affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no
such settlement shall be agreed without Parents prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



66 6.18 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries respective

72 ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of this Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company:

 

(a) by mutual consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company in a written
instrument;

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity that must grant
a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby and such denial has become final and
nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued a final nonappealable order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby, unless the failure to obtain a
Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein;

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the one-year anniversary of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to
occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of
such party set forth herein;

(d) by either Parent or the Company ( _provided_ , that the terminating party
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of
the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or
any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent,
or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach or
failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other
breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to
be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date,
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_, as
the case may be, and which is not cured within the earlier of the Termination
Date and forty-five (45) days following written notice to the Company, in the
case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by
the Company, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period; or

 

(e) by Parent, if (i) prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company (A) submits
this Agreement to its shareholders without a recommendation for approval, or
otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely modifies (or publicly
discloses its intention to withdraw or materially and adversely modify)
its recommendation as contemplated by _Section 6.3(a)_, or recommends to its
shareholders an Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, or (B) materially
breaches its

 



73  obligations under _Section 6.3_ or its obligations under _Section 6.10_;
or (ii) a tender offer or exchange offer for 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock is commenced (other than by Parent or a
Subsidiary thereof), and the Board of Directors of the Company recommends that
the shareholders of the Company tender their shares in such tender or exchange
offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such shareholders reject such
tender offer or exchange offer within the 10 business day period specified in
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d) or (e) of this _Section 8.1_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in accordance with _Section 9.5_, specifying
the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is
effected.

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of Parent, Company, Merger Sub, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i)
_Sections 3.3(a)_ , _3.7_ , _4.3(a)_ , _4.7_ , _6.2(d)_ , this _Section 8.2_
and _Article IX_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor the Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or
damages arising out of its willful and material breach of any provision of
this Agreement (which, in the case of the Company, may include the loss to
the holders of Company Common Stock of the economic benefits of the Merger).

 

(b) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to senior management of the
Company or shall have been made directly to its shareholders generally or any
person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company and (A) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_
without the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained or (B) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, and (C)
prior to the date that is eighteen (18) months after the date of such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a
transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same
Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then the Company shall, on
the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date
of consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day
funds, a fee equal to $930,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ ,
that for purposes of this _Section 8.2(b)_, all references in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%".

 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)_ (or this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)_) but at the time of such termination Parent could have terminated this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_), then the Company shall pay Parent,
by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee as promptly as
reasonably practical after the date of termination

 



74  (and, in any event, within three (3) business days thereafter).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum aggregate
amount of fees payable by the Company under this _Section 8.2_ shall be equal
to the Termination Fee, and in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay
the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to
pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the
Company for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay
the costs and expenses of Parent (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if the Company fails to
pay the amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, then the Company
shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of
the date that any such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and
ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a
rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as reported by _The Wall
Street Journal_ or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such
payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that
such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
