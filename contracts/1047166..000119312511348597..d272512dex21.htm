AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 15, 2011 (this "

").

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Purchaser and the
Company have approved the merger of the Company with and into Purchaser (the "
_Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the parties intend for the Merger to qualify as a reorganization for
United States federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section

of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-2(g);

WHEREAS, the parties desire that immediately following the Merger, Purchaser
shall cause RSC Holdings III, LLC (" _R III_"), a Delaware limited liability
company and wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and United Rentals (North
America), Inc. (" _U Opco_"), a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
Subsidiary of Purchaser, each to merge with and into a newly formed Delaware
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser (" _U Newco_
") (collectively, the " _Subsequent Mergers_ "), upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement and have approved such Subsequent Mergers;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Purchaser and the
Company have each unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of
their respective companies and stockholders to consummate the Merger and the

warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE I

forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), the Company shall be merged with and
into Purchaser at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.03). As a result
of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and
Purchaser shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). The Merger shall have the effects specified in the
DGCL.

SECTION 1.02. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New
York, New York 10004, at 10:00 a.m. local time, on the date that is the later

those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement, (b) the earlier of (i) a date
during the Marketing Period specified by Purchaser on no fewer than three (3)
Business Days notice to the Company and (ii) the final day of the Marketing
Period, and (c) such other time, date or place as Purchaser and the Company
may mutually agree in writing. The time and date of the Closing is referred
to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable following the Closing, the
parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate
of Merger_ "), in such form as required by, and executed and acknowledged by
the parties in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and
shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time when
the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such later time as Purchaser and the Company shall agree in
writing and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_
").

 

SECTION 1.04. _Charter and Bylaws_. (a) The restated certificate of
incorporation of Purchaser in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Purchaser Charter_ "), until duly amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

 

(b) The amended and restated bylaws of Purchaser in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Purchaser Bylaws_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

 



2 SECTION 1.05. _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The parties hereto
shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary so that the three

independent directors of the board of directors of the Company (as determined
in accordance with rules of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (" _NYSE_ ")) as
of the date hereof and will be independent directors of the Surviving
Corporation (as determined in accordance with the rules of the NYSE) as of the
Effective Time. Except for the additional individuals nominated for election
to the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the
preceding sentence, the directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the

specified in the provisions of the DGCL and as a result of the Subsequent
Mergers, the separate corporate existences of R III and U Opco shall cease and
U Newco shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Subsequent Mergers

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE

CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 2.01. _Conversion and Cancellation of Securities_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or Purchaser:

(a) _Effect on Purchaser Stock_. Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value
(each, a " _Purchaser Common Share_ "), of Purchaser issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding;

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares_. Each share
of common stock, no par value (the " _Company Common Shares_ "), of the
Company issued and, if applicable, outstanding that is owned by the Company,
Purchaser or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company
or Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time, and in each case not
held on behalf of third parties (" _Excluded Shares_ "), and each Company
Common Share that is owned by a 

 



3  stockholder ("a _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has perfected and not
withdrawn a demand for, or lost its right to, appraisal pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL with respect to such Company Common Share (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall cease to be, if applicable, outstanding, shall be cancelled
without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist,
subject only, with respect to the Dissenting Shares, to the rights of the
holders of Dissenting Shares as described in Section 2.03; and

 

(c) _Effect on Company Common Shares_. (i) Subject to Section 2.04(d), each
Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and any Dissenting Shares)
(collectively, the " _Eligible Shares_ ") shall be converted into and shall
thereafter represent the following consideration: (i) the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to $10.80 (the " _Per Share Cash Amount_ ") and (ii)
0.2783 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable Purchaser Common Share, in each case without interest.

(ii) The Purchaser Common Shares to be issued, and cash payable, upon
the conversion of the Company Common Shares pursuant to this Section 2.01(c)
and cash in lieu of fractional Purchaser Common Shares as contemplated by
Section 2.04(h) are referred to as " _Purchaser Share Consideration_ " and "
_Cash Consideration_ ," respectively, and collectively as " _Merger
Consideration_." As of the Effective Time, all Company Common Shares that have
been converted pursuant to this Section 2.01(c) shall cease to be
outstanding, shall cease to exist and shall be cancelled, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such Company Common Shares (a " _Certificate_ ")
or Company Common Shares held in book entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive, in accordance with this Section 2.01(c), the Merger Consideration and
any other amounts herein provided, upon surrender of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares, without interest thereon.

(d) _Adjustments_. (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary but without limiting the effect of Section 7.02(a) or 7.03(a), if
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the issued and
outstanding Company Common Shares or Purchaser Common Shares are changed into
a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment, or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon
shall be declared with a record date within such period, then the Merger
Consideration, Exchange Ratio, Option Exchange Ratio and other dependent items
shall be equitably adjusted so as to provide the holders of Company Common
Shares with the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event,
be the Merger Consideration, Exchange Ratio, Option Exchange Ratio or other
dependent item.

 



4 (ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the Threshold Percentage (determined without regard to this sentence) would
be less than 40.0%, then an amount of cash otherwise payable as Cash
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(ii), equal to the amount of cash
which would be necessary to cause the recomputed Threshold Percentage to
equal 40.0% shall instead be payable in an equivalent amount of Purchaser
Common Shares (with each Purchaser Common Share valued for this purpose using
the Applicable Stock Value).

 

The term " _Threshold Percentage_ " shall mean the quotient, expressed as a
percentage, obtained by dividing (a) the Aggregate Share Consideration by (b)
the sum of (1) the Aggregate Share Consideration plus (2) the Aggregate Cash
Amount.

The term " _Aggregate Share Consideration_ " shall mean the product of (a)
the aggregate number of Purchaser Common Shares to be delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, multiplied by (b) the Applicable Stock Value.

 

The term " _Applicable Stock Value_ " shall mean $25.875.

The term " _Aggregate Cash Amount_ " shall mean the aggregate amount of cash
to be paid to the holders of Company Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement
(including any payments to Dissenting Stockholders) in exchange for their
Company Common Shares. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.01(d)(ii),
Dissenting Stockholders shall be deemed to receive an amount of cash equal to
$21.60 per Dissenting Share, or such other amount, which may be higher or
lower, as the parties determine in good faith taking into account the
principles of clause (iii) below (it being understood that the actual amount
that would be payable to any Dissenting Stockholder following completion of
an appraisal proceeding would be determined pursuant to such appraisal
proceeding in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware law).

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment provided in Section
2.01(d)(ii) is intended only to ensure that the Merger qualifies as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, and
shall be interpreted accordingly and not used for any other purpose.

 

SECTION 2.02. _Treatment of Company Stock Options; Company Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to purchase
Company Common Shares granted under the Companys Amended and Restated Stock
Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock Incentive Plan_ ") (whether vested or
unvested, exercisable or unexercisable) (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ")
which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without
any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be converted into an
option to purchase the number of Purchaser Common Shares determined by
multiplying the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio
(as defined below) (rounded down, if necessary, to a

 



5  whole Purchaser Common Share), at an exercise price per Purchaser Common
Share equal to the exercise price per Company Common Share of such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Option
Exchange Ratio (rounded, if necessary, up to the nearest whole cent), it being
understood that the exercise price and number of Purchaser Common Shares for
which each Company Stock Option is exercisable is intended to be determined
in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Code_ "). Except as specifically provided in this Section
2.02, following the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall otherwise
be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Company
Stock Option under the Company Stock Incentive Plan and Company Stock Option
agreements immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references
to the Company in the Company Stock Incentive Plan and the applicable Company
Stock Option agreements shall be deemed to refer to Purchaser, which shall
have assumed the Company Stock Incentive Plan as of the Effective Time by
virtue of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and without
any further action, and all references to Company Common Shares shall be
deemed to be to Purchaser Common Shares. The " _Option Exchange Ratio_ "
shall mean the sum of (i) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) the quotient determined
by dividing the Per Share Cash Amount by the volume-weighted average of the
closing sale prices of Purchaser Common Shares as reported on the NYSE
composite transactions reporting system for each of the ten consecutive
trading days ending with the Closing Date.

(b) _Company Awards_. At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award
granted under the Company Stock Incentive Plan (each, a " _Company Award_ "),
other than a Company Award held by a member of the Companys board who is not
also an employee or officer of the Company (each, a " _Director Award_ "),
shall be converted into the right to acquire the number of Purchaser Common
Shares, determined by multiplying the number of Company Common Shares subject
to such Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option
Exchange Ratio (rounded down, if necessary, to a whole Purchaser Common
Share); _provided_ , that with respect to the portion of any Company Award
that conditions vesting on both the achievement of performance measures and
service-based vesting conditions, the performance measures shall be deemed
satisfied at the target level, but the service-based vesting conditions shall
continue to apply in accordance with the terms of such Company Award. Except
as specifically provided in this Section 2.02, following the Effective Time,
each such Company Award shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the Company Awards under the Company Stock
Incentive Plan and Company Award agreements immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that all references to the Company in the Company
Stock Incentive Plan and the applicable Company Award agreements shall be
deemed to refer to Purchaser, which shall have assumed the Company Stock
Incentive Plan as of the Effective Time by virtue of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and without any further action, and all
references to Company Common Shares shall be deemed to be to Purchaser Common
Shares. At the Effective Time, each Director Award shall, without any further
action on 

 



6  the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive from Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, with respect to each
Company Common Share covered by such award, (i) an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the Per Share Cash Amount and (ii) a number of Purchaser
Common Shares determined by multiplying the number of Company Common Shares
subject to such Director Award by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down, if
necessary, to a whole Purchaser Common Share), plus any accrued dividend
equivalents (as determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement)
in respect of such Director Award with a record date prior to the Effective
Time which have been authorized by the Company and which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time.

(c) _Treatment under the Company Stock Incentive Plan_. For the avoidance of
doubt, (i) the Company Stock Options and Company Awards as converted pursuant
to this Section 2.02 shall be "Alternative Awards" within the meaning of the
Company Stock Incentive Plan and, without limiting any rights enjoyed by the
holders thereof with respect to vesting or otherwise, or any right to
accelerate vesting under the Company Stock Incentive Plan and related award
agreements thereunder, shall be afforded the "double-trigger" vesting
protections as set forth in the Company Stock Incentive Plan, and (ii) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
constitute the first trigger of such vesting protection. 

(d) _Registration_. If registration of any interests in the Company Stock
Incentive Plan or the Purchaser Common Shares issuable thereunder is required
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (including the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "), Purchaser shall
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") within five
(5) business days after the Effective Time a registration statement on Form
S-8 with respect to such interests or Purchaser Common Shares, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as the Company Stock Incentive Plan remains
in effect and such registration of interests therein or the Purchaser Common
Shares issuable thereunder continues to be required. As soon as practicable
after the registration of such interests or shares, as applicable, Purchaser
shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options and Company Awards
appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to
the Company Stock Incentive Plan and agreements evidencing the grants of such
Company Stock Options and Company Awards, and stating that the Company
Incentive Plan and such Company Stock Options and Company Awards and
agreements have been assumed by Purchaser and shall continue in effect on the
terms and conditions specified in this Section 2.02.

(e) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee thereof, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are
necessary or advisable to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.02. At
or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall take all actions which are
necessary for the assumption of the Company Stock Incentive Plan, Company
Stock Options and Company Awards 

 



7  pursuant to this Section 2.02 including the reservation, issuance (subject
to Section 2.02(c)) and listing of Purchaser Common Shares as necessary to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.02. The Company shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time
neither Purchaser nor the Exchange Agent (as defined below) will be required
to deliver Company Common Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any
person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Stock Options or Company
Awards.

 

SECTION 2.03. _Dissenting Shares_. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Dissenting Shares shall not be
converted as provided in Sections 2.01 and 2.02, but rather such holders shall
be entitled only to payment by Purchaser of the "fair value" of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such stockholder of the Company shall fail to perfect
or effectively waive, withdraw or lose such stockholders rights under Section
262 of the DGCL, the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Dissenting Shares shall thereupon cease and such Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to
have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration as provided in Sections 2.01(c) and 2.02. The Company shall
serve prompt notice to Purchaser of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any Company Common Shares, and Purchaser shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

SECTION 2.04. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_.

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall enter into an exchange agent
agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company with a
nationally recognized financial institution designated by Purchaser and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), it being
agreed by the parties that the American Stock Transfer and Trust Company is
acceptable. At the Effective Time, Purchaser shall (A) deposit with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Shares,
subject to Section 2.04(b)(ii), certificates representing the full number of
Purchaser Common Shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 in exchange for
outstanding Company Common Shares and (B) provide or cause to be provided to
the Exchange Agent all of the cash necessary to pay the aggregate Cash
Consideration. Purchaser shall, after the Effective Time on the
appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be provided to
the Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on such
Purchaser Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.04(c) (such Purchaser Common
Shares and cash provided to the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends
or other

 



8  distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). In addition to the foregoing, Purchaser shall make
available to the Exchange Agent, for deposit in the Exchange Fund, from time
to time as needed, immediately available funds sufficient to pay cash in lieu
of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.04(h). Purchaser shall cause
the Exchange Agent to deliver the Purchaser Common Shares and cash
contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.01 or 2.04(h) out of the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(ii) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash deposited with the Exchange
Agent by Purchaser as directed by Purchaser. Any interest or income produced
by such investments shall not be deemed part of the Exchange Fund and shall be
payable to Purchaser. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to
any such investments, Purchaser shall promptly replace or restore the cash in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to pay cash in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.04(h).

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) _Certificates_. Purchaser shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose shares were converted into Purchaser Share
Consideration and the right to receive Cash Consideration pursuant to Section
2.01 and any cash in lieu of fractional Purchaser Common Shares pursuant to
Section 2.04(h), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.04(e)) and shall
be in customary form and have such other provisions as are reasonably
satisfactory to both the Company and Purchaser) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 2.04(e)) in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. If any Dissenting Shares cease to be Dissenting Shares pursuant
to Section 2.03, Purchaser shall cause the Exchange Agent promptly (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days) after the date on which such Dissenting
Shares cease to be Dissenting Shares to mail to the holder of record of such
Company Common Shares the letter of transmittal and instructions referred to
in the immediately preceding sentence, with respect to such Company Common
Shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and executed in
accordance with its instructions, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Purchaser shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor, as promptly
as practicable (A) the Per Share Cash Amount (less any required withholding
taxes

 



9  as provided in Section 2.04(f)), (B) the number of whole Purchaser Common
Shares (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c)
(after taking into account all Eligible Shares then held by such holder), (C)
any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.04(c) and
(D) cash in lieu of fractional Purchaser Common Shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.04(h), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be
made and shares may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if the applicable letter of
transmittal is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
reasonably required by Purchaser to evidence and effect such transfer, such
Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and
the person requesting such payment pays any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Subject to Section 2.03, until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.04, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the Purchaser
Share Consideration and the right to receive Cash Consideration upon such
surrender, in each case, into which the Company Common Shares theretofore
represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section
2.01(c), dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.04(c)
and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.04(h).
No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Article II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record
of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Company Common Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions payable thereon pursuant to Section 2.04(c) shall automatically
upon the Effective Time (or, at any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares
shall be so converted) be entitled to receive, and Purchaser shall cause the
Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time, in respect of each Company Common Share (A) the Per Share
Cash Amount, (B) the number of whole Purchaser Common Shares (which shall be
in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested
by such holder of record) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to 2.01(c) (after
taking into account all Eligible Shares then held by such holder), (C) any
dividends or distributions

 



10  payable pursuant to Section 2.04(c) and (D) cash in lieu of any fractional
shares payable pursuant to Section 2.04(h), and the Book-Entry Shares of such
holder shall forthwith be cancelled.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. All Purchaser Common Shares to be issued pursuant to the
Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and
whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Purchaser in respect
of the Purchaser Common Shares, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No
dividends or other distributions in respect of the Purchaser Common Shares
shall be paid to any holder of an unsurrendered Certificate until
such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificate as
provided in Section 2.04(e)) is surrendered for exchange in accordance with
this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender
of any such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificate as
provided in Section 2.04(e)), there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder
of the Certificates representing whole Purchaser Common Shares issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such whole Purchaser Common Shares and not
paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such whole Purchaser Common Shares with
a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to
the time of such payment and delivery by the Exchange Agent under Section
2.04(b)(ii) payable with respect to Purchaser Common Shares.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Holders of Book-Entry Shares who are entitled to
receive Purchaser Common Shares under this Article II shall be issued and/or
paid (A) at the time of payment and delivery of such Purchaser Common Shares
by the Exchange Agent under Section 2.04(b)(ii), the dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable
with respect to such whole Purchaser Common Shares and not paid and (B) at the
appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such whole Purchaser Common Shares with a record date after the
Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 

(d) _Transfers_. The Merger Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with
the terms of this Article II upon the surrender of the Certificates (or,
automatically, in the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have
been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Company Common Shares (other than the right to receive the payments and
deliveries contemplated by this Article II). After the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of Company Common Shares that

 



11  were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing Company Common Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by Purchaser, the posting by such
person of a bond in reasonable amount as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate Purchaser
Common Shares, the Cash Consideration and the cash, unpaid dividends or other
distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been
surrendered as provided in this Article II.

(f) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company
Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts, in cash, as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax
Law. Any amount properly deducted or withheld pursuant to this Section 2.04(f)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of Company Common Shares in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.

(g) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the holders
of Company Common Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Purchaser, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Shares
who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to Purchaser for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration and
any dividends or distributions with respect to Purchaser Common Shares as
contemplated by Section 2.04(c) (less any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 2.04(f)), without any interest thereon, upon (i) due
surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 2.04(e))) and (ii) if requested by the Surviving
Corporation, delivery of a letter of transmittal in customary form that is
provided promptly to such record holder by the Surviving Corporation, in each
case, to the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Purchaser nor the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
person for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(h) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no certificates or scrip representing fractional Purchaser Common
Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or Book-

 



12  Entry Shares. In lieu of any such fractional shares, any holder of Company
Common Shares entitled to receive a fractional Purchaser Common Share but for
this Section 2.04(h) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu
thereof, which payment shall be calculated by the Exchange Agent as an amount
equal to the product of (A) the amount of the fractional share interests in a
Company Common Share to which such holder is entitled under Section 2.01(c)
(or would be entitled but for this Section 2.04(h)) and (B) an amount equal to
the volume-weighted average of the closing sale prices of Purchaser Common
Shares as reported on the NYSE composite transactions reporting system for
each of the 10 consecutive trading days ending with the last complete trading
day prior to the Closing Date. Any such sale shall be made by the Exchange
Agent within five business days after the date upon which the Certificate(s)
(or affidavit(s) of loss in lieu of the Certificates(s) as provided in Section
2.04(f)) that would otherwise result in the issuance of such fractional
Purchaser Common Shares have been received by the Exchange Agent.
All fractional shares to which a single record holder of Company Common
Shares would otherwise be entitled to receive hereunder shall be aggregated
and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places.

 

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in (a) the Company SEC Documents filed with the SEC and
made publicly available after December 31, 2010 and prior to the date of this
Agreement (excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk
factor section or in any other section to the extent that they are forward-
looking statements or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature);
_provided, however_ , that the exception provided for in this clause (a) shall
be applied with respect to a particular representation or warranty if, and
only if, the nature and content of the applicable disclosure in any such
document is reasonably specific as to the matters and items which are the
subject of such representation or warranty; or (b) the corresponding sections
or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to Purchaser by the Company
in connection with this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it
being agreed that (i) disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of
the Company Disclosure Letter shall also be deemed disclosure with respect to
any other section or subsection of this Agreement to which the relevance of
such item is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure) and (ii) the

had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,

hereby could, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) require a
"gross-up" or other payment to any "disqualified individual" within the
meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code due to the imposition of the excise tax
under Section 4999 of the Code on any payment to such disqualified individual
or due to the failure of any payment to such disqualified individual to be
deductible under of Section 280G of the Code or (ii) result in

 



30  the payment of any amount that would, individually or in combination with
any other such payment, reasonably be construed to constitute an "excess
parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code. The Company
has made available to Purchaser any Section 280G calculations prepared
(whether or not final) with respect to any disqualified individual in
connection with the contemplated transaction.

compliance with its terms and the operational and documentary requirements of
Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder, in each case, in all
material respects. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any obligation

compensation committee thereof. No Company Stock-Based Award is intended to be
an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.
The per share exercise price of each Company Stock-Based Award, when

as determined in good faith, on the appropriate date on which the related
grant was by its terms to be effective.

SECTION 3.14. _Taxes_. (a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has (i)

rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are not provided for in

obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise,
whether known or unknown) whether or not required, if known, to be reflected
or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet (or the related notes and
schedules thereto) of Purchaser prepared in accordance with GAAP or the
notes thereto, except liabilities (i) as reflected, reserved for or disclosed

structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on

Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the Purchaser
SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are

procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed

responsible for the preparation of Purchasers filings with the SEC and other
public disclosure documents. Purchaser maintains internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under
the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective
in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Purchaser and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of Purchaser and its
consolidated Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with

Subsidiaries, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets
of Purchaser and its consolidated Subsidiaries that could have a material
effect on its financial statements. Purchaser has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to Purchasers
auditors and the audit committee of Purchasers board of directors (A) all
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Purchasers

 



43  ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
has identified for Purchasers auditors and audit committee of Purchasers
board of directors any material weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in Purchasers internal control
over financial reporting. Purchaser has made available to the Company (i) a
summary of any such disclosure made by management to Purchasers auditors and
audit committee since December 31, 2010 and (ii) any communication since

committee required or contemplated by listing standards of the NYSE, the audit
committees charter or professional standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board.

 

(f) Since December 31, 2010, no material written complaints or, to Purchasers
Knowledge, material oral complaints from any source regarding accounting,
internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no material written
concerns or, to Purchasers Knowledge, material oral concerns from employees
of Purchaser and its consolidated Subsidiaries regarding questionable
accounting or auditing matters, have been received by Purchaser. No attorney
representing Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation
of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
Purchaser or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to
Purchasers chief legal officer, audit committee (or other committee
designated for the purpose) of the board of directors or the board of
directors pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to Section 307 of SOX or any
Purchaser policy contemplating such reporting, including in instances not
required by those rules.

 

SECTION 4.07. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2010
through and including the date hereof, (i) there has not been any change in
the business, financial condition or results of operation of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any other change, event, effect,
development, state of facts, condition, occurrence or circumstance that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect and (ii) neither Purchaser nor any of
its Subsidiaries has taken any action which, if taken after the date of this

and Purchaser (the " _Financing Commitment_ "), pursuant to which, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the lenders party
thereto have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein (the "
_Financing_ ") for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Financing Commitment has not been amended or modified
prior to the date of this Agreement, and, as of the date hereof,
the respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitment have not
been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. Except for fee letters
and engagement letter relating to the Financing Commitment (collectively, the
" _Fee Letters_ "), complete copies of which have been provided to the
Company with only fee amounts and certain economic terms (none of which would
adversely affect the amount (other than in respect of upfront fees) or
availability of the Financing if so exercised by the lenders party thereto)
redacted, as of the date hereof, there are no other agreements, side letters
or arrangements to which Purchaser is a party relating to the Financing
Commitment that could affect the availability of the Financing. As of the
date hereof, the Financing Commitment constitutes the legally valid and
binding obligation of Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of the Purchaser, the
other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights, and by general
equitable principles). As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitment is in
full force and effect and has not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or
otherwise amended or modified in any respect, and no such amendment

terms or conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment, and assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Article III and 

 



46  performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, as of
the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach, default or
failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth therein. As of the date
hereof, no lender has notified Purchaser of its intention to terminate the
Financing Commitment or not to provide the Financing. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing (including any "flex" provisions), other than as expressly set
forth in the Financing Commitment and the Fee Letters. Assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.03 and
performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, the
aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the definitive agreements
contemplated by the Financing Commitment, in the aggregate and together with
the available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of Purchaser
and the Company, and available amounts under existing credit facilities, will
be sufficient for Purchaser to pay the Cash Consideration and all related
fees and expenses on the terms contemplated hereby. As of the date hereof,
Purchaser has paid in full any and all commitment or other fees required by
the Financing Commitments that are due as of the date hereof. As of the date
hereof, Purchaser has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy
on a timely basis any conditions to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, or that the Financing will not be available to Purchaser on
the Closing Date.

paid or accrued (in accordance with GAAP) all material Taxes for all tax
periods required to be paid or accrued by any of them, and (iii) withheld from

(including income, social security and employment Tax withholding for all

United States federal income Tax Returns filed by Purchaser and its

memoranda or similar agreement or rulings have been entered into or issued by
any Tax authority with respect to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates which are
still in effect as of the date of this Agreement. 

(g) There are no material Liens for Taxes upon the assets, properties or
rights of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries that are not provided for in
the Purchaser SEC Documents, except Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable
and Liens for Taxes that are being contested in good faith, which contest, if
determined adversely to Purchaser, would not individually or in the aggregate
have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

(h) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a party to
the distribution of stock of a "controlled corporation" as defined in Section
355(a) of the Code in a transaction intended to qualify under Section 355 of
the Code within the past two years.

Regulations thereunder, as in effect and as amended by any guidance published
by the IRS for the applicable period. 

 



48 (j) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated United States federal income Tax
Return (other than a group the common parent of which is Purchaser), or has
any liability for Taxes of any person (other than Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any analogous or
similar provision of state, local, or foreign tax law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise.

SECTION 4.16. _Insurance_. All material property, fire and casualty, general
liability, managed care liability, employment practices liability, fiduciary
liability, product liability, directors and officers liability, automotive,
workers compensation and sprinkler and water damage insurance policies
maintained by Purchaser and/or its Subsidiaries are with reputable insurance
carriers, provide full and adequate coverage for all normal risks incident to
the businesses of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and their respective
properties and assets, and are in character and amount at least equivalent to
that carried by persons engaged in similar businesses and subject to the same
or similar perils or hazards, except for any failures to maintain such
insurance policies that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect. The consummation of the Merger, the Subsequent Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated in this Agreement will not, in and of themselves,
cause the revocation, cancellation or termination of any such insurance
policy.

 

SECTION 4.17. _No Ownership of Company Common Shares_. No Company Common
Shares or securities that are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into
Company Common Shares are beneficially owned (directly or indirectly,

relating to its or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates respective
businesses, operations, financial condition or legal status, including any

expected to impair the ability of the parties to this Agreement to obtain any
Required Governmental Consent. 

SECTION 4.19. _Absence of Arrangements with Management_. Other than this
Agreement and the Voting Agreement, there are no contracts, undertakings,
commitments, agreements or obligations or understandings between Purchaser or

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time.

that (a) except for the specific representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement (subject to the Company Disclosure Letter
and the Company SEC Reports in accordance with this Agreement), none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective stockholders,
controlling persons or Representatives makes or has made any representation or
warranty, either express or implied, with respect to the Company, its

based upon any information provided or made available, or statements made (or
any omissions therefrom), to Purchaser, its Subsidiaries or any of its or
their respective stockholders, controlling persons, Financing Sources or
Representatives, except, solely with respect to the Company, as and only to
the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement or for claims made by

acquisition of equity interests or assets, joint venture or otherwise) any
business or any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture or other business organization or division thereof or otherwise enter

such Required Governmental Consents; or

(h) authorize any of, or commit, resolve, propose or agree to take any of, the

shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Company

stockholders prior to the Purchaser Stockholders Meeting. 

(c) The Company and the Purchaser shall cooperate to schedule and convene the

SECTION 6.02. _Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_. As promptly
as practicable after the date of this Agreement and in any event no later than
January 17, 2012 of this Agreement, (i) Purchaser and the Company shall
jointly prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and (ii) Purchaser shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-4 in connection with the Purchaser Share Issuance (as may
be further amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Form S-4_"), in
which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus.
Each of the Company and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to

applicable provisions of the Securities Act and to have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such
filing. Each of the Company and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and to be
mailed to its respective stockholders as promptly as practicable after the
Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Purchaser shall also
take any action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in

process in any such jurisdiction) in connection with the Purchaser Share
Issuance, and each of Purchaser and the Company shall furnish all information
as may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such
action, the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The Company
shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser in
connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution
of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. No filing,
amendment, supplement or distribution of the Form S-4 will be made, and no
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will be made, in each case without providing Purchaser and the Company a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Purchaser, or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by the Company or Purchaser which should be set forth on an
amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be included therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party
hereto and

 



58  an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly prepared and, to the extent required by applicable Law, filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company or Purchaser, as
applicable. The parties shall notify each other promptly of the time when the

any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of (i) all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Form S-4 or the Merger and (ii) all orders of
the SEC relating to the Form S-4. Each of the parties shall use its reasonable
best efforts to respond to any comments on the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or requests for additional
information from the SEC as soon as practicable after receipt of any such
comments or requests. Before responding to any such comments or requests or
the filing or mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form
S-4, as the case may be, each of the parties (x) shall provide the other party
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any drafts of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 (including any amendments or
supplements thereto) and related correspondence and filings and (y) shall
include in such drafts, correspondence and filings all comments reasonably
proposed by the other party.

 

SECTION 6.03. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, from and after the date hereof
until the earlier of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, the Company shall afford to Purchaser, and
to Purchasers officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors
and other Representatives, reasonable access (including for the purpose of
planning for post-merger integration activities and transition planning with
the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries) during normal business
hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company to all its and its
Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records
as Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request, but only to the extent
that such access does not unreasonably disrupt, impair or interfere with
the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and, during
such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Purchaser all information
concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as
Purchaser may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that no access or
information pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement; and,
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Company shall not be required to (or to
cause any of its Subsidiaries to) afford such access or furnish such copies or
other information to the extent that doing so would (x) violate applicable Law
or any obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party (provided, that
in the case of any such confidentiality obligations, the Company shall have
used its reasonable best efforts to

 



59  have obtained the consent of such third party to such access, copies or
information), or result in the loss of attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or similar privilege. Purchaser shall hold any such copies or
information provided pursuant to this Section 6.03(a) that is non-public in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions
of the letter agreement dated December 10, 2009, as amended on August 1, 2011
between Purchaser and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which
Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

 

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give any party, directly or
indirectly, any rights to control or direct the operations of the other party
or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, each party shall, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, exercise complete control and supervision over the operations of
such party and its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 6.04. _Company No Solicitation; Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_. (a) (i) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
person conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any
Company Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) and request the prompt return
or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to such
person in connection with such Company Acquisition Proposal in accordance
with the terms of any confidentiality or similar agreement between the Company
and any such person. From the date hereof until the earlier of (A) the
Effective Time and (B) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01, and except as expressly permitted by Section 6.04(b), the Company
covenants and agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective directors or officers shall, and the Company shall instruct
and use reasonable best efforts to cause any of its or its Subsidiaries
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making or consummation of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a
Company Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide to any person any
non-public information or data in connection with, or otherwise knowingly
cooperate in any way with, any Company Acquisition Proposal, except to notify
such person of its obligations under this Section 6.04, or (C) otherwise
knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make a Company Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall notify the officers, directors and other
Representatives of it and its Subsidiaries of the restrictions imposed by the
preceding sentence and instruct them, and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause them, to comply with those restrictions, and any failure by any of them
to so comply shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.04(a)(i), following
the receipt of a Company Acquisition Proposal that was made after the date
hereof in circumstances not otherwise involving a

 



60  material breach of this Section 6.04, and prior to the time, but not after,
the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company may in response to
such Company Acquisition Proposal, and subject to material compliance with
Section 6.04(c), (A) provide non-public information in response to a request
therefor by the person that has made the Company Acquisition Proposal if the
Company receives from the person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement in customary form and with terms no less restrictive
in the aggregate to the person than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and provides to Purchaser prior to or contemporaneously with the
delivery of such information to such person a copy of all such material
information that was not previously provided to Purchaser, (B) request
information from the person making such Company Acquisition Proposal for the
sole purpose of the board of directors of the Company informing itself about
the Company Acquisition Proposal that has been made and the person that made
it and (C) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with the
person who has made the Company Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the
extent that before taking any of the actions described in the preceding
clauses (A) or (C) above, the board of directors of the Company (1) determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisor) that, in light of the terms and conditions of such Company
Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement, it is necessary to take such action
in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law and (2) also determines in good faith based
on the information then available (after consultation with its financial
advisor) that such Company Acquisition Proposal either is a Company Superior
Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Company Superior Proposal.

(b) Except as expressly permitted by, and after material compliance with,
Section 6.04(c), neither the board of directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall (i) (A) qualify or modify in any manner adverse to
Purchaser or withhold or withdraw, (B) resolve to or make or cause to be made
any public statement proposing or announcing an intention to modify or qualify
in any manner adverse to Purchaser or to withhold or withdraw or (C) fail to
publicly affirm upon Purchasers request as promptly as practicable (but in
any event within five (5) Business Days) after receipt or a public
announcement of a Company Acquisition Proposal (or if the Outside Date is less
than five (5) Business Days from the receipt of such request from Purchaser,
by the close of business on the penultimate Business Day preceding the Outside
Date), the Company Board Recommendation (which request may only be made once
with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal absent further material
changes in such Company Acquisition Proposal, and then only once following
such material change); (ii) make any other public statement in connection with
the Company Stockholders Meeting that is inconsistent with the Company
Board Recommendation; (iii) approve, adopt, recommend or resolve or publicly
propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any Company Acquisition Proposal (any
action described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) being referred to as a "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or (iv) cause or permit the
Company

 



61  or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other
similar Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 6.04(a)(i) entered into in compliance with 6.04(a)(i)) (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to, or that is intended to or
could reasonably be expected to lead to any, Company Acquisition Proposal. Any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change in any respect the
approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the board of directors of
the Company with respect to this Agreement, the Merger, the Subsequent Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including any change that
would have the effect of causing any state (including Delaware)
corporate takeover statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger and the Subsequent
Mergers).

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including Section
6.04(b), the board of directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (i) in response to, or as a result of, an event,
development, occurrence, or change in circumstances or facts, occurring or
arising after the date hereof, which event, development, occurrence, or
circumstances or facts did not exist or was not actually known,
appreciated or understood by the board of directors of the Company as of the
date hereof (other than a Company Superior Proposal) (a " _Company Intervening
Event_ ") or (ii) in response to a Company Superior Proposal made in
material compliance with this Section 6.04, (x) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(h), and concurrently enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Company Superior Proposal if, and only if, prior to taking
any such action, the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after taking into account the advice of its outside legal counsel and
after consultation with its financial advisor, that in light of such Company
Intervening Event or such Company Superior Proposal, if this Agreement was not
amended, it would be necessary to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h), as the case may be,
in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law; (3) the Company delivers to Purchaser a
written notice stating that the board of directors of the Company intends to
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(h), as the case may be, specifying in reasonable
detail the reasons therefor, including a copy of such Alternative Acquisition
Agreement and any related documents or a description in reasonable detail of
such Company Intervening Event, as the case may be; (4) the Company shall have
made its Representatives reasonably available for the five (5) Business Day
period in advance (the " _Negotiation Period_ "), for the purpose of engaging
in negotiations with Purchaser (to the extent Purchaser desires to negotiate)
regarding a possible amendment of this Agreement as would permit the Company,
in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law, not to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h),
as the case may be; and (5) any written proposal made by Purchaser to

 



62  amend this Agreement during the Negotiation Period shall have been
considered by the board of directors of the Company in good faith, and, after
the expiration of the Negotiation Period, the board of directors of the
Company shall have determined in good faith that (A) in the event the
determination of the board of directors of the Company in this Section 6.04(c)
is in response to a Company Superior Proposal, after taking into account the
advice of its outside legal counsel and after consultation with its financial
advisor, that such Company Superior Proposal still constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal and after taking into account the advice of its outside
legal counsel, in light of such Company Superior Proposal, it would be
necessary to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate the
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h) to comply with its fiduciary obligations
to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, in the event of any amendment to the financial or other material terms
of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver to
Purchaser a new written notice (including as attachments thereto a copy of
the new Alternative Acquisition Agreement relating to such amended Company
Acquisition Proposal and copies of any related documents), and the Negotiation
Period shall be extended by an additional three (3) Business Days from the
date of Purchasers receipt of such new written notice and (B) in the event
the determination of the board of directors of the Company in this Section
6.04(c) is in response to a Company Intervening Event, after taking into
account the advice of its outside legal counsel, in light of such Company
Intervening Event, it would be necessary to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change to comply with its fiduciary obligations to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(d) In addition, during the period from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01, the Company shall not terminate, amend, modify or
waive any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement
related to a possible Company Acquisition Proposal entered into by the Company
or its Subsidiary prior to the date of this Agreement.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement: (i) the term " _Company Acquisition
Proposal_ " means any of the following actions or any proposal, offer, inquiry
or indication of interest, whether in written form or otherwise (including
any proposal or offer from or to the Companys stockholders) from any person
or group relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any of
the following actions: (i) any direct or indirect sale, lease, license or
outsourcing, exchange, transfer, disposition not made in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, of any assets (including Equity Securities of any
Subsidiary of the Company), rights, properties, services or businesses that
constitute or contribute 15% or more of the Companys consolidated revenues,
net income or total assets or 15% or more of the total voting power of Equity
Securities of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) any tender offer or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in any person or group beneficially
owning 15% or more of the total voting power of Equity Securities of
the Company, or (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization,

 



63  reorganization, issuance or amendment of securities, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the consummation of which any
person or group (other than the stockholders of the Company immediately prior
to such consummation) would beneficially own, directly or indirectly, (A) 15%
or more of the total voting power of Equity Securities of the Company or of
any successor to, or parent company of, the Company or (B) any assets
(including Equity Securities of any Subsidiary of the Company), rights,
properties or businesses that constitute or contribute 15% or more of the
Companys and all of its Subsidiaries consolidated revenues, net income or
total assets, taken as a whole, in each case other than the transactions
pursuant to this Agreement; and

 

(ii) the term " _Company Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited, bona fide
written Company Acquisition Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the
definition of such term changed from 20% to 50%) which the board of directors
of the Company has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, would result in a
transaction (x) more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial
point of view than the Merger, taking into account all relevant factors
(including all terms and conditions of such offer and this Agreement
(including those changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Purchaser
in response to such proposal or otherwise)) and (y) is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such offer; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "Company Superior Proposal" if
any financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such
offer is not committed and, in the good faith judgment of the board of
directors of the Company after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, is not reasonably capable of being obtained by such third
party. 

(f) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a),
(b), (c) and (d) of this Section 6.04, the Company shall as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt) notify Purchaser
orally and in writing if any Company Acquisition Proposal is received by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
and the material terms and conditions of any such Company Acquisition Proposal
(including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall (x) keep Purchaser fully informed on
a current basis (which shall be considered in light of the circumstances of
such Company Acquisition Proposal and the time by which the Company has the
opportunity to respond) of the status and material details (including any
change to the material terms thereof) of any Company Acquisition Proposal and
(y) provide to Purchaser as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery
thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or
provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any person that
describes any of the terms or conditions of any Alternative Acquisition
Agreements.

 



64 (g) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to, and in accordance
with, Section 8.01, (i) the obligation of the Company to establish a record
date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting and to hold a vote of the Companys stockholders on the adoption of
this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to Section 6.01
shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to it of any Company Acquisition Proposal (whether
or not a Company Superior Proposal), or by a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, and (ii) in any case in which the Company makes a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 6.04, the Company shall
nevertheless submit this Agreement to a vote of its stockholders at the
Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement.

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 6.04 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company from complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or
state Law with regard to a Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such disclosure does not reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation and has the substantive effect of withholding, withdrawing,
modifying or qualifying in any manner adverse to the Purchaser Board
Recommendation, then such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in Section 8.01(e); _provided_ , _further_ , that, for
purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by the
Company that merely describes the Companys receipt of a Company Acquisition
Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, any
statement to the effect that the Company Acquisition Proposal is under
consideration by the board of directors of the Company or any "stop, look and
listen" communication by the board of directors of the Company pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act or any similar communication to its
stockholders, shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

SECTION 6.05. _Purchaser No Solicitation; Purchaser Adverse Recommendation
Change_. (a) (i) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
person conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any
Purchaser Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) and request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to
such person in connection with such Purchaser Acquisition Proposal in
accordance with the terms of any confidentiality or similar agreement between
Purchaser and any such person. From the date hereof until the earlier of (A)
the date that the Purchaser Stockholder Vote is obtained and (B) termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 (the " _Purchaser No-Shop Period_
") and except as expressly permitted by Section 6.05(b), Purchaser covenants
and agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective directors or officers shall, and Purchaser shall instruct and use
reasonable best efforts to cause any of its or its Subsidiaries respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making or consummation of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a
Purchaser Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise 

 



65  participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide to any
person any non-public information or data in connection with, or otherwise
knowingly cooperate in any way with, any Purchaser Acquisition Proposal,
except to notify such person of its obligations under this Section 6.05, or
(C) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make a Purchaser
Acquisition Proposal. Purchaser shall notify the officers, directors and
other Representatives of it and its Subsidiaries of the restrictions imposed
by the preceding sentence and instruct them, and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause them, to comply with those restrictions, and any failure by
any of them to so comply shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by
Purchaser.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.05(a)(i),
following the receipt of a Purchaser Acquisition Proposal that was made after
the date hereof in circumstances not otherwise involving a material breach of
this Section 6.05, Purchaser may in response to such Purchaser Acquisition
Proposal, (A) provide non-public information in response to a request therefor
by the person that has made the written Purchaser Acquisition Proposal if
Purchaser receives from the person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement in customary form and with terms no less restrictive
in the aggregate to the person than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, (B) request information from the person making such Purchaser
Acquisition Proposal for the sole purpose of the board of directors of
Purchaser informing itself about the Purchaser Acquisition Proposal that has
been made and the person that made it, and (C) engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with the person who has made the Purchaser
Acquisition Proposal if and only to the extent that before taking any of the
actions described in the preceding clauses (A) or (C) above, the board of
directors of Purchaser (1) determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that, in light of the terms
and conditions of such Purchaser Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement, it
is necessary to take such action in order to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to Purchasers stockholders under applicable Law and (2) also
determines in good faith based on the information then available (after
consultation with its financial advisor) that such Purchaser Acquisition
Proposal either is a Purchaser Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to
result in a Purchaser Superior Proposal.

(b) Except as expressly permitted by, and after material compliance with,
Section 6.05(c), until the expiration of the Purchaser No-Shop Period, neither
the board of directors of Purchaser nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
qualify or modify in any manner adverse to the Company or withhold or withdraw
or (B) resolve to or make or cause to be made any public statement proposing
or announcing an intention to qualify or modify in any manner adverse to the
Company or to withhold or withdraw or (C) fail to publicly affirm upon the
Companys request as promptly as practicable (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days) after receipt or a public announcement of a Purchaser
Acquisition Proposal (or if the Outside Date is less than five (5) Business
Days from the receipt of such request from the Company, by the close of
business on the 

 



66  penultimate Business Day preceding the Outside Date), the Purchaser Board
Recommendation (which request may only be made once with respect to such
Purchaser Acquisition Proposal absent further material changes in such
Purchaser Acquisition Proposal, and then only once following such material
change); (ii) make any other public statement in connection with Purchaser
Stockholders Meeting that is inconsistent with Purchaser
Board Recommendation; or (iii) approve, adopt, recommend or resolve or
publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any Purchaser Acquisition
Proposal (any action described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) being referred to
as a " _Purchaser Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Any Purchaser Adverse
Recommendation Change shall not change in any respect the approval of this
Agreement or any other approval of the board of directors of Purchaser with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger, the Subsequent Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including any change that would have the
effect of causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or
other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger and the Subsequent Mergers).

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including Section
6.05(b), the board of directors of Purchaser may (i) make a Purchaser Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to, or as a result of, an event,
development, occurrence, or change in circumstances or facts, occurring or
arising after the date hereof, which event, development, occurrence, or
circumstances or facts did not exist or was not actually known, appreciated or
understood by the board of directors of Purchaser as of the date hereof
(other than a Purchaser Superior Proposal) (a " _Purchaser Intervening Event_
") or (ii) in response to a Purchaser Superior Proposal made in material
compliance with this Section 6.05, (x) make a Purchaser Adverse
Recommendation Change or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(e), and concurrently enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other
similar Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 6.05(a)(i) entered into in compliance with 6.04(a)(i)) (a " _Purchaser
Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") with respect to such Purchaser Superior
Proposal if, and only if, (1) the board of directors of Purchaser determines
in good faith, after taking into account the advice of its outside legal
counsel and after consultation with its financial advisor, that in light of
such Purchaser Intervening Event or such Purchaser Superior Proposal, if this
Agreement was not amended, it would be necessary to make a Purchaser Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(e), as the case may be, in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations
to Purchasers stockholders under applicable Law; and (2) Purchaser delivers
to the Company a written notice stating that the board of directors of
Purchaser intends to effect a Purchaser Adverse Recommendation Change.

(d) In addition, during the Purchaser No-Shop Period Purchaser shall not
terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality,
"standstill" or similar agreement related to a possible Purchaser Acquisition
Proposal entered into by Purchaser or its Subsidiary prior to the date of
this Agreement.

 



67 (i) For purposes of this Agreement: (A) the term " _Purchaser Acquisition
Proposal_ " means any of the following actions or any proposal, offer, inquiry
or indication of interest, whether in written form or otherwise (including any
proposal or offer from or to Purchasers stockholders) from any person or
group relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any of the
following actions: (i) any direct or indirect sale, lease, license or
outsourcing, exchange, transfer, disposition not made in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, of any assets (including Equity Securities of any
Subsidiary of Purchaser), rights, properties, services or businesses that
constitute or contribute 15% or more of Purchasers consolidated revenues,
net income or total assets or 15% or more of the total voting power of Equity
Securities of Purchaser or any Subsidiary, (ii) any tender offer or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in any person or group beneficially
owning 15% or more of the total voting power of Equity Securities of
Purchaser, or (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, reorganization, issuance or amendment of securities,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or similar transaction
involving Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries after the consummation of which
any person or group (other than the stockholders of Purchaser immediately
prior to such consummation) would beneficially own, directly or indirectly,
(A) 15% or more of the total voting power of Equity Securities of Purchaser or
of any successor to, or parent company of, Purchaser or (B) any assets
(including Equity Securities of any Subsidiary of Purchaser), rights,
properties or businesses that constitute 15% or more of Purchasers and all of
its Subsidiaries consolidated net revenues, net income and total assets,
taken as a whole, in each case other than the transactions pursuant to this
Agreement; and

(ii) the term " _Purchaser Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited, bona
fide Purchaser Acquisition Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the
definition of such term changed from 20% to 50%) which the board of directors
of Purchaser has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, would result in a
transaction (x) more favorable to Purchasers stockholders from a financial
point of view than the Merger, taking into account all relevant factors
(including all terms and conditions of such offer and this Agreement
(including those changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Purchaser
in response to such proposal or otherwise)) and (y) is reasonably likely to
be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior
Proposal" if any financing required to consummate the transaction
contemplated by such offer is not committed and, in the good faith judgment of
the board of directors of Purchaser after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, is not reasonably capable of being obtained
by such third party; _provided_ , _further_ , that the board of directors of
Purchaser shall, in evaluating such proposal, take into account, to the extent
it deems relevant, 

 



68  among other things, the long-term prospects of Purchaser following the
consummation of the Merger relative to the consideration to be received by the
stockholders of Purchaser in such offer. 

(e) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to, and in accordance with,
Section 8.01, (i) the obligation of Purchaser to establish a record date for,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold Purchaser Stockholders Meeting and
to hold a vote of Purchasers stockholders on the adoption of this Agreement
at Purchaser Stockholders Meeting pursuant to Section 6.01 shall not be
limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission to it of any Purchaser Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a
Superior Proposal), or by a Purchaser Adverse Recommendation Change, and (ii)
in any case in which Purchaser makes a Purchaser Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this Section 6.05, Purchaser shall nevertheless submit this
Agreement to a vote of its stockholders at Purchaser Stockholders Meeting for
the purpose of adopting this Agreement.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.05 shall be deemed to prohibit
Purchaser from complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or
state Law with regard to a Purchaser Acquisition Proposal; provided, however,
that if such disclosure does not reaffirm Purchaser Board Recommendation and
has the substantive effect of withholding, withdrawing, modifying or
qualifying in any manner adverse to the Purchaser Board Recommendation, then
such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Purchaser Adverse Recommendation
Change and the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as
set forth in Section 8.01(f); _provided, further_ , that, for purposes of this
Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by Purchaser that merely
describes Purchasers receipt of a Purchaser Acquisition Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, any statement to the effect
that the Purchaser Acquisition Proposal is under consideration by the board of
directors of Purchaser or any "stop, look and listen" communication by the
board of directors of Purchaser pursuant to Rule 14d9(f) of the Exchange Act
or any similar communication to its stockholders, shall not constitute a
Purchaser Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

SECTION 6.06. _Financing_ . (a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Closing is
not conditioned upon Purchaser obtaining any financing. Purchaser shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange
the Financing on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the
Financing Commitment (including the "flex" provisions) and shall not permit
any amendment, supplement or modification to be made to, or any waiver
by Purchaser of any provision or remedy under the Financing Commitment
(including definitive agreements related thereto) if such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of
the net cash proceeds of the Financing (as compared to the amount of such
aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Financing Commitment as in effect on
the date hereof) or (ii) impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise
amend, modify or expand any conditions, to the 

 



69  receipt of the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
(I) prevent, impede or delay the funding of the Financing or the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereunder, (II)
adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against other
parties to the Financing Commitment (including definitive agreements related
thereto), provided that Purchaser may replace, amend, supplement or modify
the Financing Commitment to add agents, co-agents, lenders, arrangers, joint
bookrunners, managers or other entities that have not executed the Financing
Commitment as of the date hereof. Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the
Company copies of any such replacement, amendment, supplement, modification or
waiver. For purposes of this Section 6.06(a), references to "Financing" shall
include the debt financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment
as permitted to be amended or modified by this Section 6.06(a) and references
to "Financing Commitment" shall include such documents as permitted to be
amended, modified or substituted by this Section 6.06(a). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and except to the extent Purchaser has
completed an offering of debt securities whose net cash proceeds replace
amounts that were to be provided under the Financing Commitment, which net
cash proceeds have been placed in an escrow account in favor of the
bondholders on customary terms for high yield bond offerings and which will be
available to Purchaser subject solely to conditions precedent that are no more
onerous in any material respect than the conditions precedent contained in
the Financing Commitment that would have been applicable to the replaced
amounts of the Financing, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(w) maintain in effect the Financing Commitment until the Merger,
the Subsequent Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, (x) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
to the Financing Commitment (which with respect to the bridge facilities
documentation shall not be required until reasonably necessary in connection
with the funding of the Financing) on terms and conditions (including "flex"
provisions) no less favorable to Purchaser than those contained in the
Financing Commitment, (y) satisfy (or have waived) all conditions and
covenants applicable to Purchaser in the Financing Commitment that are within
its control at or prior to the Closing, and otherwise comply in all material
respects with its obligations under the Financing Commitment (including
definitive agreements related thereto), and (z) except to the extent Purchaser
otherwise has cash resources at Closing to fund its payment obligations
hereunder taking into account upfront and similar fees payable under the
Financing (including to the extent any "flex" provisions are implemented),
upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment,
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall keep the
Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or replacement
thereof) as the Company may reasonably request, and shall provide the Company
with copies of all definitive documents related to the Financing and, as the
Company may reasonably request from time to time, drafts of such documents
posted to a lender syndicate group; provided that the Fee Letters may be
redacted in accordance with Section 4.12; _provided,_ that in no event will
Purchaser be under any obligation to disclose any information that is subject
to attorney-client or similar privilege if Purchaser shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not

 



70 waive such privilege. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Purchaser shall give the Company prompt notice (x) of any material breach or
default by any party to any of the Financing Commitments or definitive
agreements related to the Financing of which Purchaser becomes aware, (y) of
the receipt of (A) any written notice or (B) other written communication, in
each case from any Financing Source with respect to any (1) material breach of
any of its obligations under the Financing Commitment or default, termination
or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Commitments or definitive
agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the Financing
Commitments or definitive agreements related to the Financing or (2) material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any of the Financing
Commitments or definitive agreements related to the Financing with respect to
the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be
funded at Closing (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Financing or
any definitive agreement with respect thereto), and (z) if at any time for any
reason Purchaser believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or
from the sources contemplated by any of the Financing Commitments or
definitive agreements related to the Financing. As soon as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within two Business Days after the Company
delivers to Purchaser a written request, Purchaser shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence.

(b) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Financing Commitment (including the "flex"
provisions), Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and subject to
conditions that are not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to
Purchaser than those set forth in the Financing Commitment, in an amount
sufficient, when combined with cash on hand and borrowings under any existing
credit facilities or other financing arrangements, to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable after the occurrence of such event. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, Purchaser shall have the right from
time to time to substitute other debt financing for all or any portion of the
Financing from the same and/or alternative financing source; _provided_ , that
any such substitution shall not expand upon in any material respect the
conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding on the "Closing Date" of
the Financing as set forth in the Financing Commitment in effect on the date
hereof or reasonably be expected to cause any delay of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby. In such event, the term "Financing
Commitment" as used herein shall be deemed to include the new commitment
letter (the " _New Financing Commitment_ "), if any, entered into in
accordance with this Section 6.06(b) (any financing arranged under this
Section 6.06(b) shall be referred to as the " _Alternate Financing_ ").
Purchaser will provide the Company with a copy of any New Financing Commitment
obtained by Purchaser in connection with an Alternate Financing as promptly
as practicable following the execution thereof (other than fees and other
information redacted from such agreements that is consistent with the
information

 



71  redacted from the Fee Letters as permitted by Section 4.12). In the event
that (x) all or any portion of the Financing contemplated to be raised in lieu
of the bridge financing contemplated under the Financing Commitment has not
been consummated, (y) all closing conditions contained in Article VII shall
have been satisfied or waived (and which are, at the time of the termination
of this Agreement, capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur at
such time) and (z) the bridge facilities contemplated by the Financing
Commitments are available on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Commitments, then Purchaser shall draw down on such bridge
financing, in an amount sufficient and to the extent necessary, when combined
with cash on hand and borrowings under any existing credit facilities or other
financing arrangements, to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, at the Closing. In the event that (x) the
ABL Facility has not been amended as contemplated by the Financing Commitment,
(y) all closing conditions contained in Article VII shall have been satisfied
or waived (and which are, at the time of the termination of this Agreement,
capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such time) and (z)
the Replacement ABL Facility (or alternative financing obtained in accordance
with this Section 6.06(b)) is available on the terms and conditions described
in the Financing Commitments), then Purchaser shall draw down on such
Replacement ABL Facility, in an amount sufficient and to the extent necessary,
when combined with cash on hand and borrowings under any existing credit
facilities or other financing arrangements, to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, at the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in
this Section 6.06 shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best
efforts of Purchaser be deemed or construed to require, Purchaser to (i) bring
any enforcement action, including commencing or filing any Action, against
any source of the Financing to enforce its rights under the Financing
Commitment or (ii) pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by the
Financing Commitment (whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained
therein or otherwise); _provided_ , that Purchaser shall pay all fees
required by the Financing Commitment as they become due.

(c) The Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) provide to
Purchaser, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause Representatives of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide to Purchaser, on a timely basis,
all cooperation in connection with the arrangement and syndication of the
Financing (including the marketing efforts in connection therewith) and the
repayment of any indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser, including by (i) providing reasonable
cooperation with the marketing efforts of Purchaser and lenders or initial
purchasers for any of the Financing, including using reasonable best efforts
to cause its Representatives (including senior management and advisors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries) to be available, during normal working hours and
upon reasonable notice, to participate in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, and
sessions with rating agencies, and using its commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that any syndication efforts benefit from any existing Company
banking relationships, (ii) assisting with the preparation of
customary materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents,
private placement

 



72  memoranda, bank information memoranda (to the extent relating to the Company
and its Subsidiaries), registration statements, prospectuses, road show
presentations and similar documents reasonably necessary or advisable in
connection with the Financing and offering of equity securities of Purchaser
contemplated hereby, including the preparation and furnishing in a timely
fashion of all financial statements and other data customary to be included
in connection therewith (including all audited financial statements, all
unaudited financial statements (which shall have been reviewed by the
independent accountants for the Company as provided in the procedures
specified by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in AU 722) and all
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably required for
the Purchaser to prepare pro forma financial statements, financial data, audit
reports and other information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries of
the type required by and in compliance with Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and related forms
and all information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably
necessary for the preparation of financial projections and a financial model
for the Purchaser after giving effect to the Merger (A) for a registered
public offering of debt securities, and of type and form customarily included
in private placements of debt securities under Rule 144A, to consummate the
offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by the Financing Commitment and
(B) for the syndication of bridge loan commitments and facilities and asset
based loan commitments and facilities contemplated under the Financing
Commitment, (iii) assist with the preparation of definitive financing
documents and provide Financing Sources with reasonable access to the
properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries during
normal working hours (to the extent practicable) and upon reasonable notice,
(iv) using commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Companys independent
auditors to provide, consistent with customary practice, (A) consent to SEC
filings and offering memoranda that include or incorporate the Companys
consolidated financial information and their reports thereon, in each case, to
the extent such consent is required, customary auditors reports and customary
comfort letters (including "negative assurance" comfort) with respect to
financial information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, (B)
reasonable assistance in the preparation of pro forma financial statements by
Purchaser and (C) provide reasonable assistance and cooperation to Purchaser,
including attending accounting due diligence sessions, (v) providing financial
and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries
reasonably requested, including unaudited monthly financial statements for the
Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (excluding footnotes), to
the extent the Company customarily prepares such financial statements,
within the time frame such statements are prepared, (vi) providing and
executing documents as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser (excluding
legal opinions and solvency certificates); (vii) using reasonable best efforts
to permit the Financing Sources and other prospective lenders involved in the
Financing to evaluate the Companys current assets, cash management and
accounting system, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose of
establishing collateral arrangements as of the Closing, including account
control agreements, (viii) reasonably cooperating with the Financing Sources
and their respective agents with respect to their due diligence, including by
giving access to documentation reasonably requested by persons in

 



73 connection with capital markets transactions, (ix) furnishing Purchaser and
the Financing Sources promptly with all documentation and other information
required by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Financing under
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the PATRIOT Act, and in any event at least five (5)
days prior to the Closing Date, (x) providing customary authorization letters
to the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of information to
prospective lenders, (xi) arranging for customary payoff letters, lien
terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at Closing providing
for the payoff, discharge and termination on the Closing Date of all
indebtedness of the Company or any of its subsidiaries contemplated by
the Financing Commitment to be paid off, discharged and terminated on the
Closing Date (subject to receipt from Purchaser of the funds necessary to
effectuate the pay off contemplated by such payoff letters, lien terminations
and instruments of discharge) and using commercially reasonable efforts to
assist Purchaser in obtaining opinions of local counsel to the Company or any
of its subsidiaries to the extent reasonably requested by Purchaser to effect
the Financing, (xii) facilitating the execution and delivery at the Closing
of definitive documents related to the Financing on the terms contemplated by
the Financing Commitment, (xiii) to the extent reasonably requested by the
Purchaser, causing the taking of corporate actions (subject to the occurrence
of the Closing) by the Company and its subsidiaries reasonably necessary to
permit the completion of the Financing and (xiv) using commercially reasonable
efforts to assist in delivery of inventory appraisals and field audits. The
Company hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the syndication or marketing of the Financing,
provided that such logos are not used in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to harm or disparage the Company, its Subsidiaries or their marks.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.06(c), neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to undertake any
obligation or execute any agreement (other than authorization letters in
connection with syndication efforts) that would be effective prior to the
Effective Time, or deliver, or cause to be delivered, any legal opinion by its
counsel (other than by using commercially reasonable efforts to assist
Purchaser in obtaining local counsel opinions). In addition, the Company and
its Subsidiaries will reasonably cooperate and provide information and
assistance reasonably requested by Purchaser in order for Purchaser to
increase availability under its receivables facility and asset-based credit
facility at Closing to take into account receivables, equipment and other
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including assisting lenders under
those facilities in related diligence, and cooperating with Purchaser in
taking steps needed to create and perfect security over such assets, effective
on the Closing Date. Except to the extent contemplated hereunder,
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Company and its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives shall not have any responsibility for (or,
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing), incur
any liability to any person under or in connection with, the arrangement of
the Financing or any alternative financing that Purchaser may raise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser
shall (x) promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in

 



74 connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
contemplated by this Section 6.06(c) and (y) indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all Costs suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing or any alternative financing and any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided in writing
by the Company or its Subsidiaries expressly for use in connection therewith).

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
condition set forth in Section 7.02(b), as it applies to the Companys
obligations under Section 6.06(c), shall be deemed satisfied unless the
Companys breach(es) of its obligations under Section 6.06(c) materially
contributed to the failure to close the Financing or Alternative Financing.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the
first period of 20 consecutive calendar days after the date of this Agreement
commencing on the date on which and throughout which period (A) Purchaser
shall have the Required Information and such Required Information is Compliant
and (B) the conditions set forth in Sections 7.01(a), (b) and (e) (the "
_Specified Conditions_ ") and 7.02(b) shall be satisfied assuming the Closing
were to be scheduled for any time during such 20 consecutive calendar day
period (except in the case of the condition set forth in Section 7.02(b), to
the extent such condition relates to covenants to be performed at the Closing
or at any other time after any applicable time during such 20 consecutive
calendar day period) after the date hereof and nothing has occurred and no
conditions exist that would cause, or would reasonably be expected to cause,
any of the other conditions set forth in Sections 7.01 and 7.02 to fail to be
satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such
20 consecutive calendar day period; _provided_ , that (i) if the Marketing
Period would otherwise have commenced on August 16 or August 26, 2012, as the
case may be, but for the failure of the Specified Conditions to have been met
on such date, then the Marketing Period shall be deemed to have commenced on
such dates for purposes of this Agreement if the Specified Conditions are met
not later than September 1, 2012, and the other requirements of the Marketing
Period are met throughout the required 20 or 30 consecutive calendar day
period, as appropriate, (ii) the 20 consecutive calendar day period referred
to in this Section 6.06(e) shall be extended to a 30 consecutive calendar day
period if the Purchaser notifies the Company no later than 30 calendar days
prior to the date that the Marketing Period would otherwise commence hereunder
that the Purchaser reasonably expects to need to market and syndicate an
asset based loan facility as referred to in Section 3(e) of Exhibit F of the
Financing Commitment, and (iii) if the Marketing Period has not ended prior to
August 7, 2012, the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to have
commenced until August 16, 2012 (if a 30 calendar day Marketing Period
applies) or August 26, 2012 (if a 20 calendar day Marketing Period applies)
for any purpose hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the
Purchaser does not have the Required Information or the Required Information
is not Compliant throughout and on the last day of such period, then a new 20
or 30 consecutive calendar day period, as appropriate, shall commence 

 



75  upon Purchaser receiving updated Required Information that is Compliant.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and applicable Law, Purchaser may
commence its marketing of the offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by
the Financing Commitment at any time after the date of this Agreement. If at
any time the Company shall in good faith reasonably believe that it has
provided all Required Information as required by clause (A) of the first
sentence of this definition and that such Required Information is Compliant,
it may deliver to Purchaser a written notice to that effect (stating the date
it believes such Required Information was provided), in which case the Company
shall be deemed to have complied with such clause (A) above unless Purchaser
in good faith reasonably believes the Company has not provided all Required
Information or that such Required Information is not Compliant and, within
five (5) Business Days after the delivery of such notice, delivers a written
notice to the Company to that effect, stating with specificity, to the extent

Financing Commitment as in effect on the date hereof (solely to the extent
related to the Company and its Subsidiaries) and other pertinent information

information, in each case (A) for (i) a registration statement for
a registered public offering of debt securities of the type contemplated by
the Financing Commitment to be declared effective, and of the type and form
customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A, to consummate the
offering of debt securities contemplated by the Financing Commitment and (ii)

order to receive customary "comfort" letters with respect to the financial
statements and data referred to in clause (i) of this definition (including

(g) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties in Article
III and performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement,

securities in lieu thereof), to fund the Cash Portion of the Purchase Price,

which historical financial statements are included) on any date during the
Marketing Period or the Required Information Period, as applicable, and (ii)
the auditors that have reviewed or audited such financial information have
delivered drafts of customary comfort letters, including customary negative
assurance comfort, and such auditors have confirmed they are prepared to
issue such comfort letter upon any pricing date relating to the Financing
occurring during the Marketing Period or the Required Information Period, as
applicable. " _Required Information Period_ " means the 20 calendar day
period referred to in Section 2(a) of Exhibit F of the Financing Commitment.

SECTION 6.07.  _Further Action; Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to use its reasonable best
efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate and make
effective the Merger, the Subsequent Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable. Each party agrees to
(i) as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and in any
event no later than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement, make
(and, without the prior written consent of the other party to this Agreement,
not withdraw) (A) appropriate filings of Notification and Report Forms
pursuant to the HSR Act and

 



77 (B) an appropriate filing of a Notification pursuant to Part IX of the
Competition Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
use reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all other
Consents of or by any Governmental Entity that are necessary or advisable
under or in respect of any Antitrust Laws in order to consummate the Merger,
the Subsequent Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Antitrust Consents_ ") and (iii) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all other
Consents of or by any Governmental Entity or third party that are necessary or
required in order to consummate the Merger, the Subsequent Mergers or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, subject to the following sentence, nothing in this Section
6.07 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require,
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
to (A) (1) sell, lease, license, transfer, dispose of, divest or otherwise
encumber, or to hold separate pending any such action or (2) proffer, propose,
negotiate, offer to effect or consent, commit or agree to any
sale, divestiture, lease, licensing, transfer, disposal, divestment or other
encumbrance of, or to hold separate, in each case before or after the
Effective Time any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interest of Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or (B) take or agree to take any other action, or
agree or consent to any limitations or restrictions on freedom of actions with
respect to, or its ability to own, retain or make changes in, any assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interests of
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
or Purchasers ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends or otherwise
exercise full ownership rights with respect to the stock of the Surviving
Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately
preceding sentence, Purchaser shall agree to sell, transfer, dispose of or
otherwise divest, or hold separate or otherwise subject to any restriction or
limitation, any of the assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interest of Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries that constitute or contribute in the aggregate no more than 10%
of the consolidated revenues of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof if any such sale, divestiture, transfer, disposal or other divestment,
or holding separate, restriction or limitation, is necessary in order to
obtain the Antitrust Consents so that the Closing shall occur as promptly as
practicable, and in any event, prior to June 15, 2012 (unless the Outside Date
shall have been extended pursuant to the terms hereof and if so prior to the
end of the extended Outside Date); _provided,_ that Purchaser shall determine,
(x) in its sole discretion (but solely to the extent that reasonable
alternatives exist with respect to its choice of remedies) and (y) in
its reasonable discretion (in all other scenarios), the assets, licenses,
operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest of Purchaser, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to be so sold, transferred,
disposed of, divested, held separate or subject to any restriction or
limitation; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this Section 6.07(a)
shall obligate Purchaser to agree to any such sale, divestiture, lease,
licensing, transfer, disposal, divestment or other encumbrance of, or holding
separate, not conditioned on the consummation of the Merger, the Subsequent
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that
shall take effect prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this

 



78  Section 6.07, if requested by Purchaser in writing, the Company shall agree
to take any of the actions referred to above if they are effective only after
the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not agree
to any conditions, limitations, requirements or other restrictions described
in clauses (A) or (B) above without the prior written consent of Purchaser. If
(i) the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") issues a request for
additional information and documentary material (a " _Second Request_ ")
under the HSR Act or (ii) the Commissioner of Competition or his/her
designated representative(s) (the " _Commissioner_ ") issues a supplemental
information request (a " _SIR_ ") pursuant to S.114(2) of the Competition
Act, in either case in relation to the Merger, the Subsequent Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and
Purchaser shall take all such measures as may be reasonably necessary to
limit the scope of such Second Request or SIR, use its reasonable best efforts
to certify substantial compliance with such Second Request or SIR as promptly
as practicable and otherwise to respond to and seek to resolve any requests
for information, documents, data or testimony made by the FTC or the DOJ under
the HSR Act or the Commissioner under the Competition Act. Each party shall
supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and the Competition
Act and shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and the Competition Act as
promptly as practicable.

(b) Subject to Sections 6.07(a) and 6.07(d), each of Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall in connection with the
reasonable best efforts referenced in Section 6.07(a) to obtain all requisite
Consents for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR
Act or any other Antitrust Law (i) cooperate in all respects with each other
in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) keep the other party and/or its counsel informed on a
current basis of any communication received by such party from, or given by
such party to, the FTC, DOJ, the Commissioner or any other U.S. or foreign
Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) permit the other party and/or its
counsel to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each
other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC, the
Commissioner or any such other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and to the extent not
prohibited by the DOJ, the FTC, the Commissioner or such other Governmental
Entity or other person, give the other party and/or its counsel the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

 

(c) Subject to Sections 6.07(a) and 6.07(d), in the event that any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated
hereby, each of Purchaser and the 

 



79  Company shall (i) cooperate in all respects with each other and use its
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as
to permit such consummation no later than the third Business Day before the
Outside Date, and (ii) defend, at its cost and expense, any such actions or
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, against it or its Affiliates
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to the matters covered in this Section 6.07, it is agreed that Purchaser,
after consulting with the Company and considering the Companys views in good
faith, shall make all decisions, lead all discussions, negotiations and
other proceedings, and coordinate all activities with respect to any requests
that may be made by, or any actions, consents, undertakings, approvals, or
waivers that may be sought by or from, any Governmental Entity, including
determining the manner in which to contest or otherwise respond, by
litigation or otherwise, to objections to, or proceedings or other actions
challenging, the consummation of the Merger, the Subsequent Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that Purchaser
shall give the Company the opportunity to participate in such discussions,
negotiations or other proceedings to the extent not prohibited by applicable
Law. At Purchasers request and expense, the Company agrees to take all
reasonable actions Purchaser reasonably deems prudent in order to reasonably
assist Purchaser in obtaining any actions, consents, undertakings, approvals
or waivers by or from any Governmental Entity for or in connection with, and
to reasonably assist Purchaser in litigating or otherwise contesting any
objections to or proceedings or other actions challenging, the consummation of
the Merger, the Subsequent Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company shall not permit any of its Representatives to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation, proceeding or other matters related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby unless the Company consults with
Purchaser in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives Purchaser the opportunity to attend and lead the discussions at such
meeting. The Company agrees that, at the sole discretion and direction
of Purchaser (and at Purchasers expense), it shall agree to any and all
divestitures or other remedies relating to itself or any of its Subsidiaries
that are necessary to obtain the Antitrust Consents; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this Section 6.07(d) shall obligate the Company to agree to
any such divestiture or any other remedy not conditioned on the consummation
of the Merger, the Subsequent Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement where such divestiture or other remedy would involve any
cost to the Company that is not reimbursed by Purchaser.

SECTION 6.08. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a)
From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser agrees that it will indemnify and
hold harmless each individual that, as of the Effective Time, is a present
or former director or

 



80  officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, to the
extent they acted in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_
"), from and against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred by such individual in such capacity in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise),
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted under Delaware Law, the Company Charter and the
Company Bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, to
indemnify such individual (and Purchaser shall also advance expenses as
incurred by such individual in connection therewith to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided,_ that such individual provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
individual is not entitled to indemnification); _provided_ , _however_ , that
any determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified
Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under applicable Law,
the Company Charter and/or the Company Bylaws shall be made by independent
counsel selected by Purchaser. 

(b) Subject to Section 6.08(e), any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 6.08 with respect to any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Purchaser of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation promptly after becoming
aware thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Purchaser of
any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such
failure actually prejudices Purchaser. In the event of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), (i) Purchaser shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof at its expense with counsel selected by the independent directors of
Purchaser and Purchaser shall not be liable to the Indemnified Parties for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred
by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except
that if Purchaser elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties reasonably advises that there are issues which raise
conflicts of interest between Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Indemnified
Parties, on the other hand, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them and Purchaser shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor
are received; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing
Purchaser shall not be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for
more than one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction
unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such
counsel with a conflict of interest, in which case Purchaser shall only be
obligated to pay for the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid such
conflicts of interest, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will reasonably cooperate
in the defense of any such matter and (iii) Purchaser shall not be liable for
any settlement effected without its prior written consent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that

 



81  notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited or not permitted by applicable Law, the
Company Charter and/or the Company Bylaws, in each case as in effect as of
the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any claim, action suit,
proceeding or investigation pending or threatened in writing to which an
Indemnified Party is a party (and in respect of which indemnification is
being sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such claim, action suit, proceeding
or investigation.

(c) Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the Indemnified Parties may
have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or
insurance provided by other persons. Purchaser hereby agrees that (i)
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation are the indemnitor of first resort
(i.e., their obligations to the Indemnified Parties are primary and any
obligation of such other Persons to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by any such
Indemnified Party are secondary), (ii) Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred
by any such Indemnified Party and shall be liable for the full indemnifiable
amounts, without regard to any rights any such Indemnified Party may have
against any such other person and (iii) Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation irrevocably waive, relinquish and release such other Persons from
any and all claims against any such other persons for contribution,
subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. Each of
Purchaser and Surviving Corporation further agrees that no advancement or
payment by any of such other persons on behalf of any such Indemnified Party
with respect to any claim for which such Indemnified Party has sought
indemnification from the Surviving Corporation shall affect the foregoing and
such other persons shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to
the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of
such Indemnified Party against the Surviving Corporation.

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, any other indemnification
agreement or arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. In the event that Purchaser
or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties, rights and other assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, Purchaser shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Purchaser shall expressly assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.08.

 



82 (e) For six years after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall maintain (directly
or indirectly through the Companys existing insurance programs) in effect
the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance (providing
only for the Side A Coverage for Indemnified Parties where the existing
policies include Side B coverage for the Company) in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person
currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy (a complete and accurate copy of which has been heretofore
delivered to Purchaser), on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no
less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may (i) substitute
therefor policies of Purchaser containing terms with respect to coverage
(including as coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) and amounts no
less favorable to such directors and officers or (ii) obtain one or more
"tail" policies for all or any portion of the full six-year period; _provided_
, _further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Purchaser
be required to expend in the aggregate an annual premium amount for
directors and officers liability insurance pursuant to this Section 6.08(d)
in excess of 250% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for its
current directors and officers liability insurance; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, Purchaser shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.08 are expressly intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable from and after the Effective Time by,
each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract
or otherwise.

SECTION 6.09. _Public Announcements_. Purchaser and the Company (i) shall
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity
to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger and the Subsequent Mergers and (ii) shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
in the case of clause (ii) only as such party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with the NYSE. The parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed between the parties. 

SECTION 6.10. _Stockholder Actions_. Each Party shall promptly notify the
other party in writing of any stockholder litigation related to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that is brought, or, to the Knowledge of the Company or Purchaser (as
applicable), threatened in writing, against the Company or Purchaser and/or
the members of its respective board of directors prior to the Effective Time
and shall keep such other party reasonably informed with respect to the status
thereof. The Company shall consult with Purchaser with respect to, and shall 

 



83  provide Purchaser with the opportunity to participate in (but not control
the defense or settlement of) any stockholder litigation against the Company
and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Purchasers prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

SECTION 6.11. _Employee Matters_.

(a) With respect to each employee benefit plan or program or service-based
policy maintained by Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates
following the Effective Time and in which any of the employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Employees_ ") who continue to be employed
by Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates after the
Effective Time, excluding any employees who are covered by a collective
bargaining agreement (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), participate after the
Effective Time (the " _Purchaser Plans_ "), for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accrual (but not with respect
to calculation or accrual of benefits under any defined benefit program),
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Company and its Subsidiaries provide
past service credit) shall be treated as if such service were with Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries to the same extent that such service was recognized by
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time under the comparable Company Plan; _provided,_ that such crediting of
service does not result in any duplication of benefits. Purchaser shall in
accordance with applicable Law, and shall otherwise use its commercially
reasonable efforts to, ensure that each applicable Purchaser Plan that is a
group health plan shall waive eligibility waiting periods, evidence of
insurability requirements and pre-existing condition limitations to the extent
(i) similar limitations are already in effect with respect to a Continuing
Employee that have been satisfied or waived under the corresponding Company
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time or not included under the
corresponding Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
permitted by the applicable insurance policy or otherwise under the Purchaser
Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Purchaser in writing, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan
or arrangement, the Company shall (i) cause to be amended the employee
benefit plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the extent
necessary to provide that no employees of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall
commence participation therein following the Effective Time unless Purchaser
or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such participation and (ii) cause the
Company tax-qualified 401(k) plan to be terminated effective immediately prior
to the Effective Time. 

(b) Beginning at the Effective Time until December 31, 2012 (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide Continuing Employees with no less favorable salaries
or wages, and short-term bonus or commission opportunities (it being
understood that the components of commission opportunities may be modified to
reflect modifications of employees duties and responsibilities made by
Purchaser in its sole discretion) than as provided by the

 



84  Company and its Subsidiaries to such individual immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and with other compensation opportunities and benefits (except
equity based awards), that, taken as a whole, are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the compensation opportunities and benefits provided by the
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries to comparably situated employees of Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that, if the Continuing Employees continue
to receive the same compensation opportunities and benefits (except equity
based awards) that were provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such action would not breach
this Section 6.11(b).

(c) Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of
their respective Affiliates to, honor all Company Plans (including all
severance, change of control and similar plans and agreements) in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject
to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such Company
Plans; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or
termination of any specific plan, program policy, agreement or arrangement, or
interfere with Purchasers, the Surviving Corporations or any of their
respective Affiliates rights or obligations to make such changes as are
necessary to comply with applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser shall provide each Continuing Employee who suffers a termination
of employment during the Continuation Period under circumstances that would
have given the Continuing Employee a right to severance payments and benefits
under the Companys severance policy or individual employment, severance or
separation agreement or other arrangement in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time and as set forth on Section 6.11(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (each, a " _Company Severance Plan_ ") with severance payments
and benefits no less favorable than those that would have been provided to
such Continuing Employee under the applicable Company Severance Plan, as
calculated using the same salary or hourly wage rate or other compensation, as
applicable, provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except as Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, and such Continuing Employee may otherwise agree in writing.

 

(d) With respect to any accrued but unused vacation time to which any
Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation policy or individual
agreement or other arrangement applicable to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and as set forth on Section 6.11(d) of
the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Vacation Policy_ "), Purchaser shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) allow such Continuing
Employee to use such accrued vacation and (ii) if any Continuing Employees
employment terminates during the Continuation Period, pay the Continuing
Employee, in cash, an amount equal to the value of the accrued vacation time
to the same extent that the Continuing Employee would have received a cash
payment therefor under the Vacation Policy as in effect as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 



85 (e) The Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained herein with respect to Continuing Employees are included for the
sole benefit of the Purchaser and the Company and shall not create any right
(1) in any other person, including Company Plans or any beneficiary thereof,
or (2) to continued employment with the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries.
Nothing in this Section 6.11, whether express or implied, shall constitute an
amendment or other modification of any employee benefit plan, or limit the
right of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any employee benefit plan maintained by Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time.

(f) Prior to making any material broad-based communications in writing to the
directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide
Purchaser with a copy of the intended communication and Purchaser shall have a
reasonable period of time to review and comment on such communication. 

SECTION 6.12. _NYSE Listing and Delisting; Reservation for Issuance_.
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Purchaser Common
Shares to be issued in the Merger (the " _Listed Purchaser Common Shares_ ")
to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Purchaser and use reasonable best efforts to take, or

agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be

hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under

negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 8.04
without notice or liability to any other person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular

 



105   matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any

SECTION 9.10. _Assignment_ . Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any party hereto without the prior written
consent of the other party, and any purported assignment without such consent
shall be null and void.

SECTION 9.11. _Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction_ . (a) The
parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would
not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and any appellate
court of the State of Delaware) and the Federal courts of the United States
of America located in the State of Delaware (without proof of actual damages
and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with any such remedy), this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably consents and submits itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of
the United States of America located in the State of Delaware (collectively,
the _"Agreed Courts")_ solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement
of the provisions of this Agreement, and the documents referred to herein and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the _"Agreed
Issues")_. Each of parties hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a
defense in any action, suit or proceeding in an Agreed Court with respect to
the Agreed Issues that such party is not subject thereto or that such action,
suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such Agreed
Court or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement
or any such document may not be enforced in or by such Agreed Court, and the
parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to any action,
suit or proceeding with respect to the Agreed Issues shall be heard and
determined only in an Agreed Court. The parties hereby consent to and grant
to each Agreed Court jurisdiction over the person of such parties

 



106   and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter of any dispute
with respect to the Agreed Issues and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner
provided in Section 9.03 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, each party hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that it will not bring or support any action, suit or
proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Financing Commitment, the Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan of the City of New York, whether a state or federal court, and that
the provisions of Section 9.12 relating to the waiver of jury trial shall
apply to any such action, suit or proceeding. In no event shall Purchaser be
forced to litigate against its Financing Sources.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but without
limiting Section 9.11(a), the parties hereby further acknowledge and agree
that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Purchaser
to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 1.02, on the terms and
subject to the conditions in this Agreement if (a) all conditions in Section
7.01 and Section 7.02 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that,
by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing or the failure of which
to be satisfied is attributable, in whole or in part, to a breach by Purchaser
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement) and (b) the Financing has been funded or is available to be funded
at the Closing.

SECTION 9.12. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE

IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
