books and records of the Surviving Corporation and the applicable personnel of
Parent to the extent that they relate to the Closing Statements and to such  

  

 ![](agreementandplanofmerger040.jpg) 

SMRH:484497247.47 -35- SM01DOCS\\\1200417.35 historical financial information
(to the extent in Parent's possession or under its control) relating to the
Closing Statements as the Shareholder Representatives may reasonably request
for the purpose of reviewing such statements and to prepare any Statement of
Objections, provided, however, that such access shall be in a manner that does
not interfere with the normal business operations of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. (ii) Objection. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
the Shareholder Representatives may object to any of the Closing Statements
and the calculations of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness or Closing Transaction Expenses as set forth therein, as
applicable, by delivering to Parent a written statement setting forth its
objections in reasonable detail, indicating specifically each disputed item
and the amount thereof and the basis for its disagreement therewith (the
"Statement of Objections"). If the Shareholder Representatives do not deliver
a Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period with
respect to any of the calculations, then the Closing Statements and the
calculations of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness and Closing Transaction Expenses as set forth therein shall be
deemed to have been accepted by the Shareholder Representatives and shall be
final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. Any calculation or
matter that is not disputed in any Statement of Objections prior to the
expiration of the Review Period shall also be final, binding and conclusive
for all purposes hereunder. After the expiration of the Review Period, the
Shareholder Representatives may not introduce additional objections with
respect to any matter or calculation set forth in the Closing Statements or
increase the amount of any dispute. If the Shareholder Representatives
delivers a Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period,
Parent and the Shareholder Representatives shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve the objections made therein within thirty (30) days after the delivery
of the Statement of Objections (the "Resolution Period"). If the same are so
resolved in a signed agreement within the Resolution Period, then such
resolution shall be final and binding. (iii) Resolution of Disputes. If the
Shareholder Representatives and Parent fail to reach an agreement with respect
to all of the matters set forth in any Statement of Objections before
expiration of the Resolution Period, then any amounts remaining in dispute
("Disputed Amounts") shall be submitted for final and binding resolution to
the Independent Accountant, who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall
resolve the Disputed Amounts and make any adjustments as may be required. All
adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality. Each party shall be
permitted to present a supporting brief to the Independent Accountant (which
supporting brief shall also be concurrently provided to the other party)
within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the Independent Accountant,
provided that neither Party may introduce additional objections or positions
not reflected in the Closing Statements (in the case of Parent) or in the
Statement of Objections (in the case of the Shareholder Representatives).
Within fifteen (15) days of receipt of a supporting brief, the receiving party
may present a responsive brief to the Independent Accountant (which responsive
brief shall also be concurrently provided to the other party). No discovery
will be permitted and no hearing will be held. The Independent Accountant
shall only consider the briefs of the parties, and shall not conduct any
independent review, in determining those items and amounts disputed by the
parties, and the  

  

 ![](agreementandplanofmerger041.jpg) 

SMRH:484497247.47 -36- SM01DOCS\\\1200417.35 Independent Accountant shall
consider only those items and amounts which are identified by the parties as
being in dispute and were included in the Statement of Objections. The
Independent Accountant shall only decide the Disputed Amounts and its decision
for each such Disputed Amount must be either the position of the Parent or the
Shareholder Representatives (i.e., the Independent Accountant may not impose
an alternative resolution with respect to any Disputed Amount). (iv)
Determination by Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall
deliver to Parent and the Shareholder Representatives, as promptly as
practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days (or such other time as
Parent and the Shareholder Representatives may agree in writing) after receipt
of the last responsive brief that was timely submitted, a written report
setting forth the resolution of the Disputed Amounts determined in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. Subject to manifest mathematical error, the
determination of the Independent Accountant (and any related adjustments to
the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness or Closing
Transaction Expenses) shall be final, binding and non-appealable and non-
reviewable (including disputing any matter concerning the Closing Statements
or the Disputed Amounts through California Courts). (v) Fees of the
Independent Accountant. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant
shall be paid and allocated between the Shareholder Representatives (on behalf
of the holders of Company Capital Stock and Exchanged Options), on the one
hand, and Parent, on the other hand in proportion to the extent such Parties
do not prevail in the aggregate on Disputed Amounts (e.g., if there are
$200,000 of Disputed Amounts and the Independent Accountant determines that
the Shareholder Representatives prevail with respect to $125,000 and Parent
prevails with respect to $75,000, then 62.5% of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be paid by Parent, and 37.5% of the fees and
expense will be paid by the Shareholder Representatives (on behalf of the
holders of Company Capital Stock and Exchanged Options). Any such fees and
expenses payable by the Shareholder Representatives shall be paid from the
Shareholder Representative Expense Amount to the extent available, and
otherwise by the Former Holders of Company Capital Stock or Exchanged Options.
(d) Payment of Post-Closing Adjustment. (i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is
a negative number, then Parent shall be entitled to payment of an amount equal
to the absolute value thereof, which payment shall be satisfied: first, from
the Adjustment Escrow Amount (and the Shareholder Representatives and Parent
shall instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse such amount, up to the entire
Adjustment Escrow Amount, to Parent); second, from the Indemnification Escrow
Amount (and the Shareholder Representatives and Parent shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to disburse such amount, up to the entire Indemnification Escrow
Amount, to Parent); and third, from each Former Holder of Company Capital
Stock and Exchanged Options, who shall, within ten (10) Business Days after
the Determination Date, pay to Parent his, her or its Pro Rata Share of the
remaining unpaid absolute value of such Post-Closing Adjustment.

SMRH:484497247.47 -37- SM01DOCS\\\1200417.35 (ii) If the Post-Closing
Adjustment is a positive number, then Parent shall, within ten (10) Business
Days after the Determination Date, deposit the Post-Closing Adjustment with
the Paying Agent, who will (A) distribute to the Former Holders of Company
Capital Stock in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, the amount
of each such holder's Pro Rata Share of the Post-Closing Adjustment, and (B)
deposit with the Surviving Corporation or its designee payroll service
provider, for payment to Former Holders of Exchanged Options (subject to
Section 2.18) in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, the amount
of each such Former Holder's Pro Rata Share of the Post- Closing Adjustment.
(iii) Any amounts required to be paid under this Section 2.20(d), shall be
accompanied by interest on such amounts from the tenth Business Day following
the Determination Date through the date paid at the rate of eight percent (8%)
per annum, compounded annually, calculated on the basis of a year of 365 or
366 days (as applicable) and the number of days elapsed since the
Determination Date. (iv) Within five (5) Business Days after the Determination
Date, Parent and the Shareholder Representatives shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release the remaining portion, if any, of
the Adjustment Escrow Amount that has not been disbursed and is not required
to be disbursed to Parent pursuant to Section 2.20(d)(i) (A) to the Paying
Agent, for distribution to the Former Holders of Company Capital Stock in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, the aggregate of each such
holder's Pro Rata Share of any amounts remaining in the Adjustment Escrow
Fund, and (B) to the Surviving Corporation, for distribution to Former Holders
of Exchanged Options (subject to Section 2.18), the aggregate of each such
holder's respective Pro Rata Share of any amounts remaining in the Adjustment
Escrow Fund. (e) Adjustments for Tax Purposes. Any payments made pursuant to
this Section 2.20 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by
the Parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law. 2.21
Consideration Spreadsheet. (a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing, and thereafter promptly (and in any case within one (1) Business Day)
after the occurrence of any event, such as the exercise of an Option, which
renders the information previously provided no longer true and correct, the

Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, nor any of their respective

provision of any Law or Order, or materially encroach on any property owned by
others. (d) No notice of default or termination with respect to the Leased
Real Property is outstanding or threatened in writing. Neither the Company nor

the Company's Representations and Warranties. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is
relying on the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this
Agreement and in the Ancillary Documents to which the Company is a party and
on its own investigation and analysis in entering into the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is knowledgeable about the
industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate and is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of the Merger as contemplated by this
Agreement and is able to bear the substantial economic risk of such investment
for an indefinite period of time. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has been
afforded access to the books and records, facilities and personnel of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of conducting a due diligence
investigation and has conducted a full due diligence investigation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company has provided Parent the opportunity
to ask questions of the officers of the Company and of its Subsidiaries,
including without limitation regarding the business and financial condition of
the Company and of its Subsidiaries, and has answered to the satisfaction of
Parent all questions asked by Parent or its representatives, advisors and
agents regarding documents, data and information posted in the electronic data
room maintained by the Company and its financial advisors for purposes of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters as is required for evaluating the merits and
risks of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and is capable of
such evaluation. Except for the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document to which the Company is
a party, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied upon any representation or
warranty, whether express or implied, with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, affairs, assets, liabilities,
financial condition, results of operations, future operating or financial
results, estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans or prospects) or with respect to the accuracy or completeness
of any other information provided or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives, lenders, Affiliates or any other Person acting on its behalf
by or on behalf of the Company or its officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives, lenders or Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, nothing herein shall impair the ability of Parent to seek
recovery for fraud. 4.11 Governmental Approvals. Except as may relate to
approvals required under applicable Antitrust Laws, to the Knowledge of
Parent, there is no material fact relating to Parent's, Merger Sub's or any of
their Subsidiaries' respective businesses, operations, financial condition or
legal status, including any officer's, director's or current employee's
status, that would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the Parties
to obtain, on a timely basis, any authorization, consent, Order, declaration
or approval of, or ability to contract with, any Governmental Entity necessary
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 4.12
Information Statement. None of the information provided by Parent or Merger
Sub for inclusion in the Information Statement will contain an untrue
statement of material fact or will omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of such individual's serving in
such capacity that existed or occurred on or prior to the Closing Date
(including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby); provided, however, that Parent shall not be obligated to

such consolidating or merging Person shall succeed to and assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.8. (d) The rights and obligations
under this Section 5.8 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as

any and all rights to which such Company Indemnitee may otherwise be entitled
by contract or as a matter of Law or equity, and extends to such Company
Indemnitee's successors, assigns and legal representatives; provided, however,
that (i) to the extent that any Company Indemnitee is entitled to be
indemnified by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (and any

may be entitled by contract or as a matter of Law or equity (a "Secondary
Indemnitor") or by any insurer under any other policy applicable to such
Company Indemnitee (a "Secondary Insurer"), the obligations of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (and any of their respective
successors or assigns) or any insurer under Section 5.8 shall be primary and
the obligations of any such Secondary Indemnitor or Secondary Insurer shall be

provided herein and subject to the exceptions provided in the immediately
preceding sentence, each Seller Releasing Party agrees that such Seller
Releasing Party shall not make any Claims for indemnification against any of
the Seller Released Parties by reason of the fact that such Seller Releasing
Party was an equityholder, director, officer, employee or agent, directly or
indirectly, of any of the Seller Released Parties or was serving at the
request of any of the Seller Released Parties as a partner, trustee, director,
officer, employee or agent of another Entity (whether such claim is for
judgments, damages, penalties, fines, costs, amounts paid in settlement,
losses, expenses or otherwise) with respect to any claim for indemnification
brought against such Seller Releasing Party or any claim against such Seller
Releasing Party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and such Seller Releasing Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that
such Seller Releasing Party shall have no claims or right to contribution or
indemnity from any of the Seller Released Parties with respect to any amounts
paid by such Seller Releasing Party or from the Adjustment Escrow Fund
pursuant to Section 2.20(d) or the Indemnification Escrow pursuant to Article
X or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Seller Releasing Parties recognize that they may have released
claims of which they are totally unaware and unsuspecting, but that which they
are nevertheless releasing and giving up by providing the general release set
forth above and to the extent, if any, set forth in such Seller Releasing
Parties' respective Letters of Transmittal or Option Termination Agreements or
in the Support Agreement. This Section 5.10 is not intended to be a waiver of
any right to indemnification of any director, officer or employee of any of
the Released Parties who remains such after the Closing or pursuant to Section

SMRH:484497247.47 -79- SM01DOCS\\\1200417.35 (b) Effective upon the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation, for itself and on behalf of each of its former and
present Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Buyer Releasing Parties" and,
together with the Seller Releasing Parties, the "Releasing Parties"), hereby
releases and forever discharges each Person who is now, or who will have been
at any time since the Reference Date, an officer, director, member, manager or
equity or interest holder of the Company or any of its present or former
Subsidiaries (or a fiduciary of any Benefit Plan) and each Person directly or
indirectly controlling any of the foregoing Persons (collectively, the "Buyer
Released Parties" and, together with the Seller Released Parties, the
"Released Parties") from any and all Claims, which any of the Buyer Releasing
Parties had or now has, at law or in equity, against any of the Buyer Released
Parties in any way arising out of, in connection with, pertaining to or by
reason of (i) their respective status as an officer, director, member,
manager, or equity or interest holder of the Company or of any of its present
or former Subsidiaries (or as a fiduciary of any Benefit Plan) or as a Person
controlling any of the foregoing Persons, or (ii) any acts or omissions, or
alleged acts or omissions, by any of them in their respective capacities as
such, which acts or omissions existed or occurred at or prior to the Closing,
in each case except for any claims, rights, obligations, debts, liabilities,
actions or causes of action that arise as a result of intentional or reckless
misconduct, fraud, or criminal act by the Released Party. Subject to the
following sentence, each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledges the
release by the Company and its Subsidiaries set forth in the preceding
sentence and covenants and agrees that it will honor such release and will
not, and will cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, not
to, take any action inconsistent therewith (including commencing any Action
with respect to, or directly or indirectly transferring to another Person, any
claim so released). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no
release is being given herein with respect to any Claims arising under or in
connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary Document (including any
covenant, agreement, representation, warranty or otherwise). (c) Each
Releasing Party acknowledges that the Laws of many states provide
substantially the following: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH
THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME
OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY
AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR, and further acknowledges that
such provisions are designed to protect a party from waiving claims which such
party does not know exist or may exist. Nonetheless, each Releasing Party
agrees that, effective as of the Effective Time, such Releasing Party shall be
deemed to waive any such provision, and further agrees that such Releasing
Party shall not (i) institute any Action based upon, arising out of or
relating to any of the released claims, (ii) participate, assist or cooperate
in any such Action or (iii) encourage, assist or solicit any third party to
institute any such Action. Each Releasing Party represents and warrants to
each of its Released Parties that it has not assigned any claim contemplated
to be released hereunder. 5.11 Distributions. Subject to Section 2.20(b), the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall have the complete and unrestricted right,
at any time at or prior to the Closing, to distribute all or any  

  

 ![](agreementandplanofmerger085.jpg) 

SMRH:484497247.47 -80- SM01DOCS\\\1200417.35 portion of the cash held by the
Company or any such Subsidiary to the holders of Company Capital Stock (or to
the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable); provided, that such distribution
is in accordance with Law and the applicable organizational documents. 5.12
Distributions from the Adjustment Escrow Fund and the Indemnification Escrow
Fund. Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, distributions of the
Adjustment Escrow Fund and the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be made
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Escrow Agreement and otherwise
disbursed (i) from the Adjustment Escrow Fund upon the joint instructions of
the Shareholder Representatives and Parent in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2.20 and (ii) from the Indemnification Escrow Fund upon the joint
instructions of the Shareholder Representatives and Parent in accordance with
the provisions of Section 10.8. 5.13 Parent RWI Policy. (a) Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Parent RWI Policy to be bound and
issued and, thereafter, to remain in full force and effect, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) satisfy all subjectives or other
conditions to issuance associated with the Parent RWI Policy, including those
conditions as set forth in the Binder Agreement, (ii) pay when due all
premiums, fees, costs, taxes and commissions associated therewith, and (iii)
comply in all material respects with the terms and conditions of the Parent
RWI Policy and Binder Agreement. (b) The total premium and any surplus lines,
underwriting fees and broker compensation charged by the insurer for the
Parent RWI Policy shall be borne 100% by Parent. (c) The Parent RWI Policy
shall (i) name Parent as the insured; (ii) insure Parent and any Parent
Indemnified Party for any breach of the representations and warranties of the
Company in this Agreement; and (iii) contain a waiver of subrogation by the
insurer in favor of the Shareholder Indemnified Parties except in cases of
actual fraud. (d) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company (prior to the Effective Time) or the Shareholder Representatives
(after the Effective Time) (which consent shall, in either case, not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), amend, modify, terminate or
waive any provision of the Parent RWI Policy if the result of such amendment,
modification, termination or waiver would reasonably be expected to have an
adverse impact on any Shareholder Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof
(in light of the purpose of the Parent RWI Policy as reflected in Article X),
including any changes to the insurer's rights to subrogation or any change in,
or with respect to, the retention amount under the Parent RWI Policy. 5.14
Intentionally omitted. 5.15 Termination of Certain Contracts. Prior to or at
Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) terminate
all Contracts and Benefit Plans that are set forth on Schedule 5.15 and (ii)
terminate any service provider with respect to whom the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred Transaction Expenses and satisfy all liabilities
relating to such service providers except to the extent set forth in the
Closing Statement of Transaction Expenses.

SMRH:484497247.47 -81- SM01DOCS\\\1200417.35 5.16 Updated Schedule. At any
time no less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company will provide Parent with a copy of any amendments or supplements that
the Company proposes to make to the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered or
to be delivered by the Company hereunder based on events or circumstances
occurring after the Agreement Date (the "Updated Schedule"). For the avoidance
of doubt, no updates are permitted for matters occurring on or prior to the
Agreement Date. An Updated Schedule shall not cure any breach or inaccuracy of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement for any purposes
under this Agreement (including for purposes of Section 8.2, Article IX or
Article X) or prejudice any rights of Parent under this Agreement, including
the right to claim that the representations and warranties of the Company,
when made on the Agreement Date, were untrue, or that any condition to Closing
was unfulfilled. 5.17 Financial Reporting Cooperation; Post-Signing Interim
Financial Statements; 2017 Audited Financial Statements. (a) Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to
provide, such reasonable and customary assistance as Parent may from time to
time reasonably request in connection with Parent's preparation for its post-
Closing reporting obligations under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to provide any such
assistance that would interfere with the normal business operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or that would require the Company or its
Subsidiaries to incur any third party fees and expenses. (b) Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall furnish to Parent the unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries at September 30, 2017, the
unaudited consolidated income statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the nine (9) month period ended on such balance sheet date and the
comparable period from the prior fiscal year, the unaudited consolidated
statement of shareholders' equity of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
such balance sheet date and the unaudited consolidated statement of cash flows
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the nine (9) month period ended on
such balance sheet date and the comparable period from the prior fiscal year,
in each case as prepared in accordance with GAAP on a consistent basis,
subject to the absence of footnotes and normal year-end adjustments, and all
as reviewed by the Company Auditor (collectively, the "Post-Signing Interim
Financial Statements"). (c) After January 15, 2018, if the Closing has not yet
occurred and this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to Article IX
hereof, then upon Parent's written request, the Company shall engage the
Auditor to undertake the audit and related procedures necessary for the
Auditor to deliver to the Company the 2017 Audited Financial Statements. The
Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and the auditor to furnish to
Parent the 2017 Audited Financial Statements no later than on April 30, 2018;
provided, however, that if the Closing occurs prior to any delivery of the
2017 Audited Financial Statements, the Company's obligations under this
Section 5.17(c) shall terminate upon the Closing. (d) Parent shall pay, or
shall reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for, all fees and expenses
payable to the Company Auditor in connection with the preparation and review
of the Post-Signing Interim Financial Statements and, if the 2017 Audited
Financial Statements are  

  

 ![](agreementandplanofmerger087.jpg) 

SMRH:484497247.47 -82- SM01DOCS\\\1200417.35 required to be provided to Parent
hereunder, the preparation and audit of the 2017 Audited Financial Statements.
Parent shall pay or reimburse such amounts promptly, and in any event within
the five (5) Business Days, following the Company's delivery to Parent from
time to time of any invoice or invoices evidencing such fees and expenses.
5.18 Post-Signing Company Filing. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall make
the filing described on Section 5.18 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and,
at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such filing, shall
provide a copy thereof to Parent for review and comment. The Company shall in
good faith consider any comments provided by Parent for inclusion into such
filing. From and after the Closing, Parent shall address such filing and the
matters covered thereby in accordance with the requirements set forth on
Section 5.18 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. ARTICLE VI EMPLOYEE MATTERS
6.1 Treatment of Employees. For all purposes (including for purposes of
vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee
benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any
Business Employee after the Closing (the "New Plans"), each Business Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Closing, to the same
extent as such Business Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit
for such service under any similar Benefit Plan in which such Business
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Closing; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply (i) to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits to the
Business Employee for the same period of service, (ii) for benefit accrual
purposes under any New Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan, and (iii)
to any newly established Benefit Plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries for which
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries do not receive past
service credit. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each Business Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Benefit Plan in which such
Business Employee participated immediately before the Closing (such plans,
collectively, the "Old Plans"), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Business
Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Business
Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not
have been waived under the Old Plans. With regards to continuing Business
Employees, Parent or one of its Affiliates (including the Company and
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time), the PEO Arrangement will continue
through the Closing, and, as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing, Parent shall take all necessary actions to transition the Business
Employees onto the New Plans following any requisite notice and termination
provisions under the PEO Arrangement. 6.2 Termination of 401(k) Plan. The
Company shall cause Themis to take all necessary actions to terminate the
Themis 401(k) Plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan") effective as of the day
immediately prior to the Closing. As soon as practicable following the
Closing, Parent shall take all necessary actions to permit the Business
Employees that are entitled to receive an "eligible rollover distribution" (as
defined in Code Section 402(c)(4)) from the Company 401(k) Plan, to roll over  

  

 ![](agreementandplanofmerger088.jpg) 

SMRH:484497247.47 -83- SM01DOCS\\\1200417.35 eligible rollover distribution as
part of any lump sum distribution into an account under a defined contribution
401(k) savings plan maintained by Parent or one of its Affiliates, subject to
and in accordance with the provisions of such plan and applicable Law. 6.3 No
Third-Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Article VI are solely for
the benefit of the Parties and are not intended to confer upon any other
Persons any rights or remedies hereunder. Nothing in this Agreement shall
preclude Parent or any of its Affiliates, at any time, from (i) amending,
merging, modifying, terminating, eliminating, reducing or otherwise altering
in any respect any Benefit Plan, any benefit under any Benefit Plan or any
trust, insurance policy or funding vehicle related to any Benefit Plan, or
(ii) terminating, demoting or taking other actions with respect to any
Business Employee after the Effective Time. ARTICLE VII TAX MATTERS 7.1 Tax
Returns. (a) Filing of Tax Returns. Parent shall prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries for any Pre- Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period
required to be filed after the Closing Date (such Tax Returns referred to
herein as the "Parent-Prepared Tax Returns"). All Parent-Prepared Tax Returns
relating solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be prepared at the sole
expense of the Former Holders of Company Capital Stock and Exchanged Options.
All Parent-Prepared Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
the past practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law. All Tax Benefits shall be reported on applicable
Income Tax Returns solely as Income Tax deductions of the Company and/or the
Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period or allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and shall not be treated or
reported as Income Tax deductions for any period beginning after the Closing
Date, including under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or
any comparable or similar provision under state or local Law) to the extent
allowable by Law. If and to the extent that Former Holders of Company Capital
Stock and Exchanged Options have any liability pursuant to Section 7.1(b) for
the Taxes shown as due on any Parent-Prepared Tax Return (with copies of any
relevant schedules, work papers and other documentation then available),
Parent shall submit such Parent-Prepared Tax Return to the Shareholder
Representatives for comment and review (i) not less than twenty-five (25)
Business Days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return in the
case of a Parent-Prepared Tax Return that is an Income Tax Return, and (ii)
not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date for the filing of
such Tax Return in the case of a Parent-Prepared Tax Return that is not an
Income Tax Return. Parent shall make (or cause to be made) any changes to such
Parent-Prepared Tax Returns reasonably requested in writing by the Shareholder
Representatives no later than (x) ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on
which such Parent- Prepared Tax Return that is an Income Tax Return is
required to be filed, and (y) five (5) Business Days prior to the date on
which such Parent-Prepared Tax Return that is an Income Tax Return is required
to be filed. The Former Holders of Company Capital Stock and Exchanged Options
shall promptly pay to Parent all Pre-Closing Taxes reflected on all filed
Parent-Prepared Tax Returns, except to the extent and in such amount as such
Pre-Closing Taxes were taken into account as  

  

 ![](agreementandplanofmerger089.jpg) 

SMRH:484497247.47 -84- SM01DOCS\\\1200417.35 liabilities in computing the
Closing Net Working Capital or paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior
to Closing. (b) Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement (including Article X), the Former Holders of Company Capital
Stock and Exchanged Options shall indemnify and hold harmless the Parent
Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Taxes) sustained or incurred by the Parent Indemnified
Parties arising or resulting from or attributable to: (i) Pre-Closing Taxes,
and (ii) any breach or violation of, or failure to fully perform, any
covenant, agreement or obligation of the Shareholder Representatives or the
Former Holders of Company Capital Stock and Exchanged Options in this Article
VII; provided, however, that the Parent Indemnified Parties shall only be
entitled to indemnification under (i) and (ii) above to the extent such Taxes
were (A) not the result of a Buyer Tax Act or (B) not taken into account as
liabilities in computing the Closing Net Working Capital. Other than the
Parent RWI Policy, and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10.2,
the indemnification provisions of this Section 7.1(b) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to any claim
related to or arising from the obligations of this Article VII. (c) Tax
Benefits. Parent shall pay to the Former Holders of Company Capital Stock and
Exchanged Options, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 7.2,
an amount in cash equal to the Realized Tax Benefits promptly following the
filing of any Tax Return on which a Realized Tax Benefit is reflected. In
preparing Tax Returns for any taxable period that ends after the Closing Date,
Parent shall and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries) to use their commercially reasonable efforts
to pursue the largest amount of Realized Tax Benefit in the earliest taxable
period allowed by applicable Law. In the event any Tax Benefits taken into
account for purposes of determining Realized Tax Benefits are subsequently
disallowed or determined to be an amount less than the amount taken into
account to make a payment pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) by a Tax Authority,
the Former Holders of Company Capital Stock and Exchanged Options shall
promptly return such excess to Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates,
along with any applicable interest and penalties. 7.2 Amended Returns;
Refunds. Parent shall not amend, nor shall it cause or permit the Company to
amend, any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written
consent of the Shareholder Representatives, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed; provided, however, that at the request of the
Shareholder Representatives, Parent shall file or cause to be filed at the
sole expense of the Former Holders of Company Capital Stock and Exchanged
Options, an amended Tax Return or claim for Tax refund with respect to Taxes
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
for any Straddle Period; provided, further, that Parent shall have no
obligation to file any amended Tax Return or claim for Tax refund that would,
as reasonably determined in good faith by Parent, increase the Tax liability
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, or any of their
Affiliates with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date, or for which Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, or any of their Affiliates would otherwise be responsible. To
the extent not arising from the carryback for a loss arising after the Closing
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date, any refunds of Taxes that are received by Parent, or, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, that relate to  

  

 ![](agreementandplanofmerger090.jpg) 

SMRH:484497247.47 -85- SM01DOCS\\\1200417.35 which the Former Holders of
Company Capital Stock and Exchanged Options would be responsible pursuant to
Section 7.1(b) shall be for the account of such Former Holders and Parent
shall (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) promptly pay over after
receipt the following amounts (in each case, less any Taxes imposed on the
receipt thereof, and less all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, or any of their
Affiliates in obtaining such amounts): (i) to the Paying Agent, for
distribution to the holders of Company Capital Stock in accordance with their
Pro Rata Shares, the aggregate of each such holder's Pro Rata Share of such
refund, and (ii) to the Surviving Corporation, for distribution to Former
Holders of Exchanged Options, the aggregate of each such holder's Pro Rata
Share of such refund. In the event any Tax refund is subsequently disallowed
or determined to be an amount less than the amount taken into account to make
a payment pursuant to this Section 7.2 by a Tax Authority, the Former Holders
of Company Capital Stock and Exchanged Options shall promptly return such
excess to Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates, along with any
applicable interest and penalties. 7.3 Transfer Taxes. All stamp, transfer,
documentary, sales and use, value added, registration and other such Taxes and
fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this
Agreement or any other transaction contemplated hereby (collectively, the
"Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by Parent after the Closing Date, and Parent,
at its own expense, shall procure any stock transfer stamps required by, and
properly file on a timely basis, all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to, any of the Transfer Taxes. Each of the Parties
will cooperate with each other to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Tax Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any such Transfer Taxes. 7.4 Cooperation. The Shareholder
Representatives and Parent agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including
reasonable access to books and records, Tax Returns and Tax filings) and
assistance as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Return, the
conduct of any Tax audit, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
proceeding relating to any Tax matter. The Shareholder Representatives and
Parent shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Tax audit or
other Tax Proceedings and each shall execute and deliver such powers of
attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this
Section 7.4. Any Tax audit or other Tax Proceeding shall be deemed to be a
Third Party Claim subject to the procedures set forth in Section 10.5 of this
Agreement. ARTICLE VIII CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS TO CLOSE 8.1 Conditions to

Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of their representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement, or any such representations or
warranties fail to be true and correct, or Parent or Merger Sub shall have
breached or failed to perform any of their covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, and such breaches or failures (i) would give rise
to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.3(a) or 8.3(b) and (ii)

to the date that is thirty (30) days from the date that the Company notifies

fraud, or (iii) any breach of this Agreement arising prior to termination of

contained in Sections 3.1 (Organization and Qualification; Authority), 3.2
(Company Capital Stock), 3.3 (Subsidiaries), 3.4 (Authority Relative to this

Representations") shall survive the Closing Date for the applicable statute of
limitations, (ii) the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.16

which time they shall terminate and be of no further force and effect. Each
covenant and agreement set forth in Section 2.14, and each covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement requiring performance at or after the
Closing, shall expressly survive Closing for the applicable statute of
limitations, except as otherwise provided herein (with it being understood
that Parent shall also be liable for breach of any covenant or agreement
requiring performance by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
after the Closing and that nothing herein shall limit or affect Parent's or
Merger Sub's or any of their respective Affiliates' liability for the failure
to pay the Merger Consideration or pay other amounts as required hereunder).
The period from the Closing Date until the date upon which any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or in any Ancillary Document

entitled to make any claim in respect of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement after the expiration of its applicable Survival Period,
except that, to the extent that an Indemnitee provides written notice to the
applicable indemnifying Person of a claim prior to the expiration of the
applicable Survival Period for such claim, then such claim shall survive until
it is finally settled or resolved pursuant to this Agreement. 10.2

conditions and limitations provided herein, from and after the Closing, the

Company Capital Stock, or any Claims contesting the termination prior to or at
the Closing of any Option or shareholder right existing prior to the Closing,

Share; (v) any Closing Transaction Expenses not otherwise paid pursuant to
this Agreement or included in the calculation of the Closing Merger
Consideration; (vi) any Closing Indebtedness not otherwise paid pursuant to

therein unless and until the aggregate amount of such Losses suffered by
Parent Indemnified Parties exceeds, on a cumulative basis since the Closing
Date, an amount equal to $900,000 (the "Deductible"), at which time Parent
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover only such Losses which exceed
the Deductible; (ii) the aggregate Losses recoverable by Parent Indemnified
Parties in excess of the Deductible under Section 10.2(a) shall not exceed the
Indemnification Escrow Fund; (iii) the aggregate Losses recoverable by Parent

Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover only such Losses which exceed
such amount; and (vii) the indemnity obligation of the Former Holders is
several and not joint, based on each Former Holder's Pro Rata Share and only
with respect to their pro rata amount of any Losses; provided, however that up
to the amount of the Indemnification Escrow Fund, liability among the Former
Holders will be joint and several; provided, however, that the limitations set
forth in Sections 10.2(b)(i) and (ii) shall not apply to any claim of fraud or
breach or inaccuracy of any Company Fundamental Representation, and Losses
arising out of or as a result of any claim of fraud or breach or inaccuracy of
any Company Fundamental Representation shall not be applied against the
Deductible. (c) Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations provided
herein, from and after the Closing, each Former Holder of Company Capital
Stock or Exchanged Options shall indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties for
Losses incurred by Parent Indemnified Parties relating to, in connection with
or as a result of: (i) any breach by such Former Holder of, or any failure by
such Former Holder to perform or comply with, any covenant or other obligation
included in this Agreement; (ii) any fraud in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby committed by or on behalf such Former

of Merger Consideration actually paid to such Former Holder under this
Agreement (including (A) the Former Holder's Pro Rata Share of amounts, if
any, disbursed to the Former Holder from the Adjustment Escrow Fund and/or the
Indemnification Escrow Fund and (B) by way of offset of any Shareholder
Obligations or Exchanged Options Exercise Price taken into account with
respect to such Former Holder, but excluding any portion of the Shareholder
Representative Fund). 10.3 Indemnification of Shareholder Indemnified Parties.
Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations provided herein, from and
after the Closing, Parent shall indemnify the Former Holders of Company
Capital Stock and Exchanged Options and, to the extent applicable, their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors
and permitted assigns, (collectively, the "Shareholder Indemnified Parties")
for any Losses incurred by Shareholder Indemnified Parties arising out of or
as a result of: (a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
made by Parent and Merger Sub in Article IV; (b) any breach of any covenant or
agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub herein, or any breach of any covenant
or agreement made by the Company (or the Surviving Corporation) herein.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) Shareholder Indemnified

that the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses suffered by Shareholder
Indemnified Parties on a cumulative basis since the Closing Date exceeds an

the immediately foregoing clause (A), or against the determination of whether
the aggregate amount of Losses has exceeded an amount equal to the
Indemnification Escrow Amount. 10.4 Mitigation; Other Limitations on
Liability. (a) Each party entitled to indemnification hereunder shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all indemnifiable Losses
(including, without limitation, by seeking recovery under any policy of
insurance applicable thereto) after having actual knowledge that an event has
given rise to Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder. For the avoidance of
doubt, any out- of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such mitigation
efforts shall be included as indemnifiable Losses recoverable hereunder; and
provided, further, that such duty to mitigate shall be deemed not to include
any obligations to commence or threaten to commence any Action against any
customer, Governmental Entity, supplier or other Person with whom any Parent
Indemnified Party or Shareholder Indemnified Party has any, direct or
indirect, material ongoing business  

  

 ![](agreementandplanofmerger099.jpg) 

SMRH:484497247.47 -94- SM01DOCS\\\1200417.35 relationship (other than with
respect to such Action as may be necessary to effect notice and to protect the
prospective Indemnitee's rights under any applicable policy of insurance;
provided, however, that such prospective Indemnitee shall not be obligated to
initiate litigation or arbitration against any insurer hereunder). (b) Neither
Parent Indemnified Parties nor Shareholder Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to indemnification for any Loss to the extent that the Loss arose
from or was exacerbated by any action taken directly or indirectly by any
Parent Indemnified Party or Shareholder Indemnified Party, respectively. (c)
No Party shall have any liability for any Loss which would not have arisen but
for any alteration or repeal or enactment of any Law after the Closing Date.
10.5 Defense of Third Party Claims. (a) If a third party notifies any Parent
Indemnified Party or Shareholder Indemnified Party (an "Indemnitee") of any
matter (a "Third Party Claim") which may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against such Person under this Article X, then the Indemnitee
shall notify the Shareholder Representatives (in the case of Parent
Indemnified Parties seeking indemnification) or Parent (in the case of
Shareholder Indemnified Parties seeking indemnification) (each, for purposes
of this Article X, an "Indemnity Administrator") of the Third Party Claim in
writing promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days, after receiving
written notice of such Third Party Claim, describing the claim in detail, the
amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof; provided,
that the failure to so notify the Indemnity Administrator shall not limit the
indemnification obligations under this Agreement except to the extent that the
defense of such Third Party Claim is actually prejudiced by the failure to
give such notice. (b) Unless such Third Party Claim is being controlled by the
carrier under the Parent RWI Policy, subject to the terms set forth in this
Section 10.5(b), the applicable Indemnity Administrator shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim at such Indemnity
Administrator's expense and, at its option and so long as the Indemnity
Administrator notifies the Indemnitee in writing that the indemnifying Party
has agreed to indemnify the Indemnitee (subject to the Deductible, if
applicable, and any other limitations) for any and all Losses arising out of
or resulting from such Third Party Claim, the Indemnity Administrator shall be
entitled to assume, and thereafter conduct, the defense of such Third Party
Claim with counsel of its choice that is reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnitee; provided, that such Indemnity Administrator shall not be entitled
to assume or control the defense of any Third Party Claim if (i) the Third
Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any matter involving
possible criminal conduct, (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against any Indemnitee, (iii) the Third Party Claim has or
would reasonably be expected to result in Losses in excess of the amounts then
available pursuant to the indemnification limitations set forth in Section
10.2 or 10.3, as applicable, provided that amounts available from Former
Holders shall not be deemed available for purposes of Section 10.2, or (iv)
the Indemnity Administrator has failed or is failing to defend in good faith
the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnity Administrator assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose at
its own expense. If the Indemnity Administrator assumes the defense of  

  

 ![](agreementandplanofmerger100.jpg) 

SMRH:484497247.47 -95- SM01DOCS\\\1200417.35 any Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnity Administrator in such
defense and make available to the Indemnity Administrator, at the Indemnitee's
expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnitee's possession or under the Indemnitee's control relating thereto as
is reasonably required in good faith by the Indemnity Administrator. No
Indemnity Administrator shall, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), consent
to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or compromise or
otherwise acknowledge or admit the validity of any claim or liability if such
entry of judgment, settlement, compromise, acknowledgement or admission (i)
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant
or plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a release from all liability in respect of
such claim, (ii) would result in the imposition of any injunction or other
equitable remedy against the Indemnitee, (iii) would be deemed an admission of
any material violation of Law by the Indemnitee or (iv) if the Shareholder
Representatives are the Indemnity Administrator, would not be paid in full
from the Indemnification Escrow Fund, from Parent's insurance, including under
the Parent RWI Policy, or by the Former Holders. (c) If the Indemnity
Administrator does not assume control of the defense of such claim within
thirty (30) days following the Indemnity Administrator's receipt of notice of
such claim in accordance with the foregoing provisions, then the Indemnitee
shall have the right to defend such claim in such manner as it may deem
appropriate at the Indemnitee's own cost and expense, but subject to any
rights to indemnification hereunder. Any and all reasonable costs and expenses
of Indemnitee incurred in defending such claim shall be subject to
indemnification by the indemnifying Party hereunder, it being understood that
the Indemnity Administrator is not waiving any right to contest such costs and
expenses or the obligation to indemnify with respect to any such claim. (d)
Each of the Indemnitee and Indemnity Administrator will, at their own expense,
reasonably cooperate and assist the other and their counsel in the review,
investigation and defense of any such claim, shall make reasonably available
its personnel, and shall reasonably provide such testimony and access to their
books and records in connection therewith during normal business hours and in
a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt the normal business operations of
such Person. 10.6 Direct Losses. If, after the Closing, an Indemnitee incurs a
Loss for which the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, other than as a
result of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnitee shall provide written notice of
such direct Losses to the Indemnity Administrator within the applicable time
limits set forth in Section 10.5. The notice shall (i) describe the claim or
matter in reasonable detail, including the amount of such Losses (estimated if
appropriate) that have been or may be sustained by such Indemnitee and the
method of computation thereof, and (ii) contain a reference to the provisions
of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed
or arises; provided, however, that the failure to timely give such notice, or
to include the information and materials specified to be included in such
notice, shall not affect the rights of an Indemnitee hereunder, except to the
extent that such failure has an actual prejudicial effect on the amount of the
Losses, on the defenses or other rights available with respect to such claim
or on the ability to mitigate such claim. If the Indemnity Administrator does
not agree to the amount of Losses claimed by such Indemnitee and the parties
are not able to resolve such matter, then such Indemnitee shall be entitled to
submit such indemnification claim to any court or authority of  

  

 ![](agreementandplanofmerger101.jpg) 

SMRH:484497247.47 -96- SM01DOCS\\\1200417.35 competent jurisdiction described
in Section 11.2 for determination of the amount of Losses, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement. 10.7 Determination of Loss Amount.
The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under Section 10.2 and
Section 10.3 shall be calculated net of (i) any insurance proceeds (including
under the Parent RWI Policy) actually received or paid on behalf of the
prospective Indemnitee covering any of the Loss that is the subject to the
claim for indemnity (in each case, net of any costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the investigation or collection of such amounts by or on
behalf of such Indemnitee and net of any experience based premium adjustments)
actually and directly caused by Losses paid under such policies of insurance
for claims based upon facts and circumstances otherwise giving rise to
indemnifiable Losses hereunder, (ii) any net amounts recovered from other
collateral sources (such as contractual indemnities of any Person which are
contained outside of this Agreement) (in each case, net of any costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the investigation or collection of such
amounts by or on behalf of such Indemnitee); and (iii) any Tax benefits
actually realized (calculated on a "with and without" basis) by the party
being indemnified on account of such Loss, but only to the extent such Tax
benefit is realized in the year that such Loss was incurred. In the event any
Losses are recoverable under insurance policies or other collateral sources,
Parent Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts and
proceed in good faith to pursue recovery of such Losses under such insurance
policies or other collateral sources. In the event that an insurance or other
recovery is received by any Indemnitee or a Tax benefit is realized by an
Indemnitee in the year the Loss is incurred, in each case with respect to a
Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund
equal to the amount of the insurance or other recovery or Tax benefit shall be
made promptly to the Indemnity Administrator that made or directed such
indemnification payments to such Indemnitee; provided, that the Indemnitee
shall not be obligated to pay over any such amount or benefit in excess of the
amount actually received from the indemnifying Party with respect to such
claim. 10.8 Exclusive Remedy; Indemnification Escrow Fund. (a) Except for the
right of a party hereto to pursue specific performance pursuant to Section
11.9 (and without limitation of any such right) and except for the provisions
of Article VII, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, after the Closing, the
indemnification provisions in this Article X shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Affiliates against each other with respect to any claim related to or arising
from this Agreement, the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, the
performance by the Parties of their respective obligations hereunder, the
transactions contemplated hereby or any other matter relating to any of the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, the operation of their
respective businesses prior to the Closing, or any other transaction or state
of facts involving the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Article X shall not
limit any remedies or claims under the Ancillary Documents. (b) Once a claim
for indemnification by a Parent Indemnified Party brought in accordance with
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Article X or Section 7.1(b)
has been finally adjudicated on the merits to be payable to a Parent
Indemnified Party, or otherwise settled and resolved among such Parent
Indemnified Party and the Shareholder Representatives in writing,  

  

 ![](agreementandplanofmerger102.jpg) 

SMRH:484497247.47 -97- SM01DOCS\\\1200417.35 such Parent Indemnified Party
shall have the right to obtain recovery in satisfaction of any amounts owed to
it hereunder as follows: (i) with respect to claims pursuant to Section
10.2(a)(i), (A) first, from the Indemnification Escrow Fund, pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, (B) second, to the extent that the Parent RWI
Policy covers the loss, the carrier has not denied coverage, and the coverage
limit of the Parent RWI Policy has not been reached, then from the proceeds of
insurance pursuant to the terms of the Parent RWI Policy, and (C) thereafter,
to the extent that (x) the Parent RWI Policy does not cover the Loss, the
carrier has denied coverage or the coverage limit of the Parent RWI Policy has
been reached and (y) the Loss arises from fraud or a breach or inaccuracy of a
Company Fundamental Representation, Parent may seek the unreimbursed amount of
such Loss from the Former Holders of Company Capital Stock or Exchanged
Options solely to the extent of their respective Pro Rata Shares thereof,
subject to the applicable limitations and exclusions, if any, set forth
herein, provided, for purposes of clarity, for that portion of Loss pursuant
to claims under Section 10.2(a)(i) that do not satisfy the conditions of both
immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y), the sole recourse of Parent
Indemnified Parties for indemnification under Section 10.2(a)(i) shall be from
the Indemnification Escrow Fund; (ii) with respect to claims pursuant to
Section 7.1(b), (A) first, from the Indemnification Escrow Fund, pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, (B) second, but only up to the amount of
the then-applicable retention under the Parent RWI Policy, from the Former
Holders of Company Capital Stock or Exchanged Options solely to the extent of
their respective Pro Rata Shares thereof and subject to other applicable
limitations and exclusions, if any, set forth herein, (C) third, to the extent
that the Parent RWI Policy covers the loss, the carrier has not denied
coverage, and the coverage limit of the Parent RWI Policy has not been
reached, then from the proceeds of insurance pursuant to the terms of the
Parent RWI Policy, and (D) thereafter, Parent may seek the unreimbursed amount
of such Loss from the Former Holders of Company Capital Stock or Exchanged

delegate any or all of its obligations under this Agreement without the
express prior written consent of each other Party to this Agreement. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties to
this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any
attempted assignment in violation of this Section 0 shall be void. 11.7

time prior to the Closing, either the Company or Parent may (i) extend the
time for performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or the

Party with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument

Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement (or portions thereof) shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party hereto. If any provision of this Agreement (or any portion thereof)
shall be held to be so broad as to be invalid, broad or unenforceable, such
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. Upon a

Parties as closely as possible in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible. 11.9 Specific Performance. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable

or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and  

  

 ![](agreementandplanofmerger108.jpg) 

SMRH:484497247.47 -103- SM01DOCS\\\1200417.35 agree that, to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches by the Parties of any of their respective covenants or
obligations set forth in this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with such order or
injunction. The foregoing is in addition to any other remedy to which any
Party is entitled at law, in equity or otherwise. The Purchase Price is

terms and conditions set forth herein. The Parties further agree that nothing
set forth in this Section 11.9 shall require any party hereto to institute any
Action for (or limit any Party's right to institute any Action for) specific
performance under this Section 11.9 prior to or as a condition to exercising
any termination right under Article IX (and pursuing damages after such
termination). If any Party brings any Action to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other Party, the Outside
Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which

period established by the court presiding over such Action. The Parties hereto
agree that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall
be entitled to specific performance (or any other equitable relief) to cause
Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to effect the
Closing on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement. 11.10 No
Admission. Nothing herein (including in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
Parent Disclosure Schedule) shall be deemed an admission by the Company or any
of its Affiliates, in any Action or proceeding involving a third party, that
such third party is or is not in breach or violation of, or in default in, the
performance or observance of any term or provision of any contract. 11.11
Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each
of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by electronic mail
in portable document format (.pdf) or by facsimile shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 11.12

each Letter of Transmittal and each Option Termination Agreement shall provide
that the Shareholder Representatives shall be the exclusive agents and
