AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of June 10, 2005 by and among ValueClick, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Spider Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), Web Marketing Holdings, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and J. Alex Hartzler, an individual,
solely in his capacity as Stockholder Agent (as defined in _Section
7.2(h)_).   

RECITALS    

A. The Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
believe it is advisable and in the best interests of each company and their
respective stockholders that Parent acquire the Company through the statutory
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger") and, in
furtherance thereof, have approved the Merger, this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.   

B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, each issued and outstanding
share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Common Stock") and preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
the Company (the "Company Preferred Stock" and, together with the Company
Common Stock, the "Company Capital Stock"), shall be converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash only or both cash and shares of common stock of
Parent, par value $0.001 per share ("Parent Common Stock") determined
pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_, subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section
1.6(f)_ hereof and subject to the provisions of _Section 1.8_ hereof
pursuant to which a portion of the Merger Consideration allocable to the
holders of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the Merger will be deposited
into the Escrow Fund (as defined in  _Section 1.8_).   

C. Pursuant to the Merger, all outstanding options ("Company Options") to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time shall either be
terminated at the Effective Time or be assumed by Parent and shall become
exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock from and after the Effective
Time, as provided in _Section 1.6(b)_ below. Company Options for the purchase
of 454,470 shares of Company Common Stock as of the date hereof with an
initial exercise price of $0.04 per share are deemed to be "In-the-Money
Company Options" for purpose of this Agreement. All other Company Options
shall be deemed to be "Out-of-the-Money Company Options" for purposes of
the Agreement, subject to any different result as determined in accordance
with the definition of "Common Stock Amount" herein.   

D. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations
and warranties and other agreements in connection with the Merger.   

E. In recognition of the consideration receivable pursuant to the Agreement
and in connection with the purchase of all their respective shares of Company
Capital Stock pursuant to the Merger, certain individuals have agreed to
enter into a non-competition agreement with Parent substantially in the form
of _Exhibit A_ attached hereto (the "Non-Competition Agreement").   

F. As a condition and an inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement,
each stockholder of the Company (each, a "Stockholder" and collectively the
"Stockholders") has executed and delivered, and each party who hereafter
becomes a Stockholder will execute and deliver, irrevocable written consents
in the form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto (each, a "Written
Consent"), pursuant to which each such Stockholder has consented or will
consent to the adoption and approval of the Merger and this Agreement.   

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the covenants,
agreements, representations and warranties set forth herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties to this Agreement hereby agree as
follows:   

ARTICLE I    

THE MERGER    

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined in _Section 1.3_) and
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended
(the "DGCL") (a) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, (b)
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and (c)
the Company shall continue as the corporation surviving the Merger and as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Company as the corporation surviving
the Merger is sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation."   

1.2 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ , the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at
the offices of Parent at 30699 Russell Ranch Road, Suite 250, Westlake
Village, California 91361 as promptly as practicable following the
satisfaction or valid waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article
VI_, unless another place or time is agreed in writing by Parent and the
Company. The date the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the "Closing
Date."   

1.3 _Actions at the Closing_. At the Closing: (a) Parent and Merger Sub shall
deliver to the Company the various certificates, instruments and documents
referenced in _Section 6.2_ , (b) the Company shall deliver to Parent and
Merger Sub the various certificates, instruments and documents referenced in
_Section 6.3_ and (c) the parties hereto shall consummate the Merger by
filing the Certificate of Merger in the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto
(the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the time of
acceptance of such Certificate of Merger by the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware being referred to herein as the "Effective Time").   

1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.   

1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Officers and Directors_. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective
Time:   

(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall, without further
action, be amended and restated as set forth in Exhibit A to the Certificate
of Merger, and shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law;   

(b) the Bylaws of the Company shall, without further action, be amended and
restated to read the same as the Bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the
Effective Time, and shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law; and   

(c) the officers and directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall
become the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation, to serve as
such until the death, resignation, removal or replacement of such persons as
provided by law and the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.   

1.6 _Merger Consideration; Effect on Capital Stock_. The aggregate
maximum consideration to be paid to the Stockholders by Parent and Merger Sub
for all the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock and rights to acquire
Company Capital Stock at the Closing shall be $140,000,000 in cash and shares
of Parent Common Stock minus (i) the amount of any outstanding debt of the
Company and its subsidiaries (the "Debt Amount") under that certain Revolving
Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement dated May 18, 2004 among the
Company, its subsidiaries and CapitalSource Finance LLC (the "CapitalSource
Debt"), (ii) Third Party Expenses of the Company in the amount set forth on
the Third Party Expense Schedule, and (iii) the Option Cancellation Price (as
defined in _Section 1.6(c)_, and subject to further adjustment as provided in
_Section 1.6(f)_ (such amount, as adjusted, the "Merger Consideration"), and
subject to the deposit of a portion of the Merger Consideration into the
Escrow Fund as provided in _Section 1.8_. Of the Merger Consideration, a
portion shall consist of cash (such amount, as adjusted, the
"Cash Consideration") and the remainder shall consist of shares of Parent
Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration"), in the amounts and allocated among
the Stockholders as set forth in the Final Schedule 1.6(a). For the purposes
of determining the number of shares of Parent Common Stock included in the
Stock Consideration, each share of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at
$10.22, the weighted average closing price of one share of Parent Common
Stock on the NASDAQ National Market over the 5 trading day period ending on
the trading day before the date hereof (the "Average Price"). Attached hereto
as Schedule 1.6 (a)(1) is an estimate of the Third Party Expenses. On the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Stockholders, the following shall
occur:   

(a) _Company Capital Stock_. Each outstanding share of Company Capital
Stock automatically will be converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash or a combination of cash and Parent Common Stock, as set forth on Final
Schedule 1.6(a). In the case of shares of Company Preferred Stock, the
payment set forth on Schedule 1.6(a) represents the Preference Amount. A
preliminary calculation of Schedule 1.6(a) is attached hereto. Upon
confirmation of the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the
Stockholders as of the Closing Date after taking into consideration all
adjustments contemplated by this _Section 1.6_, including _Section 1.6(f)_
and _1.6(g)_ , Parent and the Company shall prepare and agree upon an
updated Schedule 1.6(a) as of the Closing Date, which shall be subject to
Parents reasonable approval (the "Final Schedule 1.6(a)"). Each Stockholder
acknowledged in the Written Consent that each Stockholder may be receiving a
different combination of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock in the
Merger, and each Stockholder thereby acknowledged and agreed to the
allocations set forth on Schedule 1.6(a).   

(b) _Company Options_. Each In-the-Money Company Option outstanding at the
Effective Time shall be terminated by the Company as of the Effective Time in
exchange for payment by the Company of such In-the-Money Company Options pro
rata share of the Option Cancellation Price, as set forth on Schedule 1.6(a).
Parent and the Company agree to treat the payment for tax purposes as not
allocable to the portion of the day after the Effective Time. Each Out-of-the-
Money Company Option outstanding at the Effective Time shall be deemed
assumed by Parent, and from and after the Effective Time, (i) each
outstanding Out-of-the Money Company Option shall entitle the holder thereof
to acquire the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Out-of-the Money Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio and
(ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock subject to such
assumed Out-of-the Money Company Options at and after the Effective Time
shall be an amount (rounded up to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) equal
to (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to the
Out-of-the Money Company Option prior to the Effective Time divided by (B)
the Option Exchange Ratio. Other than as provided above and except as
provided in the relevant Company Option agreement, each assumed Out-of-the
Money Company Option shall be subject to the same vesting schedule and other
terms and conditions for such Company Option as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time. A calculation of the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock and revised exercise price applicable to the Out-of-the-Money Company
Options as of the Effective Time shall be provided on Schedule 1.6(b) as of
the Closing Date (which Schedule 1.6(b) shall be subject to Parents
reasonable approval).    

For purposes hereof:   

(A) "Common Stock Amount" means (x) the Merger Consideration minus the
Preference Amount divided by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time, including the number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by the Conversion Amount of the
Company Preferred Stock, as such term is defined in the Companys Certificate
of Incorporation immediately prior to the Effective Time (such number, the
"Common Participation Amount" and, together with the Company Common Stock,
the "Common Equity"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if upon the delivery of
the Final Working Capital Calculation, the Company Options deemed to be "Out-
of-the-Money Company Options" are not out-of-the-money based on the per share
value of the consideration to be received by holders of Common Equity in the
Merger, then the Common Stock Amount will be recalculated such that a number
of such Company Options are included in the Common Equity determined using
the treasury stock method;   

(B) "Option Exchange Ratio" means the quotient obtained by dividing the Common
Stock Amount plus $7 million by the Average Price.   

(C) "Preference Amount" means the amount of Merger Consideration payable with
respect to the Liquidation Value of the shares of Company Preferred Stock (as
such term is defined in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and including accrued but
unpaid dividends) outstanding as of the Effective Time (valuing the
Stock Consideration at the Average Price), as specified on Schedule
1.6(a).   

(D) "Option Cancellation Price" means (prior to reduction for tax withholding)
the aggregate price to be paid, including employer payroll tax, to cause the
termination in accordance with the Initial Pool Plan of all In-the-Money
Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company acting in good
faith, subject to Parents approval of the price as so determined. A
calculation of the Option Cancellation Price is attached hereto as Schedule
1.6(b)(1) (which Schedule 1.6(b)(1) shall be updated as of the Effective Time
in accordance with this _Section 1.6_, and subject to Parents reasonable
approval.   

(c) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued by virtue of the Merger, and no
dividend, stock split or other distribution with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall relate to any such fractional interest, and any such fractional
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of
a security holder. In lieu thereof, Parent shall pay to the holder of shares
of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock, as soon as practicable after the Effective Date
(and in the same manner required for delivery of cash and certificates of
Parent Common Stock provided in _Section 1.9_), an amount in cash equal
to such fraction multiplied by the Average Price.   

(d) _Merger Sub Stock_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding
as of the Effective Time automatically shall be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, each stock certificate
formerly representing shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed to
represent an equivalent number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.    

(e) _Adjustments for Subsequent Changes_.   

(i) The amount of cash payable with respect to the Company Capital Stock
pursuant to  _Section 1.6_ shall be equitably and appropriately adjusted to
reflect any stock split, reverse split, stock combination, stock dividend,
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other like change with
respect to the Company Capital Stock which occurs after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.   

(ii) If, after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into or
exchanged for a different number of shares or kind of shares and/or other
securities of Parent or another corporation or entity by reason of any
reclassification, split-up, stock dividend or stock combination or any
arrangement, amalgamation or similar statutory procedure (an "Adjustment
Event"), then the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered as
the Stock Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted so that each holder
of Certificates shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time, in lieu of
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock provided for in this _Section
1.6_, such number and kind of shares and/or other securities as such holder
would have received if the record date and payment date for such Adjustment
Event had been immediately after the Effective Time.   

(f) _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. The amount of Merger Consideration paid
to the Stockholders shall be subject to (i) downward adjustment, on a dollar
for dollar basis, to the extent that Working Capital is less than $2,400,000
as of the Closing Date or (ii) upward adjustment, on a dollar for dollar
basis, to the extent that Working Capital is more than $2,400,000 as of the
Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, "Working Capital" is defined
as (i) total current assets (as defined under United States generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")) of the Company and its subsidiaries
on a combined basis, _less_ (ii) the sum of (A) total liabilities (as defined
under GAAP) of the Company and its subsidiaries on a combined basis
(other than the CapitalSource Debt and the Option Cancellation Price deducted
from the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 1.6_ and other
than the line item entitled Dividend Payable on the Working Capital
Calculation, which is included in the Preference Amount) not paid by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, (B) all fees, costs and expenses incurred
by the Company, including Third Party Expenses, legal fees, financial advisor
fees (including of the type described in _Section 2.19_), employee bonuses
and severance benefits (including related payroll taxes) incurred in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or resulting from
the Merger not paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time and not
deducted from the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 1.6_,
(C) all anticipated costs of the Audit (as defined in _Section 5.1(a)_) not
paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time and (D) all of the fees,
costs and expenses associated with preparing and filing any Tax Returns (as
defined in  _Section 2.8_) not timely filed prior to the Effective Time, and
all unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes (including, in each case, accountants and
attorneys fees and the amount of any required payments for Pre-Closing
Taxes, any penalties and additions to tax, and any interest thereon), but only
to the extent such amounts described in this clause (D) exceed the amount
reserved for Pre-Closing Taxes set forth on the Closing Date Working Capital
Calculation and included in the liabilities of the Company under clause (A)
above. For the avoidance of doubt, no particular liability or cost shall be
counted more than once when determining the amount to subtract pursuant to
clause (ii) above. To facilitate and expedite the calculation of any
necessary adjustments to the Merger Consideration, the Company has prepared
and delivered on the date hereof a calculation of the amount of Working
Capital as of the date hereof (the "Preliminary Working Capital
Calculation") certified by the Companys Chief Financial Officer as true and
correct, and, immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide a
similarly certified update of such calculation as of the Closing Date (the
"Closing Date Working Capital Calculation"). To the extent that Working
Capital as reflected in the Closing Date Working Capital Calculation is less
than $2,400,000, the Merger Consideration payable to the Stockholders
pursuant to _Section 1.6_ shall be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by
such shortfall and the amount of Merger Consideration payable to
each Stockholder upon conversion of such Stockholders Company Common Stock
as set forth on Schedule 1.6(a) shall be reduced in proportion to the
percentage that the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to such
Stockholder on account of such Stockholders shares of Company Common
Stock (including the Preferred Participation Amount), as specified on
Schedule 1.6(a), bears to the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to all
Stockholders on account of all Stockholders Common Equity. Conversely, to
the extent that Working Capital as reflected in the Closing Date
Working Capital Calculation is more than $2,400,000, the Merger Consideration
payable to the Stockholders pursuant to _Section 1.6_ shall be increased on
a dollar-for-dollar basis by such excess and the amount of Merger
Consideration payable to each Stockholder upon conversion of
such Stockholders Company Common Stock (including the Preferred
Participation Amount) as set forth on Schedule 1.6(a) shall be increased in
proportion to the percentage that the Merger Consideration otherwise payable
to such Stockholder on account of such Stockholders shares of Company
Common Stock, as specified on Schedule 1.6(a), bears to the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable to all Stockholders on account of all Stockholders
Common Equity.   

(g) In the event that Parent reasonably determines that Section 2.2(a) or
Section 2.2(c) of the Company Schedule as delivered to Parent as of the date
hereof is untrue or incorrect in any respect, or that the Out-of-the-Money
Options are not out-of-the-money, as described in the definition of Common
Stock Amount: (i) prior to the time any payment of Merger Consideration
or Option Cancellation Price is made to any Stockholder or holder of Company
Options, then the amounts payable to each Stockholder upon conversion of such
Stockholders Company Capital Stock as set forth on Schedule 1.6(a), the
amount of the Option Cancellation Price payable to holders of In-the-Money
Company Options and the Option Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted by Parent to
account for the difference in the number of outstanding shares of Capital
Stock or outstanding Company Stock Options (in proportion to the
Proportionate Interests) so that (x) the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Equity does not exceed
the amount of $140,000,000, less the Debt Amount, the Option Cancellation
Price and the Third Party Expenses listed on the Third Party Expense Schedule
and taking into account any adjustment made pursuant to _Section 1.6(f_),
preserving to the extent possible the proportions of cash and shares of
Parent Common Stock payable to each such Stockholder and (y) the amount
payable on account of In-the-Money Company Options does not exceed the Option
Cancellation Price; or (ii) after the time any payment is of Merger
Consideration is made to any Stockholder or holder of Company Options, Parent
shall be entitled to make a claim pursuant to and in accordance with Article
VII.    

1.7 _Dissenting Shares_.   

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Capital Stock held by a Stockholder who has properly
exercised and perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with
the DGCL and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights
("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6_, but the holder
thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are expressly specified in
Section 262 of the DGCL. Nothing in this  _Section 1.7_ shall be deemed to
affect Parents right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_
or to close the Merger and seek recovery of any Losses (as provided in 
_Article VII_) if any Stockholder at any time retains or asserts appraisal
rights or fails to deliver, or subsequently withdraws or revokes, a Written
Consent to the Merger.   

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1.7(a)_, if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose such holders appraisal
rights (by failing to properly perfect the same or otherwise), then, as of
the occurrence of such event, such holders shares of Company Capital Stock
automatically shall be converted into and represent the right to receive
only its share of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.6_, in
each case without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates
representing such shares.   

(c) The Company shall give Parent and the Stockholder Agent (i) prompt notice
of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the
applicable provisions of the DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily
make any payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or
settle any such demands. To the extent that Parent or the Company makes any
payment in respect of any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall be entitled to
recover from the Escrow Fund (as defined below), pursuant to the claim
for Losses provisions of _Article VII_ hereof, the aggregate amounts by
which any such Dissenting Shares payments exceed the aggregate Merger
Consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such
Dissenting Shares.   

1.8 _Establishment of Escrow; Interest and Dividends_. At the Effective Time,
on behalf of the Stockholders identified as participating in the Escrow Fund
on Schedule 1.6 (the "Escrow Stockholders"), Parent shall deposit into a
general escrow account established pursuant to  _Article VII_ below (the
"Escrow Fund") $4,556,758 of the Merger Consideration (such amount, as
increased and decreased by deposits (including interest and dividends) and
withdrawals pursuant to this Agreement from time to time, the "Escrow
Amount"). The Escrow Amount shall be maintained in a separate account and
disbursed as provided in _Article VII_. The portion of the Escrow Amount
deposited on behalf of each Escrow Stockholder shall be in proportion to the
percentage that the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to such
Stockholder on account of such Escrow Stockholders shares of Company Common
Stock, including the Common Participation Amount on account of such Escrow
Stockholders shares of Company Preferred Stock, as specified on Final
Schedule 1.6(a), bears to the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to all
Escrow Stockholders on account of their Common Equity (such percentage
interests, the "Proportionate Interests") and, with respect to those Escrow
Stockholders entitled to receive both cash and shares of Parent Common Stock,
both cash and shares of Parent Common Stock will be withheld in proportion to
the amount of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise payable to
such Escrow Stockholder. For all purposes of the Escrow Fund, each share of
Parent Common Stock shall be valued at the Average Price.    

1.9 _Surrender of Certificates; Payment of Merger Consideration_.   

(a) _Merger Consideration_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall have available,
in immediately available funds and shares of Parent Common Stock reserved for
issuance, the amount of the Merger Consideration less the Escrow Amount (
_less_ any amounts otherwise payable with respect to any Dissenting Shares)
for payment to the Stockholders entitled thereto as provided below.
In addition, at the Effective Time, Parent shall separately deposit the
Escrow Amount into the Escrow Fund on behalf of the Escrow Stockholders
otherwise entitled thereto, as provided in _Section 1.8_. In addition, in a
special payroll distribution by the Surviving Corporation promptly after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall administer the payment to the
holders of In-the-Money Company Options of their pro rata portion of the
Option Cancellation Price as set forth on Final Schedule 1.6(a).   

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. At or after the Closing, each holder of record
of outstanding Company Capital Stock (the instruments representing the same,
"Certificates") shall deliver to Parent (i) a properly completed and validly
executed letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_
and (ii) the Certificates representing all shares of Company Capital Stock
held by such Stockholder, duly endorsed in blank. Upon surrender of a
Certificate to Parent, together with a duly completed and validly executed
letter of transmittal, the surrendering Stockholder shall be paid by Parent,
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the date of proper
surrender and cancellation of a Certificate, the amount of Merger
Consideration to which such Stockholder is entitled as determined pursuant to
_Section 1.6_ ( _less_ amounts deposited in the Escrow Fund on behalf of an
Escrow Stockholder pursuant to _Section 1.8_ and subject to _Article VII_).
From and after the Effective Time, until properly surrendered and cancelled,
each outstanding Certificate will be deemed to evidence only the right to
receive the portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of each
such share pursuant to the Merger as set forth on Final Schedule 1.6(a)
(subject to _Section 1.8_ and _Article VII_). As provided in the letter of
transmittal, by executing and delivering the same, each Stockholder will (A)
acknowledge and agree to perform the obligations attributed to such
Stockholder hereunder, (B) for each Escrow Stockholder, acknowledge and agree
to the indemnification and other obligations set forth in _Article VII_ and
Parents and its affiliates right to recover any Losses out of the Escrow
Fund and (C) for each Escrow Stockholder, approve and confirm the appointment
of the Stockholder Agent.   

(c) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid or
allocated to a person other than the holder in whose name the Certificate
surrendered is registered, it will be a condition of the payment or
allocation thereof that the Certificate so surrendered must be properly
endorsed and accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence compliance with any applicable securities laws and
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.   

(d) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article
I_, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
to any Stockholder for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   

1.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration issued pursuant to the Merger or deposited into the Escrow Fund
shall be deemed to have been issued in full payment and satisfaction of all
rights or obligations pertaining thereto. There shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of any
shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason after the Effective Time, such Certificates
immediately shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
I_ (subject to _Sections 1.8_ and _Article VII_).   

1.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificates have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall pay such amount ( _less_ any amounts
deposited into the Escrow Fund on behalf of the holder) as otherwise would be
required pursuant to this _Article I_ in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates promptly following receipt of an affidavit in a form
satisfactory to Parent of that fact; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to such payment or
issuance require the purported owner of any such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond (at such owners sole cost and expense) in
such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   

1.12 _Necessary Actions; Further Action_. If any further action is necessary
or desirable at any time after the Effective Time to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub
in the Surviving Corporation or to vest Parent with a 100% ownership interest
in the Surviving Corporation, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of the Company and the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to take, and the Surviving Corporation
shall reasonably cause such persons to take, all such lawful, necessary or
desirable action so long as such action is not inconsistent with
this Agreement.   

1.13 _Required Deductions and Withholding; Payment of Taxes_. The Company,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable or deliverable
to any Stockholder such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or pursuant to any
other applicable legal requirement. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld and remitted, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid absent such deduction or withholding.   

1.14. _Accounting and Tax Treatment_. The Merger is intended to constitute a
purchase of the Company for purposes of GAAP, and as a taxable purchase of
the Company Capital Stock for federal and applicable state income tax
purposes.   

1.15 _Fluctuations in Market Price of Parent Common Stock_. Parent, the
Company and the Stockholders acknowledge that the market price of the Parent
Common Stock may fluctuate significantly. The potential risk of increases or
decreases in the price of Parent Common Stock has been taken into account in
connection with the negotiation of the amount of cash and Parent Common Stock
to which certain Stockholders will be entitled in the Merger and the
conditions on which they will become so entitled.

of the Company Schedule sets forth each jurisdiction in which the Company or
any subsidiary is qualified, registered, licensed or admitted to do business
as a foreign corporation. The Company has made available to Parent true and
correct copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws or other

rights to acquire the same).   

(c) _Company Options_. Section 2.2(c) of the Company Schedule sets forth a
list of all outstanding Company Options, including the names and positions of
the respective holders thereof, the number and type of securities issuable

made available to Parent true and correct copies of the Company Plans and all
agreements and arrangements related to or issued under the Company Plans, in
each case as amended to date and in effect. There are no currently pending or

accordance with the terms of the Company Plans.   

(d) _No Other Derivative Securities or Rights_. Except for the Company
Options and Company Preferred Stock and pursuant to the Stockholders
Agreement, there are no oral or written options, warrants, puts, calls,
preemptive rights, rights of first or last refusal, rights of negotiation,

redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, purchased, repurchased or
redeemed, any shares of the Companys capital stock or other securities or

outstanding.   

2.3 _Subsidiaries_. The Company is the owner of all outstanding shares of
capital stock of each of its subsidiaries and all such shares (a) have been
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and (b) except

or similar rights. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or exercisable or convertible securities or
other commitments, transactions, arrangements, or agreements (other than this
Agreement) of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock
or other securities of any such subsidiary, or otherwise obligating the
Company or any such subsidiary to issue, transfer, sell, purchase,
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities.    

2.4 _Authority_.   

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and any other agreements or instruments attached as
Exhibits hereto or delivered pursuant to this Agreement to which the Company
is or will be a party (all such agreements or instruments, collectively, the
"Ancillary Agreements"), to observe and perform its obligations hereunder
and thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, subject only to the requisite approval of the Merger and this
Agreement by the Stockholders pursuant to the Written Consents. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by the Company,
the observance and performance of the Companys obligations hereunder and
thereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate or
other action on the part of the Company, and no further or other action of
the Company or its Board of Directors or stockholders is required with respect
to the foregoing. This Agreement has been (and each Ancillary Agreement upon
the execution and delivery thereof will be) duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company, and each constitutes (or will constitute upon
execution and delivery) a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its respective terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by principles of public policy and
subject to the laws of general application relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraud, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating
to or affecting creditors generally and the relief of debtors and rules of
law governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
remedies (the "Equitable Exceptions").   

(b) The only votes required for the Companys stockholders to duly approve the
Merger and this Agreement under the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the
Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws is the affirmative
vote of the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, voting together on an as
converted basis. Other than the Stockholders Agreement, the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation and the Companys Bylaws, the Company is not a
party or subject to any agreement, arrangement or understanding and, to the
Companys knowledge, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding that
restricts or relates to voting (other than the Written Consents executed and
delivered by the Stockholders prior to the date hereof and any Written
Consents which hereafter will be executed and delivered as required hereby),
giving of written consents, dividend rights or restrictions on transfer of
any Company or subsidiary voting securities, including any voting trust or any
valid and outstanding or irrevocable proxy agreement or arrangement.   

(c) Except as set forth on Section 2.4 of the Company Schedule, the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by the Company
does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of, or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both), require consent of any third party under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any
benefit under:    

(i) any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the
Company; or   

(ii) any mortgage, indenture, lease, Contract or instrument (in each case,
subject to the Company obtaining all Requisite Consents (as defined in
_Section 2.12_) relating to such agreements and instruments), permit,
concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law,
ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, its subsidiaries or
any of their properties or assets, or by which the Company or any subsidiary
is a party; or

they are required to have filed. All Tax Returns filed by the Company and its

predecessor provision or comparable provision of state, local or foreign
law). To the extent the Company did not file a Tax Return in any jurisdiction
or for any specific period, the Company did so because it had no liability

due or payable as of the date thereof, except for such Taxes that,
individually or in the aggregate, are not material. The Company and its
subsidiaries have no material liability for Taxes, other than Taxes reflected

subsidiaries.

other Governmental Entity has proposed any such adjustment or a change in any
accounting method used by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Company
and its subsidiaries use the accrual method of accounting for federal income
tax purposes. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has taken any
action inconsistent with its practices in prior years that would have the
effect of deferring a liability for Taxes from a period prior to the Effective

Section 355 or 361 of the Code.   

(xiv) Each Company Option identified as an ISO in Section 2.2(c) of the

of the Company Schedule, there is no Contract and there is no judgment,
injunction, order or decree of any Governmental Entity (an "Order") to which

material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to review any material communication
given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or
conference with, or any such other governmental authority or, in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person. Parent shall
pay the filing fees associated with the filing of Notification and Report
Forms relating to the transactions contemplated hereby as required by the HSR
Act.   

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent shall not be
required to agree to any divestiture by Parent, the Company or any of
Parents or the Companys subsidiaries or affiliates of shares of capital
stock or any business, assets or property, or the imposition of
any limitation on the ability of any such persons to conduct their respective
businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock
either prior to or following the Merger.    

5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_.   

(a) _General Notices_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence
of which is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of the
Company contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to
the Effective Time in any material respect (not taking into account
any materiality qualifiers in such representations or warranties) or any
failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by the
Company hereunder. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which is reasonably likely to cause any representation or
warranty of Parent contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at
or prior to the Effective Time in any material respect (not taking into
account any materiality qualifiers in such representations or warranties) or
any failure of the Parent to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 5.6_ shall not act as a waiver of or limit or otherwise
affect any remedies available to the party receiving such notice by virtue of
the events or circumstances referenced in such notice.   

(b) _Intellectual Property Notices; IP Assignments_. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice if any person shall have (i) commenced, or shall have
notified the Company that it intends to commence, an action or proceeding or
(ii) provided the Company with notice, in either case which allege(s) that
any of the Company Intellectual Property currently embodied, or proposed to
be embodied, in the Company Platforms or Company Offerings or utilized in
Company-designed or modified development tools (including standard cells) or
design environments infringes or otherwise violates the intellectual property
rights of such person, is available for licensing from a potential licensor
providing the notice or otherwise alleges that the Company does not
otherwise own or have the right to use and exploit such Company Intellectual
Property (the foregoing, an "Infringement Claim"). The Company shall
reasonably cooperate with Parent in making arrangements, prior to the Closing
Date, satisfactory to Parent in its sole and reasonable discretion to
effect any necessary or appropriate assignments (as determined by Parent) to
the Surviving Corporation of all Company Intellectual Property or other
intellectual property rights owned or licensed by the Company or created by
the Companys founders, employees, consultants and independent
contractors, including any Company Intellectual Property or other
intellectual property rights created by the Companys founders prior to the
Companys incorporation, and to obtain the cooperation of such persons to
complete all Company Intellectual Property in the name of the Surviving
Corporation at the Companys or the Surviving Corporations expense (each, an
"IP Assignment"). The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to maintain, perfect, preserve or renew the Company Intellectual Property
through the Effective Time, including the payment of any
registration, maintenance, renewal fees, annuity fees and taxes or the filing
of any documents, applications or certificates related thereto, and to
promptly respond and prepare to respond to all requests, related to the
Company Intellectual Property, received from Governmental Entities. At the
Closing, the Company will notify Parent of all actions which must be taken
within the 180 days following the Closing Date and which are necessary to
maintain, perfect, preserve or renew any Company Intellectual Property (and
applications or registrations with respect to the same), including
the payment of any registration, maintenance, renewal fees, annuity fees and
taxes or the filing of any documents, applications or certificates related
thereto.    

5.7 _Other Covenants_.   

(a) _Third Party Expenses_. The Company shall cause all Third Party Expenses
(as defined in _Section 8.3_) to be invoiced on or prior to the Closing Date

Section 2.2(a) of the Company Schedule at the Closing current as of the
Closing Date.   

(c) _Copies of Board and Stockholder Actions_. The Company shall promptly
provide Parent copies of all minutes of any meetings, and actions by written
consent, of the Board of Directors of the Company and any subsidiaries
thereof (provided, that the Company may redact any competitive or pricing
information contained in such minutes or written consents to the
extent providing such information to Parent would violate Applicable Law),
and a written record of the proceedings of any meetings or actions by written
consent of the stockholders of the Company and any subsidiaries thereof,
which transpire or are executed after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time.   

(d) _New Stockholders_. Each person who becomes a Stockholder after the date

the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(including the Merger).

be issued in a private placement pursuant to an exemption from registration
under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act in accordance with this _Section 5.8_.
Each of the Stockholders receiving Parent Common Stock in the Merger
has executed and delivered to Parent a Representation, Lockup and Release
Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_.   

5.9. _NASDAQ Listings_ _._ Parent shall take all such actions as may be
necessary to ensure that the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the
Merger are quoted on the NASDAQ National Market as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time.   

5.10. _Form S-8_. Parent shall file a Registration Statement on Form S-8 with
the SEC covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to
Company Options as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event more than 15 business days after the Effective Time) and
will use all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement thereafter for so long as any of such Company
Options remain outstanding (and in any event shall use no less effort to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement than efforts used
to maintain the effectiveness of other Registration Statements on Form S-8 of
Parent).   

5.11. _Registration Rights_. At the Closing, Parent and the Escrow
Stockholders shall enter into a Registration Rights Agreement in
substantially the form of _Exhibit G_ hereto (the "Registration Rights
Agreement").   

5.12. _Indemnification Provisions_. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will fulfill and honor the obligations of the Company
to its directors pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in the
Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as in effect on the date

5.13 _Certain Tax Matters_.   

(a) _Tax Audits and Controversies_. Parent shall notify Stockholder Agent in
writing of the receipt by Parent, the Company or its subsidiaries of notice
of any proposed or actual adjustment or assessment with respect to Taxes that
can reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for indemnification to
Parent under the provisions of Article VII ("Tax Notice"), and shall provide
Stockholder Agent with all material correspondence with respect to such Tax
Notice;  _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to provide such Tax Notice or
correspondence shall not limit Parents rights to indemnity pursuant to
Article VII except to the extent that the Stockholders are materially
prejudiced by such failure. Following receipt of the Tax Notice, Stockholder
Agent shall have the right, at his sole cost and expense without reimbursement
from the Escrow Fund, to participate in any audit, examination, claim,
assessment or other proceeding pertaining solely to the Taxes at issue in
such Tax Notice. The provisions of _Section 7.2(j)_ regarding conduct and
settlement of third party claims shall apply to any proposed or actual
adjustments or assessments for Taxes with respect to a Tax Notice.   

(b) _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, each of Stockholder
Agent and Parent shall cooperate as reasonably requested (with out-of-pocket
costs borne by the requesting party) in preparing for any audits or
examinations of, or any disputes with Tax authorities regarding, any Tax
Returns of any of the Company and its subsidiaries for any Tax period
beginning prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall not be required to furnish any information unrelated to the Tax issue
for which indemnity hereunder could be sought or any information that it
considers confidential.   

(c) _Record Retention_. Parent shall use reasonable efforts to prevent the
destruction of material Tax records of the Company and its subsidiaries
pertaining to Tax periods beginning prior to the Closing Date until the
expiration of Parents right to indemnity pursuant to Article VII.

ARTICLE VII    

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ESCROW    

7.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. All representations and
warranties in this Agreement or in the certificates delivered pursuant to
_Section 6.3(i), 6.3(k)_ _and 6.3(l)_ this Agreement and any other claims
that may be made pursuant to this Article VII shall survive the Merger and
continue until the date that is eighteen (18) months after the
Effective Time, except that claims with respect to any breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 2.11_ shall survive
until the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the Effective Time and
claims with respect to any breach of the representations and warranties
set forth in _Section 2.2_, _Section 2.8_, _Section 2.20_ or for Pre-
Closing Taxes shall survive until the date that is thirty-six (36) months
after the Effective Time.    

7.2 _Indemnity and Escrow Arrangements_.   

(a) _Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations provided for herein, each
Escrow Stockholder (but not any Stockholder that is not an Escrow
Stockholder) hereby agrees severally to indemnify and hold harmless Parent
and its affiliates from and against any and all claims, losses, costs,
expenses, liabilities, judgments, fines, awards, penalties, sanctions or other
damages, including lost profits resulting from any injunction or legal
challenge that results in a substantial inability of Parent to operate the
Companys business or use the Company Intellectual Property and including any
settlement costs, reasonable attorneys fees and costs of investigation and
preparation, and interest on any cash disbursements made by Parent or its
affiliates in connection with any of the foregoing at a rate of 4% per annum
(any and all such amounts, collectively, "Losses") which Parent or any of its
affiliates suffers or incurs or reasonably anticipates suffering or incurring
by reason, directly or indirectly, of:   

(i) any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in or breach by the Company of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained
herein or in any Ancillary Agreement or in any document or instrument
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto;   

(ii) any inaccuracy in the calculation, or the actual amount, of the Working
Capital as of the Closing Date or in the Third Party Expense Schedule;   

(iii) any Losses resulting from any material misstatement or omission of, by
or relating to the Company in any materials delivered by or with the
knowledge of the Company in connection with soliciting or obtaining any
Written Consents from the Stockholders;   

(iv) any amounts per share required to be paid in satisfaction of appraisal
rights to the extent greater than the amounts to which any dissenting
Stockholders would be entitled pursuant to the Merger (and including any
Losses associated with any proceedings or settlement entered into
to determine or settle the amount payable to dissenting Stockholders);   

(v) any Pre-Closing Taxes to the extent such Pre-Closing Taxes exceed the
amount of Pre-Closing Taxes that reduced Working Capital in the Closing Date
Working Capital Calculation, as finally determined; and   

(vi) any Losses of Parent or the Surviving Corporation relating to any actions
taken by the Stockholder Agent hereunder or pursuant hereto.   

For purposes of this _Article VII_ "Losses" also shall include a reasonable
amount of legal fees and costs to be advanced to Parent in connection with
demonstrating, collecting or defending against actions or claims based on any
of the items specified in clauses _(i)_ through  _(vi)_ above. Such legal
costs and expenses are expressly authorized to be advanced to Parent
reasonably in advance of Parent actually incurring such Losses; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Parent shall promptly refund to the Escrow Fund any amounts
so advanced to the extent that the claim is subsequently determined not to be
an indemnifiable claim hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, "Losses" shall not include any amounts for which Parent or its
affiliates are actually reimbursed under any insurance policy of the Company
and its subsidiaries for which the premium was fully paid by the Company
prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of indemnification obligations
hereunder and the calculation of Losses pursuant to  _Article VII_, any
inaccuracy in or breach of a representation of warranty shall be deemed
to constitute a breach of such representation or warranty, notwithstanding
any limitation or qualification as to materiality set forth in such
representation or warranty as to the scope, accuracy or completeness thereof,
it being the intention of the parties that, subject only to the provisions of
_Section 7.2(c)_, Parent and its affiliates shall be indemnified and
held harmless from and against any and all Losses arising out of or based
upon or with respect to the failure of any such representation or warranty to
be true, correct and complete in any respect.   

(b) _Escrow Fund_. At the Effective Time, without any act of the Company or
any Stockholder, Parent will deposit the Escrow Amount into an escrow account
with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the "Escrow Agent"), such deposit to establish
and constitute the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund shall be governed by the
terms set forth in this _Section 7.2_ and an escrow agreement substantially
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit K_ (the "Escrow Agreement").
Parent shall pay one-half of the costs and expenses related to the
establishment and maintenance of the Escrow Fund and the Escrow Stockholders
shall pay one-half of such costs and expenses. The cash portion of the Escrow
Amount shall be deposited into an interest bearing account and any
interest earned thereon shall be added to the Escrow Fund and available to
cover Losses of Parent and its affiliates hereunder. Any distributions on the
shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund other than regular cash
dividends shall be held by the Escrow Agent and shall be deemed attached to
the shares of Parent Common Stock to which they pertain. For applicable income
tax purposes, any dividends, interest or other income earned on the Escrow
Fund shall be treated as income of the Escrow Stockholder on whose behalf
such securities or assets giving rise to such interest or other income, as
the case may be, are being held. The Escrow Stockholders shall not have the
right to sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any cash
or securities held in the Escrow Fund or any interest therein for so long as
they are held in the Escrow Fund. Each Escrow Stockholder shall be entitled
to vote the shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund for so long
as they are held by the Escrow Agent, pro rata based on the value of the
shares of Parent Common Stock deposited in the Escrow Fund on behalf of such
Escrow Stockholder. For purposes of determining the value of any shares of
Parent Common Stock included in the Escrow Fund, each such share shall be
deemed to have a value equal to the Average Price. Any amounts distributed to
Parent from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Article VII shall be taken pro
rata from the value of the amount in the Escrow Fund on account of each Escrow
Stockholder (valuing any shares of Parent Common Stock at the Average Price),
first from the cash included in the Escrow Fund on account of such Escrow
Stockholder and second from any shares of Parent Common Stock held in the
Escrow Fund on account of such Escrow Stockholder.    

(c) _Recourse to the Escrow Fund; Limitations_.   

(i) Subject to the provisions of this Article VII, Parent, on behalf of itself
and its affiliates, shall be entitled to withdraw amounts from the Escrow
Amount to compensate Parent and its affiliates for 31% of any Losses which
Parent or any of its affiliates suffers as provided above (such 31% amount of
any Loss, the "Indemnifiable Amount" of such Loss). The decision to withdraw
amounts from the Escrow Fund is at Parents discretion, and Parent may
determine to seek recovery for the Indemnifiable Amount of any Losses, in
whole or in part, at any time, subject to the provisions of this _Article
VII_. Notwithstanding this _Article VII_ or anything to the contrary herein,
nothing in this Agreement shall limit or waive the liability of the
Company for any Losses or damages incurred or sustained by Parent if the
Merger does not close. Following the Effective Time, the sole and exclusive
remedy for any Losses incurred by Parent or its affiliates incurred as a
result of any breach by the Company of a representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement shall be indemnification pursuant to
this Article VII, _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not be
deemed a waiver by any party of any right or remedy arising by reason of any
claim of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or actual concealment. Parent
may not receive any amounts from the Escrow Fund unless and until
Parent delivers an Officers Certificate (as defined in subparagraph _(e)_
below) to the Escrow Agent as described in subparagraph _(e)_ below.   

(ii) Except in the case of (A) indemnification under _Sections 7.2(a)(ii)_,
_(iv)_  or _(v)_ , (B) Losses arising out of or in connection with a breach
of the representations in  _Sections 2.1_, _2.2_ , _2.4_ , _2.8_ and _2.19_
and (C) fraud, intentional misrepresentation or actual concealment, no Escrow
Stockholder shall have any obligation to indemnify Parent under _Section
7.2(a)_ unless and until the aggregate of all Losses suffered by Parent and
its affiliates hereunder exceeds $400,000 (the "Threshold"), whereupon the
Escrow Stockholders shall be liable to indemnify Parent and its affiliates for
the Indemnifiable Amount of all Losses incurred by Parent and its affiliates,
including the amount of the Threshold.   

(iii) In the event that Parent or its affiliates incur an Indemnifiable Amount
of Losses recoverable pursuant to this _Article VII_ in excess of the Escrow
Amount or after the Escrow Fund has been released, the Escrow Stockholders
shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its affiliates from and against
all such Losses; _provided_ that the aggregate Indemnifiable Amount of Losses
recoverable by Parent (including amounts recovered from the Escrow Fund) shall
be limited to $9,113,516 (the "Cap"). Each Escrow Stockholders aggregate
maximum indemnification obligation shall equal such Escrow Stockholders pro
rata portion of the amount of the Cap, determined based on the proportion
that the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration payable to such Escrow
Stockholder bears to the aggregate total Merger Consideration payable to all
Escrow Stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cap shall not apply
in the case of (A) indemnification under _Sections 7.2(a)(v)_, (B) Losses
arising out of or in connection with a breach of the representations in
_Sections 2.2_, _2.4_ , _2.8_ and _2.19_  and (C) fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or actual concealment.   

(iv) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that following
the Effective Time, no Stockholder who is not an Escrow Stockholder shall
have any have any obligations with respect to or liability for indemnifying
Parent or its affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or as otherwise set forth in the Non-Escrow Stockholder
Release,  _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not be deemed a
waiver by any party of any right or remedy arising by reason of any claim of
fraud.   

(d) _Termination and Distribution of Escrow Fund_. The Escrow Fund shall
terminate on the date that is eighteen months after the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such portion of the Escrow Fund, which in the
reasonable judgment of Parent is necessary to cover any unsatisfied,
anticipated or disputed Losses specified in any Officers Certificate
delivered to the Escrow Agent at or prior to termination of the Escrow Fund
shall remain in the Escrow Fund (and the Escrow Fund shall remain in
existence) until all such claims have been satisfied or resolved. As soon
after the scheduled expiration of the Escrow Fund as all claims for Losses
have been satisfied or resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining
portion of the Escrow Fund to the Escrow Stockholders on whose behalf such
Escrow Funds were deposited in accordance with their respective Proportionate
Interests therein, and the proportion of cash and shares of Parent
Common Stock deposited on behalf of such Escrow Stockholders.   

(e) _Claims_. In order to make a claim for indemnification pursuant to this
_Article VII_ , Parent shall deliver to Escrow Agent (solely with respect to
indemnification for the Indemnifiable Amount of Losses up to the Escrow
Amount and during the Escrow Period), and the Stockholder Agent a certificate
signed by any authorized officer of Parent (an "Officers Certificate"). Such
Officers Certificate shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts
and circumstances giving rise to the claim and the basis for indemnification,
including (i) the amount of Losses paid or incurred by Parent prior to the
date of the Officers Certificate and/or (ii) Parents reasonable good faith
expectation or estimate of its Losses (the "Estimated Losses")  _provided,
however_ , that Parent may revise its actual or Estimated Losses at any time
by providing an updated Officers Certificate giving of the same to the
Stockholder Agent and the Escrow Agent, setting forth the revised actual or
Estimated Losses and the basis for such revision. In addition, Parent may
provide an updated Officers Certificate at the time that the amount
of Estimated Losses specified in an Officers Certificate become actual
Losses. The claims set forth in any Officers Certificate or any such updated
Officers Certificate shall be deemed timely made within the applicable
survival period set forth in _Section 7.1_ if the Officers
Certificate first reporting the applicable actual or Estimated Losses was
timely submitted to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Agent. With respect
to Losses for which the Indemnifiable Amount is less than or equal to Escrow
Amount, immediately upon receipt of such Officers Certificate, the Escrow
Agent shall set aside an amount in the Escrow Fund equal to the aggregate
Indemnifiable Amount of Losses claimed from the Escrow Fund in the Officers
Certificate. The Escrow Agent shall not distribute any amounts to Parent
(other than amounts advanced to Parent for legal costs and expenses
pursuant to the subparagraph _(a)_ above) out of the Escrow Fund for twenty
days after the date of the Officers Certificate, unless the Stockholder
Agent authorizes the Escrow Agent to make such distribution prior to such
date.   

(f) _Objections to Claims_. The Escrow Agent shall distribute to Parent from
the Escrow Fund, or, once the Escrow Fund has been exhausted or released, the
Escrow Stockholders shall pay, the full Indemnifiable Amount of actual Losses
claimed in an Officers Certificate (as it may have been updated) immediately
after the twenty day waiting period specified in subparagraph _(e)_  expires
(or at such earlier date as the Stockholder Agent may authorize in writing),
unless prior to such time the Stockholder Agent delivers a written objection
to the claim made in the Officers Certificate (a "Notice of Dispute") to the
Escrow Agent, if applicable, with a copy to Parent and its counsel. The
Notice of Dispute must include a reasonably detailed description of the basis
of the objection, as well as the amount of Losses, if any, which the
Stockholder Agent is not disputing. The Indemnifiable Amount of any
undisputed actual Losses immediately shall be paid by the Escrow Agent or the
Escrow Stockholders, as applicable. If the Stockholder Agent does not timely
deliver a Notice of Dispute (or such notice of Dispute does not reasonably
describe the basis of the objection), the Stockholder Agent shall be deemed
to have irrevocably approved and consented to the payment of the
Indemnifiable Amount of all actual Losses specified in the Officers
Certificate. The Escrow Agent and Parent shall be entitled to rely on and act
in accordance with any written or deemed (by failure to timely deliver a
Notice of Dispute that reasonably describes the basis of the objection)
approval and consent of the Stockholder Agent in immediately distributing the
Indemnifiable Amount of any actual Losses claimed in a specific Officers
Certificate, even if the Stockholder Agent subsequently objects to or disputes
the nature or amount of Losses. At such time as the amounts in the Escrow
Fund is depleted to cover Indemnifiable Amounts of Losses, all Escrow
Stockholders automatically shall cease to have any claim on any portion of
the Escrow Fund.    

(g) _Resolution of Conflicts_.   

(i) If the Stockholder Agent timely and properly delivers a Notice of Dispute,
the Stockholder Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon
the rights and responsibilities of the respective parties with respect to
such Losses, unless the amount of such Losses relates to third party claims
that are the subject of an ongoing proceeding before a court, arbitrator
or Governmental Entity and remain to be definitively determined (in which
case, Parent shall be entitled to periodically make a claim for the
Indemnifiable Amount of any Losses associated with such proceeding (including
an advance of legal fees and settlement costs), in addition to
seeking recovery for the aggregate Indemnifiable Amount of actual Losses once
determined, _less_ any amounts previously paid during the pendency of the
proceeding). If the Stockholder Agent and Parent should agree as a result of
their good faith efforts as to the appropriate Indemnifiable Amount
and treatment of such Losses, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall
be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow
Agent (to the extent the Losses are to be paid from the Escrow Fund) or to
the Escrow Stockholders (to the extent the Losses are to be paid by
the Escrow Stockholders). The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on and
act in accordance with any such memorandum and promptly shall distribute to
Parent the specified amounts from the Escrow Fund.   

(ii) If no agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either
Parent or the Stockholder Agent may initiate a proceeding in any court of
competent jurisdiction to seek enforcement of its rights or resolution of the
dispute under this _Section 7.2_. The Escrow Agent and Parent shall be
entitled to act in accordance with any resulting court decision and
make payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance with any final judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction.    

(h) _Appointment of Stockholder Agent; Power of Attorney_.   

(i) If the Merger is approved, immediately upon the Effective Time and without
further act of any Stockholder, J. Alex Hartzler shall be appointed as the
agent and attorney-in-fact (such person, and any successor or replacement
thereof as provided below, the "Stockholder Agent") for each Escrow
Stockholder. The Stockholder Agent shall be authorized, for and on behalf of
all Escrow Stockholders, to give and receive notices and communications, to
authorize the distribution to Parent of monies from the Escrow Fund, to
object to such distributions, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements
and compromises of, litigate or arbitrate, comply with orders of courts
and awards of arbitrators with respect to any claims for Losses and to take
all other actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder
Agent to accomplish the foregoing. The Stockholder Agent may be replaced by
the holders of a majority of the Proportionate Interests of the Escrow
Stockholders from time to time upon not less than ten (10) days prior written
notice to Parent certifying that the Stockholder Agent has been removed by
the requisite vote or consent of such holders, specifying the percentage of
all Proportionate Interests so voted or consenting and specifying the
substitute Stockholder Agent appointed by such holders. No bond shall be
required of the Stockholder Agent, and the Stockholder Agent shall not
receive any compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or
from the Stockholder Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Escrow Stockholders.   

(ii) The Stockholder Agent has a duty to act in good faith at all times. The
Escrow Stockholders, by executing and delivering the Written Consents in
connection with the Merger and approving the appointment of the Stockholder
Agent, agree to jointly and severally indemnify the Stockholder Agent and
hold the Stockholder Agent harmless against any Losses incurred by
the Stockholder Agent (including reasonable fees and expenses of any legal
counsel retained by the Stockholder Agent) arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholder Agents duties
hereunder, unless such Losses directly result from the gross
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the Stockholder Agent. Subject
and subordinate in every respect to the prior right of Parent to make claims
for Losses, the Stockholder Agent shall have the right to recover from the
Escrow Fund any fees, costs and expenses reasonably paid or incurred by
the Stockholder Agent in acting as the Stockholder Agent hereunder prior to
any distribution to the holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Stockholder Agent may not recover any such amounts until the eighteen-month
anniversary of the Effective Time and only then to the extent that there are
no claims for Losses asserted by Parent that remain unsatisfied or are
pending resolution.   

(i) _Actions of the Stockholder Agent_. Any decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Agent shall constitute a decision of all
Escrow Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of
the Escrow Stockholders. The Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Agent as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every Escrow Stockholder.
The Escrow Agent, the Company (and the Surviving Corporation after the
Merger) and Parent hereby are relieved from any liability to any person for
any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Agent or for any actions taken by the
Stockholder Agent.   

(j) _Third-Party Claims_. If Parent becomes aware of any third-party claim
which Parent believes may result in a claim for Losses, against the Escrow
Fund or otherwise, Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholder Agent of such
claim, and the Stockholder Agent shall be entitled, at his sole cost and
expense without reimbursement from the Escrow Fund, to participate in
any defense of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such
notice shall not relieve the Escrow Stockholders of their obligations
hereunder, except to the extent they shall have been materially prejudiced by
such failure. Parent shall reasonably consult with the Stockholder Agent
regarding the defense of any such claim and, prior to the settlement of any
such claim, shall reasonably consult with the Stockholder Agent in good faith
regarding the potential settlement. Parent shall not settle any such claim or
consent to entry of any judgment with respect to such third-party claim
except with the consent of the Stockholder Agent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except as provided below. In the event that Parent and
the Stockholder Agent are unable to agree after reasonable consultation,
Parent and the Stockholder Agent shall mutually agree on one mediator not
affiliated with either party to attempt to resolve such disagreement. Parent
and the Stockholder Agent shall cooperate with one another in good faith in
selecting a mediator and in scheduling mediation proceedings and shall act in
good faith in such mediation. In the event that: (i) Parent and the
Stockholder Agent are unable to agree with respect to a settlement or entry
of final judgment after the mediation proceedings described above, (ii)
Parent has reasonably determined that Losses which may be incurred as a result
of the third party claim could exceed the Cap; (iii) the third party claim
seeks an injunction or other equitable relief likely to be materially adverse
to the continuing business interests of Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole; (iv) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to,
the third party claim is, in the good faith judgment of Parent, likely to
establish a precedential custom or practice materially adverse to the
continuing business interests of Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; or (v) the third party claim is made by a person that has
been employed by Parent for which the settlement amount is less than
$100,000, then Parent may settle such claim or consent to entry of any
judgment with respect to such third party claim without the consent of the
Stockholder Agent with its own funds and not out of the Escrow
Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the amount of any
settlement made or entry of judgment consented to by Parent without the
Stockholder Agents consent shall not be determinative of the validity of the
claim against the Escrow Fund or the Escrow Stockholders or the amount of the
Loss (but the facts and evidence underlying Parents decision to settle or
consent to the entry of judgment at such amount can be considered in the
determination of the validity of such claim and the amount of the Loss). If
the Stockholder Agent consents to the general economic terms of
such settlement or entry of judgment or elects not to consult with Parent
with respect to any such settlement, no Escrow Stockholder shall have any
power or authority to object under any provision of this _Article VII_ to
the settlement or the amount of any claim for Losses by Parent against the
Escrow Fund or otherwise with respect to such settlement to the extent the
amount of Losses claimed are consistent with the terms of such
settlement.   

ARTICLE VIII    

TERMINATION, EXPENSES, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER    

8.1 _Termination_. Except as provided in _Section 8.2_ below, this Agreement
may be terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not the Merger has been approved by the Company Stockholders

referred to as the "Termination Date"):    

(a) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent.    

(b) by Parent:   

(i) if any Stockholder shall seek to withdraw any Written Consent or any other
approval of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby requiring stockholder approval;   

(ii) if the Companys Board of Directors shall at any time fail to unanimously
recommend to the Stockholders approval of this Agreement, the Ancillary

stockholder approval;   

(iii) if Parent is not then in material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement and there has been a material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of
Company and the Company has not cured such breach within 15 days following
written notice by Parent (provided that such cure period shall not extend
beyond the Final Date);   

(iv) if there shall be any action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or
order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Merger by
any Governmental Entity, which would: (A) prohibit Parent or the Surviving
Corporations ownership or operation of all or any portion of the business,
assets or properties of the Company or (B) compel Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to dispose of or hold separate all or any portion of the
business, assets or properties of Parent or the Company as a result of or
after the Merger; or   

(v) if at any time any Stockholder shall have indicated an intent to exercise,
have exercised, or shall have any continued rights to exercise, appraisal,
dissenters or similar rights under Applicable Law by virtue of the
Merger.    

(c) by Parent or the Company if:   

(i) the Closing has not occurred by August 15, 2005 (the "Final Date");
_provided_ , that no party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

obligations under this Agreement shall have been the reason that the Closing
shall not have occurred on or before said date   

(ii) there shall be a final nonappealable order of a federal or state court in
effect preventing consummation of the Merger; or   

(iii) there shall be any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted,
promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Merger by any Governmental

obligations under this Agreement and there has been a material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
on the part of the Parent or Merger Sub and the Parent or Merger Sub has not
cured such breach within 15 days following written notice by the
Company (provided that such cure period shall not extend beyond the Final
Date).   

Where action is taken to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1_, it shall be sufficient for such action to be authorized by the Board of
Directors (as applicable) of the party taking such action. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section 8.1_ to the contrary, neither Parent nor the
Company may terminate this Agreement if such party is in material breach of
its obligations hereunder and the Closing does not occur as a direct or
indirect result of such material breach.   

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
this  _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or
Company, or their respective officers, directors or stockholders; _provided_

Agreement prior to its termination; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the provisions of _Sections 5.2_, _5.3_ , _8.2_ , _8.3_ and _Article IX_

and effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be the obligation of the respective
party incurring such fees and expenses.   

8.4 _Amendment_. Except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time after the
stockholders of the Company approve this Agreement pursuant to a written
instrument executed by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and, as to matters
expressly involving the Stockholder Agent, the Stockholder Agent.

Agreement shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each party hereto and delivered to the other parties.   

9.4 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the schedules and exhibits
hereto, and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the
parties hereto referenced herein: (a) constitute the entire agreement among
the parties with respect to the respective subject matters hereof and thereof
and supersede in their entirety any prior or contemporaneous oral or written

6 of the Letter Agreement dated May 17, 2005 executed by the Company and
Parent which shall continue in accordance with the terms thereof); (b) are
not intended to and shall not confer upon any other person (including
those persons listed on any exhibits or schedules attached hereto or any

preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding on and inure to the
benefit of, and is enforceable by, the respective parties hereto and their
respective successors, permitted assigns, heirs, executors and
administrators.   

9.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue
in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other
persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect
the express intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree that any
such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement shall be deemed
replaced with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.   

9.6 _Remedies; Exercise of Rights_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy available to such party
hereunder or at law or in equity, and the exercise by any party of any one
remedy at any time will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy at
the same time, at another time, or in different circumstances. No failure or
delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder

thereof (or failure to exercise) preclude any other, further or
fuller exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to
its conflicts or choice of law principles.

in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the
State of California sitting in Los Angeles County and each party
hereto hereby unconditionally and irrevocably submits and consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any objection which such party may now or hereafter have to the laying
of venue in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding which
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of
any such court. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party
hereto agrees that service of process on such party as provided in _Section
9.1_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such party. In addition
to any damages or other recovery to which a party may be entitled hereunder
or at law or in equity (including any right to recoup Losses from the Escrow
Fund), the prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement or to
seek any right or remedy available hereunder or at law or in equity shall be
entitled to reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred in connection with
such action and any related appeals therefrom.   

9.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree that any failure
of any party to perform its agreements and obligations hereunder or
contemplated hereby will cause irreparable injury to the other parties, for
which damages, even if available, will not provide an adequate remedy.
Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief
by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such partys
obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific
performance of its obligations hereunder.   

9.10 _Rules of Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement. In
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement and the applicable Ancillary Agreements shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions hereof or thereof. Accordingly, each party understands and agrees
that the common law principles of construing ambiguities against the drafter
shall have no application to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Each
party hereto acknowledges and agrees that such party has had a full and
complete opportunity to review this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement,
to make suggestions or changes to their terms and to seek independent legal
and other advice in connection herewith and therewith.
