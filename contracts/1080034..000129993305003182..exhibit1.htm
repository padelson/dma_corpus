<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the &#147;<B>Agreement</B>&#148;) is made and entered into as of June&nbsp;10,
2005 by and among ValueClick, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<B>Parent</B>&#148;), Spider Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<B>Merger Sub</B>&#148;), Web Marketing
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<B>Company</B>&#148;), and J. Alex Hartzler, an individual, solely
in his capacity as Stockholder Agent (as defined in <U>Section&nbsp;7.2(h)</U>).


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>RECITALS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">A.&nbsp;The Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub believe it is
advisable and in the best interests of each company and their respective stockholders that Parent
acquire the Company through the statutory merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the
&#147;<B>Merger</B>&#148;) and, in furtherance thereof, have approved the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">B.&nbsp;Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the &#147;<B>Company Common Stock</B>&#148;) and preferred stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the &#147;<B>Company Preferred Stock</B>&#148; and, together with the
Company Common Stock, the &#147;<B>Company Capital Stock</B>&#148;), shall be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash only or both cash and shares of common stock of Parent, par value $0.001 per share
(&#147;<B>Parent Common Stock</B>&#148;) determined pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;1.6(a)</U>, subject to adjustment
pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;1.6(f)</U> hereof and subject to the provisions of <U>Section&nbsp;1.8</U>
hereof pursuant to which a portion of the Merger Consideration allocable to the holders of Company
Capital Stock pursuant to the Merger will be deposited into the Escrow Fund (as defined in
<U>Section&nbsp;1.8</U>).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">C.&nbsp;Pursuant to the Merger, all outstanding options (&#147;<B>Company Options</B>&#148;) to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock at the Effective Time shall either be terminated at the Effective Time or be
assumed by Parent and shall become exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock from and after the
Effective Time, as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;1.6(b)</U> below. Company Options for the purchase of
454,470 shares of Company Common Stock as of the date hereof with an initial exercise price of
$0.04 per share are deemed to be &#147;<B>In-the-Money Company Options</B>&#148; for purpose of this Agreement. All
other Company Options shall be deemed to be &#147;<B>Out-of-the-Money Company Options</B>&#148; for purposes of the
Agreement, subject to any different result as determined in accordance with the definition of
&#147;Common Stock Amount&#148; herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">D.&nbsp;The Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations and warranties
and other agreements in connection with the Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">E.&nbsp;In recognition of the consideration receivable pursuant to the Agreement and in connection
with the purchase of all their respective shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the Merger,
certain individuals have agreed to enter into a non-competition agreement with Parent substantially
in the form of <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> attached hereto (the &#147;<B>Non-Competition Agreement</B>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">F.&nbsp;As a condition and an inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement, each stockholder
of the Company (each, a &#147;<B>Stockholder</B>&#148; and collectively the &#147;<B>Stockholders</B>&#148;) has executed and
delivered, and each party who hereafter becomes a Stockholder will execute and deliver, irrevocable
written consents in the form of <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U> attached hereto (each, a &#147;<B>Written Consent</B>&#148;),
pursuant to which each such Stockholder has consented or will consent to the adoption and approval
of the Merger and this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties to this Agreement hereby agree as follows:


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>ARTICLE I</B>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>THE MERGER</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">1.1 <U>The Merger</U>. At the Effective Time (as defined in <U>Section&nbsp;1.3</U>) and upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the &#147;<B>DGCL</B>&#148;) (a)&nbsp;Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, (b)&nbsp;the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and (c)&nbsp;the
Company shall continue as the corporation surviving the Merger and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent. The Company as the corporation surviving the Merger is sometimes referred to as the
&#147;<B>Surviving Corporation</B>.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">1.2 <U>Closing</U>. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to <U>Section
8.1</U>, the closing of the Merger (the &#147;<B>Closing</B>&#148;) will take place at the offices of Parent at
30699 Russell Ranch Road, Suite&nbsp;250, Westlake Village, California 91361 as promptly as practicable
following the satisfaction or valid waiver of the conditions set forth in <U>Article&nbsp;VI</U>,
unless another place or time is agreed in writing by Parent and the Company. The date the Closing
actually occurs is referred to as the &#147;<B>Closing Date</B>.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">1.3 <U>Actions at the Closing</U>. At the Closing: (a)&nbsp;Parent and Merger Sub shall deliver
to the Company the various certificates, instruments and documents referenced in <U>Section
6.2</U>, (b)&nbsp;the Company shall deliver to Parent and Merger Sub the various certificates,
instruments and documents referenced in <U>Section&nbsp;6.3</U> and (c)&nbsp;the parties hereto shall
consummate the Merger by filing the Certificate of Merger in the form of <U>Exhibit&nbsp;C</U> attached
hereto (the &#147;<B>Certificate of Merger</B>&#148;) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the time of acceptance of such Certificate of
Merger by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware being referred to herein as the
&#147;<B>Effective Time</B>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">1.4 <U>Effect of the Merger</U>. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as
provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving Corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">1.5 <U>Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Officers and Directors</U>. Unless otherwise
determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall, without further action, be amended
and restated as set forth in Exhibit&nbsp;A to the Certificate of Merger, and shall be the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable law;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;the Bylaws of the Company shall, without further action, be amended and restated to read
the same as the Bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time, and shall be the Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;the officers and directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall become the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation, to serve as such until the death, resignation, removal
or replacement of such persons as provided by law and the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">1.6 <U>Merger Consideration; Effect on Capital Stock</U>. The aggregate maximum
consideration to be paid to the Stockholders by Parent and Merger Sub for all the outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock and rights to acquire Company Capital Stock at the Closing shall be
$140,000,000 in cash and shares of Parent Common Stock minus (i)&nbsp;the amount of any outstanding debt
of the Company and its subsidiaries (the &#147;<B>Debt Amount</B>&#148;) under that certain Revolving Credit, Term
Loan and Security Agreement dated May&nbsp;18, 2004 among the Company, its subsidiaries and
CapitalSource Finance LLC (the &#147;<B>CapitalSource Debt</B>&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;Third Party Expenses of the Company in
the amount set forth on the Third Party Expense Schedule, and (iii)&nbsp;the Option Cancellation Price
(as defined in <U>Section&nbsp;1.6(c)</U>, and subject to further adjustment as provided in <U>Section
1.6(f)</U> (such amount, as adjusted, the &#147;<B>Merger Consideration</B>&#148;), and subject to the deposit of a
portion of the Merger Consideration into the Escrow Fund as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;1.8</U>. Of
the Merger Consideration, a portion shall consist of cash (such amount, as adjusted, the &#147;<B>Cash
Consideration</B>&#148;) and the remainder shall consist of shares of Parent Common Stock (the &#147;<B>Stock
Consideration</B>&#148;), in the amounts and allocated among the Stockholders as set forth in the Final
Schedule&nbsp;1.6(a). For the purposes of determining the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
included in the Stock Consideration, each share of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at $10.22,
the weighted average closing price of one share of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ National
Market over the 5 trading day period ending on the trading day before the date hereof (the &#147;<B>Average
Price</B>&#148;). Attached hereto as Schedule&nbsp;1.6 (a)(1) is an estimate of the Third Party Expenses. On
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Stockholders, the following shall occur:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Company Capital Stock</U>. Each outstanding share of Company Capital Stock
automatically will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash or a combination of
cash and Parent Common Stock, as set forth on Final Schedule&nbsp;1.6(a). In the case of shares of
Company Preferred Stock, the payment set forth on Schedule&nbsp;1.6(a) represents the Preference Amount.
A preliminary calculation of Schedule&nbsp;1.6(a) is attached hereto. Upon confirmation of the amount
of Merger Consideration payable to the Stockholders as of the Closing Date after taking into
consideration all adjustments contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;1.6</U>, including <U>Section
1.6(f)</U> and <U>1.6(g)</U>, Parent and the Company shall prepare and agree upon an updated
Schedule&nbsp;1.6(a) as of the Closing Date, which shall be subject to Parent&#146;s reasonable approval (the
&#147;<B>Final Schedule&nbsp;1.6(a)</B>&#148;). Each Stockholder acknowledged in the Written Consent that each
Stockholder may be receiving a different combination of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock in
the Merger, and each Stockholder thereby acknowledged and agreed to the allocations set forth on
Schedule&nbsp;1.6(a).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Company Options</U>. Each In-the-Money Company Option outstanding at the Effective
Time shall be terminated by the Company as of the Effective Time in exchange for payment by the
Company of such In-the-Money Company Option&#146;s pro rata share of the Option Cancellation Price, as
set forth on Schedule&nbsp;1.6(a). Parent and the Company agree to treat the payment for tax purposes
as not allocable to the portion of the day after the Effective Time. Each Out-of-the-Money Company
Option outstanding at the Effective Time shall be deemed assumed by Parent, and from and after the
Effective Time, (i)&nbsp;each outstanding Out-of-the Money Company Option shall entitle the holder
thereof to acquire the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) determined by multiplying (A)&nbsp;the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Out-of-the Money Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B)&nbsp;the Option Exchange
Ratio and (ii)&nbsp;the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock subject to such assumed
Out-of-the Money Company Options at and after the Effective Time shall be an amount (rounded up to
the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) equal to (A)&nbsp;the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to the Out-of-the Money Company Option prior to the Effective Time divided by (B)&nbsp;the
Option Exchange Ratio. Other than as provided above and except as provided in the relevant Company
Option agreement, each assumed Out-of-the Money Company Option shall be subject to the same vesting
schedule and other terms and conditions for such Company Option as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time. A calculation of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock and revised
exercise price applicable to the Out-of-the-Money Company Options as of the Effective Time shall be
provided on Schedule&nbsp;1.6(b) as of the Closing Date (which Schedule&nbsp;1.6(b) shall be subject to
Parent&#146;s reasonable approval).



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">For purposes hereof:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(A)&nbsp;&#147;<B>Common Stock Amount</B>&#148; means (x)&nbsp;the Merger Consideration minus the Preference Amount
divided by (y)&nbsp;the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time, including the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by the
Conversion Amount of the Company Preferred Stock, as such term is defined in the Company&#146;s
Certificate of Incorporation immediately prior to the Effective Time (such number, the &#147;<B>Common
Participation Amount</B>&#148; and, together with the Company Common Stock, the &#147;<B>Common Equity</B>&#148;).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if upon the delivery of the Final Working Capital Calculation, the
Company Options deemed to be &#147;Out-of-the-Money Company Options&#148; are not out-of-the-money based on
the per share value of the consideration to be received by holders of Common Equity in the Merger,
then the Common Stock Amount will be recalculated such that a number of such Company Options are
included in the Common Equity determined using the treasury stock method;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(B)&nbsp;&#147;<B>Option Exchange Ratio</B>&#148; means the quotient obtained by dividing the Common Stock Amount
plus $7&nbsp;million by the Average Price.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(C)&nbsp;&#147;<B>Preference Amount</B>&#148; means the amount of Merger Consideration payable with respect to the
Liquidation Value of the shares of Company Preferred Stock (as such term is defined in the
Company&#146;s Certificate of Incorporation as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
including accrued but unpaid dividends) outstanding as of the Effective Time (valuing the Stock
Consideration at the Average Price), as specified on Schedule&nbsp;1.6(a).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(D)&nbsp;&#147;<B>Option Cancellation Price</B>&#148; means (prior to reduction for tax withholding) the aggregate
price to be paid, including employer payroll tax, to cause the termination in accordance with the
Initial Pool Plan of all In-the-Money Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company acting in good faith,
subject to Parent&#146;s approval of the price as so determined. A calculation of the Option
Cancellation Price is attached hereto as Schedule&nbsp;1.6(b)(1) (which Schedule&nbsp;1.6(b)(1) shall be
updated as of the Effective Time in accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;1.6</U>, and subject to
Parent&#146;s reasonable approval.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>No Fractional Shares</U>. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued by virtue of the Merger, and no dividend, stock split or other
distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall relate to any such fractional interest, and
any such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
security holder. In lieu thereof, Parent shall pay to the holder of shares of Company Capital
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, as soon as
practicable after the Effective Date (and in the same manner required for delivery of cash and
certificates of Parent Common Stock provided in <U>Section&nbsp;1.9</U>), an amount in cash equal to
such fraction multiplied by the Average Price.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Merger Sub Stock</U>. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding as of the
Effective Time automatically shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective
Time, each stock certificate formerly representing shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall be
deemed to represent an equivalent number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt">(e) <U>Adjustments for Subsequent Changes</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(i)&nbsp;The amount of cash payable with respect to the Company Capital Stock pursuant to
<U>Section&nbsp;1.6</U> shall be equitably and appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split,
reverse split, stock combination, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Capital Stock which occurs after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(ii)&nbsp;If, after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into or exchanged for a different number of
shares or kind of shares and/or other securities of Parent or another corporation or entity by
reason of any reclassification, split-up, stock dividend or stock combination or any arrangement,
amalgamation or similar statutory procedure (an &#147;<B>Adjustment Event</B>&#148;), then the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to be delivered as the Stock Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted so
that each holder of Certificates shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time, in lieu of the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock provided for in this <U>Section&nbsp;1.6</U>, such number and
kind of shares and/or other securities as such holder would have received if the record date and
payment date for such Adjustment Event had been immediately after the Effective Time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;<U>Adjustment to Purchase Price</U>. The amount of Merger Consideration paid to the
Stockholders shall be subject to (i)&nbsp;downward adjustment, on a dollar for dollar basis, to the

adjustment, on a dollar for dollar basis, to the extent that Working Capital is more than
$2,400,000 as of the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;<B>Working Capital</B>&#148; is defined as
(i)&nbsp;total current assets (as defined under United States generally accepted accounting principles
(&#147;<B>GAAP</B>&#148;)) of the Company and its subsidiaries on a combined basis, <I>less </I>(ii)&nbsp;the sum of (A)&nbsp;total

than the CapitalSource Debt and the Option Cancellation Price deducted from the Merger
Consideration as provided in this <U>Section&nbsp;1.6</U> and other than the line item entitled
Dividend Payable on the Working Capital Calculation, which is included in the Preference Amount)
not paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time, (B)&nbsp;all fees, costs and expenses incurred by
the Company, including Third Party Expenses, legal fees, financial advisor fees (including of the
type described in <U>Section&nbsp;2.19</U>), employee bonuses and severance benefits (including related
payroll taxes) incurred in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or resulting from the
Merger not paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time and not deducted from the Merger
Consideration as provided in this <U>Section&nbsp;1.6</U>, (C)&nbsp;all anticipated costs of the Audit (as
defined in <U>Section&nbsp;5.1(a)</U>) not paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time and (D)&nbsp;all
of the fees, costs and expenses associated with preparing and filing any Tax Returns (as defined in
<U>Section&nbsp;2.8</U>) not timely filed prior to the Effective Time, and all unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes
(including, in each case, accountant&#146;s and attorney&#146;s fees and the amount of any required payments
for Pre-Closing Taxes, any penalties and additions to tax, and any interest thereon), but only to
the extent such amounts described in this clause (D)&nbsp;exceed the amount reserved for Pre-Closing
Taxes set forth on the Closing Date Working Capital Calculation and included in the liabilities of
the Company under clause (A)&nbsp;above. For the avoidance of doubt, no particular liability or cost
shall be counted more than once when determining the amount to subtract pursuant to clause (ii)
above. To facilitate and expedite the calculation of any necessary adjustments to the Merger
Consideration, the Company has prepared and delivered on the date hereof a calculation of the
amount of Working Capital as of the date hereof (the &#147;<B>Preliminary Working Capital Calculation</B>&#148;)
certified by the Company&#146;s Chief Financial Officer as true and correct, and, immediately prior to
the Closing, the Company shall provide a similarly certified update of such calculation as of the
Closing Date (the &#147;<B>Closing Date Working Capital Calculation</B>&#148;). To the extent that Working Capital
as reflected in the Closing Date Working Capital Calculation is less than $2,400,000, the Merger
Consideration payable to the Stockholders pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;1.6</U> shall be reduced on a
dollar for dollar basis by such shortfall and the amount of Merger Consideration payable to each
Stockholder upon conversion of such Stockholder&#146;s Company Common Stock as set forth on Schedule
1.6(a) shall be reduced in proportion to the percentage that the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable to such Stockholder on account of such Stockholder&#146;s shares of Company Common Stock
(including the Preferred Participation Amount), as specified on Schedule&nbsp;1.6(a), bears to the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable to all Stockholders on account of all Stockholders&#146; Common
Equity. Conversely, to the extent that Working Capital as reflected in the Closing Date Working
Capital Calculation is more than $2,400,000, the Merger Consideration payable to the Stockholders
pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;1.6</U> shall be increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by such excess and
the amount of Merger Consideration payable to each Stockholder upon conversion of such
Stockholder&#146;s Company Common Stock (including the Preferred Participation Amount) as set forth on
Schedule&nbsp;1.6(a) shall be increased in proportion to the percentage that the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable to such Stockholder on account of such Stockholder&#146;s shares of Company Common
Stock, as specified on Schedule&nbsp;1.6(a), bears to the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to all
Stockholders on account of all Stockholder&#146;s Common Equity.

definition of Common Stock Amount: (i)&nbsp;prior to the time any payment of Merger Consideration or
Option Cancellation Price is made to any Stockholder or holder of Company Options, then the amounts
payable to each Stockholder upon conversion of such Stockholder&#146;s Company Capital Stock as set
forth on Schedule&nbsp;1.6(a), the amount of the Option Cancellation Price payable to holders of
In-the-Money Company Options and the Option Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted by Parent to account

Stock Options (in proportion to the Proportionate Interests) so that (x)&nbsp;the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Equity does not exceed the
amount of $140,000,000, less the Debt Amount, the Option Cancellation Price and the Third Party
Expenses listed on the Third Party Expense Schedule and taking into account any adjustment made
pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;1.6(f</U>), preserving to the extent possible the proportions of cash and
shares of Parent Common Stock payable to each such Stockholder and (y)&nbsp;the amount payable on

Stockholder Agent hereunder or pursuant hereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">For purposes of this <U>Article&nbsp;VII</U> &#147;<B>Losses</B>&#148; also shall include a reasonable amount of legal
fees and costs to be advanced to Parent in connection with demonstrating, collecting or defending
against actions or claims based on any of the items specified in clauses <U>(i)</U> through

Parent reasonably in advance of Parent actually incurring such Losses; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that Parent shall promptly refund to the Escrow Fund any amounts so advanced to
the extent that the claim is subsequently determined not to be an indemnifiable claim hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, &#147;Losses&#148; shall not include any amounts for which
Parent or its affiliates are actually reimbursed under any insurance policy of the Company and its
subsidiaries for which the premium was fully paid by the Company prior to the Closing Date. For
purposes of indemnification obligations hereunder and the calculation of Losses pursuant to
<U>Article&nbsp;VII</U>, any inaccuracy in or breach of a representation of warranty shall be deemed to
constitute a breach of such representation or warranty, notwithstanding any limitation or
qualification as to materiality set forth in such representation or warranty as to the scope,

Stockholder, Parent will deposit the Escrow Amount into an escrow account with Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. (the &#147;<B>Escrow Agent</B>&#148;), such deposit to establish and constitute the Escrow Fund. The Escrow
Fund shall be governed by the terms set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;7.2</U> and an escrow agreement
substantially in the form attached hereto as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;K</U> (the &#147;<B>Escrow Agreement</B>&#148;). Parent
shall pay one-half of the costs and expenses related to the establishment and maintenance of the
Escrow Fund and the Escrow Stockholders shall pay one-half of such costs and expenses. The cash
portion of the Escrow Amount shall be deposited into an interest bearing account and any interest
earned thereon shall be added to the Escrow Fund and available to cover Losses of Parent and its
affiliates hereunder. Any distributions on the shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow
Fund other than regular cash dividends shall be held by the Escrow Agent and shall be deemed
attached to the shares of Parent Common Stock to which they pertain. For applicable income tax
purposes, any dividends, interest or other income earned on the Escrow Fund shall be treated as
income of the Escrow Stockholder on whose behalf such securities or assets giving rise to such
interest or other income, as the case may be, are being held. The Escrow Stockholders shall not
have the right to sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any cash or
securities held in the Escrow Fund or any interest therein for so long as they are held in the
Escrow Fund. Each Escrow Stockholder shall be entitled to vote the shares of Parent Common Stock
held in the Escrow Fund for so long as they are held by the Escrow Agent, pro rata based on the
value of the shares of Parent Common Stock deposited in the Escrow Fund on behalf of such Escrow
Stockholder. For purposes of determining the value of any shares of Parent Common Stock included
in the Escrow Fund, each such share shall be deemed to have a value equal to the Average Price.
Any amounts distributed to Parent from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Article&nbsp;VII shall be taken
pro rata from the value of the amount in the Escrow Fund on account of each Escrow Stockholder
(valuing any shares of Parent Common Stock at the Average Price), first from the cash included in
the Escrow Fund on account of such Escrow Stockholder and second from any shares of Parent Common
Stock held in the Escrow Fund on account of such Escrow Stockholder.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(i)&nbsp;Subject to the provisions of this Article&nbsp;VII, Parent, on behalf of itself and its
affiliates, shall be entitled to withdraw amounts from the Escrow Amount to compensate Parent and
its affiliates for 31% of any Losses which Parent or any of its affiliates suffers as provided
above (such 31% amount of any Loss, the &#147;<B>Indemnifiable Amount</B>&#148; of such Loss). The decision to
withdraw amounts from the Escrow Fund is at Parent&#146;s discretion, and Parent may determine to seek
recovery for the Indemnifiable Amount of any Losses, in whole or in part, at any time, subject to
the provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;VII</U>. Notwithstanding this <U>Article&nbsp;VII</U> or anything
to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or waive the liability of the Company
for any Losses or damages incurred or sustained by Parent if the Merger does not close. Following
the Effective Time, the sole and exclusive remedy for any Losses incurred by Parent or its
affiliates incurred as a result of any breach by the Company of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement shall be indemnification pursuant to this Article
VII, <I>provided, however</I>, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of any right
or remedy arising by reason of any claim of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or actual
concealment. Parent may not receive any amounts from the Escrow Fund unless and until Parent
delivers an Officer&#146;s Certificate (as defined in subparagraph <U>(e)</U> below) to the Escrow
Agent as described in subparagraph <U>(e)</U> below.

Losses suffered by Parent and its affiliates hereunder exceeds $400,000 (the &#147;<B>Threshold</B>&#148;),
whereupon the Escrow Stockholders shall be liable to indemnify Parent and its affiliates for the
Indemnifiable Amount of all Losses incurred by Parent and its affiliates, including the amount of
the Threshold.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(iii)&nbsp;In the event that Parent or its affiliates incur an Indemnifiable Amount of Losses
recoverable pursuant to this <U>Article&nbsp;VII</U> in excess of the Escrow Amount or after the Escrow
Fund has been released, the Escrow Stockholders shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its
affiliates from and against all such Losses; <U>provided</U> that the aggregate Indemnifiable
Amount of Losses recoverable by Parent (including amounts recovered from the Escrow Fund) shall be
limited to $9,113,516 (the &#147;<B>Cap</B>&#148;). Each Escrow Stockholder&#146;s aggregate maximum indemnification
obligation shall equal such Escrow Stockholder&#146;s pro rata portion of the amount of the Cap,
determined based on the proportion that the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration payable to
such Escrow Stockholder bears to the aggregate total Merger Consideration payable to all Escrow
Stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cap shall not apply in the case of (A)
indemnification under <U>Sections&nbsp;7.2(a)(v)</U>, (B)&nbsp;Losses arising out of or in connection with a
breach of the representations in <U>Sections&nbsp;2.2</U>, <U>2.4</U>, <U>2.8</U> and <U>2.19</U>
and (C)&nbsp;fraud, intentional misrepresentation or actual concealment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(iv)&nbsp;Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that following the Effective
Time, no Stockholder who is not an Escrow Stockholder shall have any have any obligations with
respect to or liability for indemnifying Parent or its affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or as otherwise set forth in the Non-Escrow Stockholder Release,
<I>provided, however</I>, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of any right or
remedy arising by reason of any claim of fraud.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Termination and Distribution of Escrow Fund</U>. The Escrow Fund shall terminate on
the date that is eighteen months after the Effective Time; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that
such portion of the Escrow Fund, which in the reasonable judgment of Parent is necessary to cover
any unsatisfied, anticipated or disputed Losses specified in any Officer&#146;s Certificate delivered to
the Escrow Agent at or prior to termination of the Escrow Fund shall remain in the Escrow Fund (and
the Escrow Fund shall remain in existence) until all such claims have been satisfied or resolved.
As soon after the scheduled expiration of the Escrow Fund as all claims for Losses have been
satisfied or resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund to
the Escrow Stockholders on whose behalf such Escrow Funds were deposited in accordance with their
respective Proportionate Interests therein, and the proportion of cash and shares of Parent Common
Stock deposited on behalf of such Escrow Stockholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;<U>Claims</U>. In order to make a claim for indemnification pursuant to this <U>Article
VII</U>, Parent shall deliver to Escrow Agent (solely with respect to indemnification for the
Indemnifiable Amount of Losses up to the Escrow Amount and during the Escrow Period), and the
Stockholder Agent a certificate signed by any authorized officer of Parent (an &#147;<B>Officer&#146;s
Certificate</B>&#148;). Such Officer&#146;s Certificate shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances giving rise to the claim and the basis for indemnification, including (i)&nbsp;the amount
of Losses paid or incurred by Parent prior to the date of the Officer&#146;s Certificate and/or (ii)
Parent&#146;s reasonable good faith expectation or estimate of its Losses (the &#147;<B>Estimated Losses</B>&#148;)
<U>provided, however</U>, that Parent may revise its actual or Estimated Losses at any time by
providing an updated Officer&#146;s Certificate giving of the same to the Stockholder Agent and the
Escrow Agent, setting forth the revised actual or Estimated Losses and the basis for such revision.
In addition, Parent may provide an updated Officer&#146;s Certificate at the time that the amount of
Estimated Losses specified in an Officer&#146;s Certificate become actual Losses. The claims set forth
in any Officer&#146;s Certificate or any such updated Officer&#146;s Certificate shall be deemed timely made
within the applicable survival period set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;7.1</U> if the Officer&#146;s Certificate
first reporting the applicable actual or Estimated Losses was timely submitted to the Escrow Agent
and the Stockholder Agent. With respect to Losses for which the Indemnifiable Amount is less than
or equal to Escrow Amount, immediately upon receipt of such Officer&#146;s Certificate, the Escrow Agent
shall set aside an amount in the Escrow Fund equal to the aggregate Indemnifiable Amount of Losses
claimed from the Escrow Fund in the Officer&#146;s Certificate. The Escrow Agent shall not distribute
any amounts to Parent (other than amounts advanced to Parent for legal costs and expenses pursuant
to the subparagraph <U>(a)</U> above) out of the Escrow Fund for twenty days after the date of the
Officer&#146;s Certificate, unless the Stockholder Agent authorizes the Escrow Agent to make such
distribution prior to such date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;<U>Objections to Claims</U>. The Escrow Agent shall distribute to Parent from the Escrow
Fund, or, once the Escrow Fund has been exhausted or released, the Escrow Stockholders shall pay,
the full Indemnifiable Amount of actual Losses claimed in an Officer&#146;s Certificate (as it may have
been updated) immediately after the twenty day waiting period specified in subparagraph <U>(e)</U>
expires (or at such earlier date as the Stockholder Agent may authorize in writing), unless prior
to such time the Stockholder Agent delivers a written objection to the claim made in the Officer&#146;s
Certificate (a &#147;<B>Notice of Dispute</B>&#148;) to the Escrow Agent, if applicable, with a copy to Parent and
its counsel. The Notice of Dispute must include a reasonably detailed description of the basis of
the objection, as well as the amount of Losses, if any, which the Stockholder Agent is not
disputing. The Indemnifiable Amount of any undisputed actual Losses immediately shall be paid by
the Escrow Agent or the Escrow Stockholders, as applicable. If the Stockholder Agent does not
timely deliver a Notice of Dispute (or such notice of Dispute does not reasonably describe the
basis of the objection), the Stockholder Agent shall be deemed to have irrevocably approved and
consented to the payment of the Indemnifiable Amount of all actual Losses specified in the
Officer&#146;s Certificate. The Escrow Agent and Parent shall be entitled to rely on and act in
accordance with any written or deemed (by failure to timely deliver a Notice of Dispute that
reasonably describes the basis of the objection) approval and consent of the Stockholder Agent in
immediately distributing the Indemnifiable Amount of any actual Losses claimed in a specific
Officer&#146;s Certificate, even if the Stockholder Agent subsequently objects to or disputes the nature
or amount of Losses. At such time as the amounts in the Escrow Fund is depleted to cover
Indemnifiable Amounts of Losses, all Escrow Stockholders automatically shall cease to have any
claim on any portion of the Escrow Fund.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt">(g) <U>Resolution of Conflicts</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(i)&nbsp;If the Stockholder Agent timely and properly delivers a Notice of Dispute, the Stockholder
Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights and responsibilities of the
respective parties with respect to such Losses, unless the amount of such Losses relates to third
party claims that are the subject of an ongoing proceeding before a court, arbitrator or
Governmental Entity and remain to be definitively determined (in which case, Parent shall be
entitled to periodically make a claim for the Indemnifiable Amount of any Losses associated with
such proceeding (including an advance of legal fees and settlement costs), in addition to seeking
recovery for the aggregate Indemnifiable Amount of actual Losses once determined, <I>less </I>any amounts
previously paid during the pendency of the proceeding). If the Stockholder Agent and Parent should
agree as a result of their good faith efforts as to the appropriate Indemnifiable Amount and
treatment of such Losses, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by
both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent (to the extent the Losses are to be paid
from the Escrow Fund) or to the Escrow Stockholders (to the extent the Losses are to be paid by the
Escrow Stockholders). The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on and act in accordance with any
such memorandum and promptly shall distribute to Parent the specified amounts from the Escrow Fund.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(ii)&nbsp;If no agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either Parent or the
Stockholder Agent may initiate a proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction to seek
enforcement of its rights or resolution of the dispute under this <U>Section&nbsp;7.2</U>. The Escrow
Agent and Parent shall be entitled to act in accordance with any resulting court decision and make
payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance with any final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt">(h) <U>Appointment of Stockholder Agent; Power of Attorney</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(i)&nbsp;If the Merger is approved, immediately upon the Effective Time and without further act of
any Stockholder, J. Alex Hartzler shall be appointed as the agent and attorney-in-fact (such
person, and any successor or replacement thereof as provided below, the &#147;<B>Stockholder Agent</B>&#148;) for
each Escrow Stockholder. The Stockholder Agent shall be authorized, for and on behalf of all
Escrow Stockholders, to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize the distribution
to Parent of monies from the Escrow Fund, to object to such distributions, to agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, litigate or arbitrate, comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to any claims for Losses and to take all other actions necessary
or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Agent to accomplish the foregoing. The
Stockholder Agent may be replaced by the holders of a majority of the Proportionate Interests of
the Escrow Stockholders from time to time upon not less than ten (10)&nbsp;days prior written notice to
Parent certifying that the Stockholder Agent has been removed by the requisite vote or consent of
such holders, specifying the percentage of all Proportionate Interests so voted or consenting and
specifying the substitute Stockholder Agent appointed by such holders. No bond shall be required
of the Stockholder Agent, and the Stockholder Agent shall not receive any compensation for his
services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Agent shall constitute notice to or
from each of the Escrow Stockholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(ii)&nbsp;The Stockholder Agent has a duty to act in good faith at all times. The Escrow
Stockholders, by executing and delivering the Written Consents in connection with the Merger and
approving the appointment of the Stockholder Agent, agree to jointly and severally indemnify the
Stockholder Agent and hold the Stockholder Agent harmless against any Losses incurred by the
Stockholder Agent (including reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the
Stockholder Agent) arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Stockholder Agent&#146;s duties hereunder, unless such Losses directly result from the gross negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith of the Stockholder Agent. Subject and subordinate in every respect
to the prior right of Parent to make claims for Losses, the Stockholder Agent shall have the right
to recover from the Escrow Fund any fees, costs and expenses reasonably paid or incurred by the
Stockholder Agent in acting as the Stockholder Agent hereunder prior to any distribution to the
holders; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Stockholder Agent may not recover any such
amounts until the eighteen-month anniversary of the Effective Time and only then to the extent that
there are no claims for Losses asserted by Parent that remain unsatisfied or are pending
resolution.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(i)&nbsp;<U>Actions of the Stockholder Agent</U>. Any decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Stockholder Agent shall constitute a decision of all Escrow Stockholders and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each of the Escrow Stockholders. The Escrow Agent and Parent may rely
upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Agent as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of each and every Escrow Stockholder. The Escrow Agent, the Company (and
the Surviving Corporation after the Merger) and Parent hereby are relieved from any liability to
any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Stockholder Agent or for any actions taken by the Stockholder Agent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(j)&nbsp;<U>Third-Party Claims</U>. If Parent becomes aware of any third-party claim which Parent
believes may result in a claim for Losses, against the Escrow Fund or otherwise, Parent shall
promptly notify the Stockholder Agent of such claim, and the Stockholder Agent shall be entitled,
at his sole cost and expense without reimbursement from the Escrow Fund, to participate in any
defense of such claim; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that failure to give such notice shall
not relieve the Escrow Stockholders of their obligations hereunder, except to the extent they shall
have been materially prejudiced by such failure. Parent shall reasonably consult with the
Stockholder Agent regarding the defense of any such claim and, prior to the settlement of any such
claim, shall reasonably consult with the Stockholder Agent in good faith regarding the potential
settlement. Parent shall not settle any such claim or consent to entry of any judgment with
respect to such third-party claim except with the consent of the Stockholder Agent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, except as provided below. In the event that Parent and the
Stockholder Agent are unable to agree after reasonable consultation, Parent and the Stockholder
Agent shall mutually agree on one mediator not affiliated with either party to attempt to resolve
such disagreement. Parent and the Stockholder Agent shall cooperate with one another in good faith
in selecting a mediator and in scheduling mediation proceedings and shall act in good faith in such
mediation. In the event that: (i)&nbsp;Parent and the Stockholder Agent are unable to agree with
respect to a settlement or entry of final judgment after the mediation proceedings described above,
(ii)&nbsp;Parent has reasonably determined that Losses which may be incurred as a result of the third
party claim could exceed the Cap; (iii)&nbsp;the third party claim seeks an injunction or other
equitable relief likely to be materially adverse to the continuing business interests of Parent and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iv)&nbsp;settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the
third party claim is, in the good faith judgment of Parent, likely to establish a precedential
custom or practice materially adverse to the continuing business interests of Parent and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (v)&nbsp;the third party claim is made by a person that has been
employed by Parent for which the settlement amount is less than $100,000, then Parent may settle
such claim or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to such third party claim without the
consent of the Stockholder Agent with its own funds and not out of the Escrow Amount.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the amount of any settlement made or entry of
judgment consented to by Parent without the Stockholder Agent&#146;s consent shall not be determinative
of the validity of the claim against the Escrow Fund or the Escrow Stockholders or the amount of
the Loss (but the facts and evidence underlying Parent&#146;s decision to settle or consent to the entry
of judgment at such amount can be considered in the determination of the validity of such claim and
the amount of the Loss). If the Stockholder Agent consents to the general economic terms of such
settlement or entry of judgment or elects not to consult with Parent with respect to any such
settlement, no Escrow Stockholder shall have any power or authority to object under any provision
of this <U>Article&nbsp;VII</U> to the settlement or the amount of any claim for Losses by Parent
against the Escrow Fund or otherwise with respect to such settlement to the extent the amount of
Losses claimed are consistent with the terms of such settlement.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.5 <U>Severability</U>. If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof
becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable,
the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
express intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree that any such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement shall be deemed replaced with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such void or unenforceable provision.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.6 <U>Remedies; Exercise of Rights</U>. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive
of any other remedy available to such party hereunder or at law or in equity, and the exercise by
any party of any one remedy at any time will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy at the
same time, at another time, or in different circumstances. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof (or failure to exercise) preclude any other, further or fuller
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.7 <U>Governing Law</U>. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflicts or choice of law
principles.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.8 <U>Jurisdiction and Venue; Attorney&#146;s Fees</U>. Any action, suit or proceeding seeking
to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively in the federal or
state courts located in the State of California sitting in Los Angeles County and each party hereto
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably submits and consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection which such party may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue in any such court or
that any such suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees that service of process on such
party as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;9.1</U> shall be deemed effective service of process on such
party. In addition to any damages or other recovery to which a party may be entitled hereunder or
at law or in equity (including any right to recoup Losses from the Escrow Fund), the prevailing
party in any action to enforce this Agreement or to seek any right or remedy available hereunder or
at law or in equity shall be entitled to reasonable attorney&#146;s fees and costs incurred in
connection with such action and any related appeals therefrom.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.9 <U><B>Specific Performance</B></U><B>. The parties acknowledge and agree that any failure of any
party to perform its agreements and obligations hereunder or contemplated hereby will cause
irreparable injury to the other parties, for which damages, even if available, will not provide an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by
any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such party&#146;s obligations and to the
granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder.</B>

and drafting of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question
of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement and the applicable Ancillary Agreements shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise

Accordingly, each party understands and agrees that the common law principles of construing
ambiguities against the drafter shall have no application to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that such party has had a full and complete
opportunity to review this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement, to make suggestions or changes
to their terms and to seek independent legal and other advice in connection herewith and therewith.
