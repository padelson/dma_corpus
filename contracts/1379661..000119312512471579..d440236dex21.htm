members shall amend, repeal or otherwise modify the Governing Documents of a
Company or manage a Company in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of persons who at and any time prior to the Closing Date
were managers or officers of such Company or which would affect any
elimination from liability of any such persons. Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that the indemnification provisions in favor of the manager in the Governing
Documents of the Companies may be amended to include officers of the Companies
within the scope of such indemnification. In the event any claim or claims are
asserted or made pursuant to the indemnification rights set forth in
this Section 7.9 prior to the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date,
all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall

Section 7.10. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Execution Date through ten (10) Business Days before
the Closing Date, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer may offer employment,
conditioned on the Closing, to any or all Employees referenced on Section
7.10(a) of the Disclosure

 



33  Schedule (the "Designated Employees") to be effective as of 12:01 a.m. on
the Closing Date (or with respect to a Designated Employee who is on a leave
of absence, effective as of 12:01 am on such later date as such Designated
Employee is released to return to work or is entitled to be restored to
employment) (the "Hire Date"). Each offer of employment shall be on such terms
and conditions of employment that would apply to similarly situated employees
of Buyer; provided, however, that each such offer shall provide an initial
annual salary or hourly wage rate that is not less than the annual salary or
hourly wage rate for such Designated Employee immediately before the Closing
Date and employee benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to
the employee benefits offered to similarly situated employees of Buyer. No
later than five (5) Business Days before the Closing Date, Buyer shall notify
Seller of the identities of the Designated Employees, if any, to whom Buyer or
an Affiliate of Buyer made such an offer of employment and who accepted such
offer and the Designated Employees, if any, to whom Buyer or an Affiliate did
not make such an offer of employment. The Designated Employees, if any, who
have accepted such an offer of employment and begin employment with Buyer or
an Affiliate are referred to as the "Hired Employees". Except as specifically
provided for in this Section, nothing in this Agreement obligates Buyer to
continue the employment of any Hired Employee for any period of time or
otherwise affects BuyerÂ’s right to set or modify the terms and conditions
of employment of such Hired Employees.

(b) From and after the Closing, the Hired Employees will be covered
under such employee compensation and benefit plans, policies, programs or
arrangements as Buyer or an Affiliate may make available to them in accordance
with subsection (a) of this Section, provided that such plans shall include
medical, dental and vision coverage, health care flexible spending account
and a tax-qualified defined contribution plan with a 401(k) feature. Buyer
shall, to the extent permitted under Applicable Law, provide, or cause its
Affiliates to provide, all Hired Employees with prior service credit for all
periods of service with Seller and its Affiliates for all purposes of BuyerÂ’s
and its AffiliatesÂ’ employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements,
including without limitation for purposes of eligibility, participation,
vesting and levels of benefit accruals; provided, however, that with respect
to calendar year 2012, Seller shall pay for vacation, sick and other paid
leave accrued by the Hired Employees with SBO and its Affiliates as of the
Closing Date. Buyer shall, to the extent allowed under Applicable Law, cause,
or cause its Affiliates to cause, any pre-existing condition limitations or
eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations under any Buyer
or its affiliateÂ’s plan providing healthcare benefits to be waived with
respect to the Hired Employees and their eligible dependents.

(c) Seller currently maintains one or more defined contribution plans (the
"Seller DC Plan") which provide certain retirement benefits for the Hired
Employees. Effective as of the Closing Date, with respect to the Hired
Employees, Seller shall take all necessary and appropriate action to amend the
Seller DC Plan in which such employees participate to provide that such
employees receive full and immediate vesting in any employer-derived benefits
accrued under such plan. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing
Date, with respect to each Hired Employee who is a participant in the Seller
DC Plan, Seller shall (i) provide each such employee with the 

 



34  right to receive a distribution of such Hired EmployeeÂ’s vested interest
under such plan and an election to roll over such vested interest in the
Seller DC Plan to a tax-qualified defined contribution plan maintained by
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer (the "Buyer DC Plan"), and (ii) cause the
trustee of the plan to roll over the vested interest which the Hired Employee
elects to roll over to the Buyer DC Plan. Buyer shall cause the Buyer DC Plan
to accept any such rollovers.

(d) Buyer shall be solely responsible, and shall indemnify Seller and its
directors, officers and Affiliates for any costs, losses or liabilities
incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliate(s) to the extent arising out of
BuyerÂ’s determination of which Designated Employees to make offers to or the
actions or omissions of Buyer or its Affiliates from and after the Closing
Date with respect to the Hired Employees.

 

Section 7.11. Taxes .

(a) Buyer and Seller agree to treat the purchase and sale of the Interests for
federal income Tax purposes as a purchase and sale of all of the assets of the
Companies, other than the Excluded Properties. 

(b) Seller shall (i) pay and indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Companies) with respect to, all Taxes of the Companies due, which are
attributable to, or which relate to the Properties and operations of the
Companies during the Pre-Effective Date Tax Period, including the Pre-
Effective Date Straddle Period, except for Taxes taken into account as a
reduction to the Base Purchase Price under Section 12.1 or as a liability in
determining Final Net Working Capital under Article XII, and (ii) indemnify
Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Companies) from and against any
breach of the representations contained in Section 4.11 of this Agreement,
except for Taxes taken into account as a reduction to the Base Purchase Price
under Section 12.1 or as a liability in determining Final Net Working Capital
under Article XII.

(c) Seller shall have no liability for, and Buyer shall be solely liable for
and shall pay, all Taxes of the Companies due for any taxable year or taxable
period beginning after the Effective Date, and all Taxes attributable to a
Post-Effective Date Straddle Period (as defined below).

 

(d) Subject to Article XII, in the case of Taxes that are payable with respect
to any Straddle Period of the Company, for purposes of allocating such Taxes
between that portion of the Straddle Period ending on or before the Effective
Date (the "Pre-Effective Date Straddle Period") and that portion of the
Straddle Period beginning after the Effective Date (the "Post-Effective Date
Straddle Period"), the portion of such Taxes related to the Pre-Effective Date
Straddle Period will be deemed to be:

 

(i) in the case of income Taxes, franchise and margin Taxes, Taxes measured in
whole or in part by reference to gross revenues or receipts, excise,
employment, gross receipts and other similar Taxes, sales and use Taxes and
Taxes imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of
property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), equal to the amount that
would be

 



35  payable if the taxable year of the Company terminated based on an interim
closing of the books as of the Effective Date, and based on accounting
methods, elections and conventions that do not have the effect of distorting
income and expenses; provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on and including the
Effective Date and the period beginning after the Effective Date in proportion
to the number of days in each period; and

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of the Companies, equal to the amount of such Taxes for
the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during
the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Effective Date Straddle Period and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period.

All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations will
be made in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Companies with
respect to such items, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

 

(e) Promptly following the Execution Date, Seller and Buyer shall jointly
engage Duff and Phelps to conduct an appraisal and determine the fair market
value of the Properties. Seller and Buyer each shall be entitled to
participate in the appraisal process and consult with the appraiser. Such
appraisal will be completed no later than fifteen (15) days following the
Closing Date. The cost of such appraisal shall be divided equally between
Seller and Buyer. After the completion of the appraisal, Seller shall prepare
an allocation of the Purchase Price and any other items constituting
consideration among the Properties in a manner that is consistent with the
appraisal and that complies with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Allocation"). Seller shall provide
such Allocation to Buyer for BuyerÂ’s review and comment prior to finalizing
the Allocation. Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
update the Allocation in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code
following any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement.
Seller and Buyer shall timely file all tax returns, including IRS Form 8594,
with the IRS and neither Seller nor Buyer shall take any position in any
return that is inconsistent with the Allocation, as adjusted, unless
otherwise required to do so by Applicable Law or a final determination as
defined in Section 1313 of the Code. Each of Seller and Buyer agree to
promptly advise each other regarding the existence of any Tax audit,
controversy or litigation related to the Allocation. The Parties recognize
that the purchase price allocation may differ for book and tax purposes, and
that for book purposes, the purchase price allocation will be based on GAAP
requirements.

 

(f) Seller and Buyer agree to furnish to each other, at the requesting partyÂ’s
expense, any and all information and documents reasonably required to comply
with Tax and financial reporting requirements and audits.

 



36 (g) The obligations of Seller in this Section 7.11 shall survive the Closing
for a period of thirty (30) days following the applicable statute of
limitations.

(h) Any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.11 shall be made
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 13.4.

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Seller be required to
indemnify Buyer under this Section 7.11 with respect to any ad valorem or
similar real property Taxes attributable to the period between the Purchase
Price Adjustment Date and the Effective Date, and such Taxes shall be the sole
responsibility of Buyer.

Section 7.12. _Press Releases_. Unless consultation is prohibited by
Applicable Law, Buyer and Seller shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation (but no approval thereof shall be required). 

Section 7.13. _Books and Records_. At or promptly after Closing, (i) Seller
shall deliver to Buyer all records relating to the Business and the
Properties that are in SellerÂ’s or its AffiliateÂ’s control, including original
minute books and other corporate books and records and accounts and (ii)
Seller will deliver to Buyer all of the rights of way easements, rights of
way option agreements, files, assignments, operating records and agreements,
engineering records, financial and accounting records, and other similar files
and records of the Companies which directly relate to the Properties. Buyer
agrees that Seller may, subject to the confidentiality obligations in Section
7.7, retain copies of all files transferred to Buyer pursuant to this Section
7.13.

 

Section 7.14. _Rights to "Saddle Butte" Name, Derivations of Name and Logo_.
Buyer agrees that Seller shall retain all rights to the "Saddle Butte" name,
logo, and all derivatives thereof. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall remove all names and markers used by Seller or the Companies
and all variations and derivations thereof and logos relating thereto from
the Properties.

Section 7.15. _Amendments to the Certificates of Formation of the Companies_.
Immediately after the Closing, Buyer agrees to file an amendment to each
CompanyÂ’s certificate of formation in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller
that provides for a change in the name of such Company, which name does not
contain the words "Saddle Butte" or any derivative thereof and is otherwise
reasonably acceptable to Seller.

Section 7.16. _HSR Filing_. If compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), is required in
connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, as
promptly as practicable and in any event not later than ten (10) Business Days
following the Execution Date, Seller and Buyer will file with the Federal
Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, as applicable, the required
notification and report forms and will as promptly as practicable furnish any
supplemental information which may be requested in connection therewith.
Seller and Buyer will request expedited treatment ( _i.e._ , early
termination) of such filing. Buyer and Seller shall use commercially
Reasonable Efforts to make or modify all other filings and submissions on a
prompt and timely basis in connection with the filings required by this
Section. Each of Seller and Buyer will bear its own costs and expenses
relating to the compliance with this Section.

 



37 Section 7.17. _Seller Contracts_. The contracts, permits, easements
and rights-of-way described on Section 7.17(a) and Section 7.17(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule are held by Seller and are used for ownership, operations,
maintenance, repair or replacement of the Pipeline and the
Facilities (collectively, the "Seller Contracts"). Seller agrees to (a)
assign the Seller Contracts to Assets LLC or Berthold Gathering, as
applicable, on or before the Closing and (b) use Reasonable Efforts prior to
Closing and for a period of not less than one year following the Closing to
obtain any consents required therewith. Upon such assignment, the Seller
Contracts shall be deemed to be Properties for the purposes of this Agreement.
If such Seller Contracts are not assigned to the Companies at Closing, then
Seller will cause the Seller Companies to enter into arrangements pursuant to
which the benefits of such Seller Contracts are provided by the Seller
Companies to the Companies, without cost to Buyer or the Companies;
_provided, however,_ that this covenant will survive the Closing and the
benefits pursuant to the Seller Contracts listed on Section 7.17(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule will be provided by the Seller Companies to the Companies
for a period of one (1) year after the Closing Date or such longer period as
Seller may agree to.

 

Section 7.18. _High Prairie_. After the Closing, Seller shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to interconnect with the Pipeline and receive crude
oil at up to three locations to be designated by Seller. Should Seller desire
to exercise its rights under this Section 7.18, Buyer and Seller shall use
good faith efforts to enter into agreements on customary market terms,
consistent with industry practice and standards setting forth the terms and
conditions of such interconnection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
agreements shall contain terms no less favorable to Seller than
those contained in other interconnection agreements with respect to the
Pipeline granted to third parties and to which Buyer is a party. In addition
to the foregoing, Buyer shall have the rights set forth in the High Prairie
Term Sheet attached hereto as Exhibit 7.18.

Section 7.19. _Litigation and Regulatory Cooperation_. For a period of
nine (9) months following the Closing Date, at the BuyerÂ’s sole cost and
expense:

(a) Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in the investigation, defense or
prosecution of any Proceedings now in existence or which may arise in the
future against or on behalf of the Companies which relate to events or
occurrences that transpired or commenced prior to Closing. SellerÂ’s
cooperation in connection with such Proceedings shall include, but not be
limited to, being available at mutually convenient times and with reasonable
advance notice to meet with counsel to prepare for discovery or trial and to
act as a witness on behalf of the Company.

(b) Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in any investigation, defense,
prosecution or remedial action respecting compliance by the Companies and the
Business with regulatory requirements promulgated by applicable Governmental
Entities to the extent such investigation, defense, prosecution or remedial
action relates to events or circumstances that transpired or commenced prior
to Closing.

 



38 Section 7.20. _Title Policies_. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer
in obtaining, prior to Closing, an ownerÂ’s title insurance policy or
leasehold title insurance policy issued by a title company acceptable to
Buyer, with respect to the Fee Interests and leased real property interests.
The cost of such title insurance policies will be for the account of Buyer.
In this connection therewith, Seller shall enter into any customary and
reasonable affidavits as may be reasonably required by the title company to
issue the title insurance policy to Buyer. 

Section 7.21. _Financial Statements_. Seller shall have prepared by a
certified public accounting firm and delivered to Buyer, within 60 days
following the Closing (a) financial audits for the Companies and the Business
for the years ending December 31, 2012, and 2011, (b) any other financial
statements required in connection with the financing efforts or capital
markets transactions undertaken by Buyer or its Affiliates or otherwise
required by Buyer for financial reporting purposes, and (c) financials
required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Furthermore, Seller shall
request the independent public accountants of Seller and the Companies (at
BuyerÂ’s expense) to provide any consent necessary to the filing of such
financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to
provide such customary representation letters as are necessary in connection
therewith.

_Article VIII_. _Buyer Â’s Due Diligence Examination_

Section 8.1. _Due Diligence Examination_. Each Seller Company shall,
through the Title Post-Closing Defect Date as to Title Defects and through
the Environmental Post-Closing Defect Date as to Environmental Defects (each
such period being an "Examination Period") afford Buyer and its
authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to
the records of such Seller Company at the offices of Seller for the purposes
of determining whether Title Defects (as defined below) or Environmental
Defects (as defined below) exist ("BuyerÂ’s Review"); provided, however, that
such investigation shall be upon reasonable notice and shall not unreasonably
disrupt the personnel and operations of Seller or such Company or impede the
efforts of Seller or such Company to comply with their other obligations
under this Agreement. Such books and records shall include files, assignments,
operating records and agreements, financial and accounting records,
engineering records, in each case insofar as same may now be in existence and
in the possession of a Company or Seller or their Affiliates, excluding,
however, any information that a Company is prohibited from disclosing by bona
fide, third party confidentiality restrictions; provided, that: (i) any
information withheld on such basis shall be identified with as much
specificity and detail as reasonably possible without breaching such
obligation, and (ii) if requested by Buyer, such Company shall use its
Reasonable Efforts to obtain a waiver of any such restrictions in favor of
Buyer. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, Seller shall give
Buyer, or BuyerÂ’s authorized representatives, at all reasonable times during
the Pre-Closing portion of the Examination Period and upon adequate notice to
Seller, physical access to the Properties for the purpose of inspecting same.
Furthermore, Seller shall use Reasonable Efforts to cooperate and cause
Employees retained by Seller or its Affiliates to cooperate with Buyer in its
review during the Post-Closing portion of the Examination Period. The cost and
expense of BuyerÂ’s Review, if any, shall be borne solely by Buyer. Buyer shall
not, prior to the Closing, contact any of the customers or suppliers of
Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in
person or by telephone, mail or other means of communication, without the
specific prior authorization of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 



39 Section 8.2. _Assertion of Title and Environmental Defects_. If, at any time
prior to the Title Post-Closing Defect Date or Environmental Post-Closing
Defect Date, as applicable, Buyer discovers any Defects, then the parties
shall resolve such Title Defect or Environmental Defect, as applicable, as
follows: 

(a) Should there be one or more of such Title Defects, Buyer shall notify
Seller in writing of such Title Defects as promptly as practicable but in any
event, no later than twenty (20) Business Days, after BuyerÂ’s Knowledge of
such Defect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure to provide such twenty
(20) Business Days notice shall not adversely impact the rights of Buyer with
respect to such Title Defect except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices Seller. If Buyer determines that it is unwilling to waive a Title
Defect, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of such Title Defects no later
than the date that is three (3) months after the Closing Date (the "Title
Post-Closing Defect Date"). Such Title Defects of which Buyer so provides
notice are herein called "Asserted Title Defects." In the event that Buyer so
notifies Seller of any Asserted Title Defect, Seller shall have the right (but
not the obligation) to attempt to cure such Asserted Title Defect to the
reasonable satisfaction of Buyer within 90 days (or 180 days if the Asserted
Title Defect relates to the Easements described in Section 4.28 of the
Disclosure Schedule, provided the term of the Title Defects Escrow shall be
extended for the same period as the cure period is extended) after SellerÂ’s
receipt of such notice; provided, however, that the exercise of any such right
to cure (x) shall be coordinated with Buyer, (y) shall not unreasonably
interfere with either CompanyÂ’s operations or impair the current or future
use of the Properties in any material respect and (z) shall not impose any
monetary obligations upon Buyer or the Company or any restrictions upon the
conduct of the Business (the "Cure Conditions"). All matters that could
constitute a Title Defect that are not Asserted Titled Defects are waived by
Buyer. At any time prior to the Title Post-Closing Defect Date, if Seller or
any Company (prior to Closing) becomes aware of any Title Defect or
any allegation by a Person that, if true, would result in a Title Defect,
Seller shall as promptly as practicable, but in any event, within twenty (20)
Business Days after Knowledge of such Defect (or prior to the Title Post-
Closing Defect Date if the Title Post-Closing Defect Date would occur during
such twenty Business Day period), notify Buyer in writing of such Title Defect
or allegation with respect thereto.

 

(b) Should there be one or more Environmental Defects, Buyer shall notify
Seller in writing of such Environmental Defects as promptly as practicable,
but in any event, no later than twenty (20) Business Days after BuyerÂ’s
Knowledge of such Defect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure to
provide such twenty (20) Business Days notice shall not adversely impact the
rights of Buyer with respect to such Environmental Defect except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices Seller. If Buyer determines that it is
unwilling to waive an Environmental Defect, Buyer shall notify Seller
in writing of such Environmental Defects no later than the date that is six
(6) months after the Closing Date (the "Environmental Post-Closing Defect
Date"). Such Environmental Defects of which Buyer so provides notice are
herein called "Asserted Environmental Defects". In the event that Buyer so
notifies Seller of any Asserted Environmental Defect, Seller shall have the
right (but not the obligation) to attempt to cure such Asserted Environmental
Defect to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer within 90 days after SellerÂ’s

 



40  receipt of such notice, subject to the Cure Conditions. All matters that
could constitute an Environmental Defect that are not Asserted Environmental
Defects are waived by Buyer. At any time prior to the Environmental Post-
Closing Defect Date, if Seller or any Company (prior to Closing) becomes aware
of any Environmental Defect or any allegation by a Person that, if true, would
result in an Environmental Defect, Seller shall as promptly as practicable,
but in any event, within twenty (20) Business Days of Knowledge of such Defect
(or prior to the Environmental Post-Closing Defect Date if the Environmental
Post-Closing Defect Date would occur during such twenty Business Day period),
notify Buyer in writing of such Environmental Defect or allegation with
respect thereto.

To be effective, a notice pursuant to this Section 8.2 ("Defect Notice") must
(i) be in writing, (ii) describe the Defect in reasonable detail, (iii)
identify the specific Properties to which such Defect relates and (iv) include
the Defect Amount (if the Defect can be reasonably estimated) as determined
by Buyer in good faith. It being expressly understood that BuyerÂ’s sole and
exclusive rights and remedies with respect to any matter that constitutes a
Defect shall be those set forth in this Article VIII, and Buyer shall not
(absent fraud) be entitled to indemnification or any other right or remedy
with respect to any Defect.

Section 8.3. _Title Defect Amount_. The "Title Defect Amount" resulting from a
Title Defect shall be the amount by which the value of the Title Defect
Property is reasonably reduced as a result of the existence of such Title
Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:

(a) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(b) if a Title Defect is a Lien that is undisputed and liquidated in amount,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to
remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

(c) if a Title Defect represents an obligation or Lien upon or other defect in
title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above, the Title
Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the portion of the
Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the
Title Defect, the reasonably estimated potential economic effect of the Title
Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the values and estimated
cost to cure placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller and such other
reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; provided,
however, that if such Title Defect is reasonably capable of being cured, the
Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than the reasonable cost and expense
of curing such Title Defect;

 

(d) if a Title Defect relates to an ownership gap in a right-of-way included
in the Property, the Title Defect Amount shall be the reasonable estimated
costs and expenses necessary to cure such gap, or alternatively, to construct
an alternative route for the pipeline system around such gap, including the
cost of acquiring any necessary real property right-of-way and related
capital expenditures; and

 



41 (e) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall
be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder.

Section 8.4.  _Title Defects_. "Title Defect" shall mean (a) a defect exists
that causes Seller to not have Defensible Title to all or part of the
Pipeline, Easements, Fee Interests or certain Permits (to the extent
such Properties are in the nature of a real property interest or an easement
or right to use real property) or (b) any inaccuracy in or breach of a
representation or warranty contained in Section 4.26 (Preference
Rights), Section 4.28 (Easements) and Section 4.31 (Fort Berthold Indian
Reservation) to the extent relating to title matters with respect to the
Pipeline, Easements, Fee Interests or such Permits. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the following matters shall not
constitute, and shall not be asserted as, a Title Defect: (i) defects or
irregularities arising out of lack of corporate authorization or variation in
corporate or entity name; (ii) defects or irregularities that have been cured
or remedied by the applicable statutes of limitation or statutes for
prescription; (iii) defects or irregularities in the chain of title consisting
of the failure to recite marital status in documents or omissions of heirship
Proceedings; and (iv) Permitted Liens. The fact that the options listed on
Section 8.4 of the Disclosure Schedule have not been recorded shall not
constitute a "Title Defect" for the purposes of this Agreement.

Section 8.5. _Environmental Defects_. The term "Environmental Defect" means
(a) a situation with respect to or condition of the Properties existing on or
prior to the Effective Date that causes such Property (or a Company with
respect to such Property) to not be in compliance with or gives rise to
liability of a Company under Applicable Environmental Laws or (b) any
inaccuracy in or breach of Sections 4.10 or 4.14 to the extent relating to
environmental matters. The "Environmental Defect Amount" shall mean the sum
of, if any, (i) the amount by which the value of the affected Property is
diminished as the result of such Environmental Defect, (ii) the costs and
expenses required to be paid to remedy the Environmental Defect, and (iii)
any Damages incurred by the Companies as a result of such Environmental Defect
(including fines and penalties assessed by Governmental Authorities).

Section 8.6. _Certain Pre-Closing Defect Adjustments_. If Asserted Title
Defects or Asserted Environmental Defects are presented to Seller on or before
the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to Closing (the "First Defect Date"), and
Seller is unable (or unwilling) to cure to BuyerÂ’s reasonable satisfaction
before Closing, then:

 

(a) Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the Defect
Amount.

 

(b) For Asserted Title Defects (i) for which a Defect Notice was given by
Buyer on or before the First Defect Date, and (ii) for which the associated
reduction has been agreed upon by Buyer and Seller prior to Closing, the Base
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the agreed Defect Amount for such Asserted
Title.

 

(c) For Asserted Environmental Defects (i) for which a Defect Notice was given
by Buyer on or before the First Defect Date, and (ii) for which the
associated reduction has been agreed upon by Buyer and Seller prior to
Closing, the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the agreed Defect Amount
for such Asserted Environmental Defects.

 



42 (d) For each Asserted Title Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect (i) for
which notice was given by Buyer on or before the First Defect Date, and (ii)
for which the validity of or associated reduction has not been agreed prior to
Closing, the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Defect
Amount proposed by Buyer in good faith, and the Defect Amount shall be
determined in accordance with Section 16.2.

(e) If, after the completion of the mediation regarding any Asserted Title
Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect for which the Base Purchase Price was
reduced pursuant to Section 8.6(d), the Defect Amount determined by the
mediator(s) with respect to such Asserted Title Defect or Asserted
Environmental Defect exceeds BuyerÂ’s proposed Defect Amount, Seller shall pay
Buyer within five (5) Business Days after the completion of such mediation an
amount equal to (i) the Defect Amount determined by the mediator for such
Asserted Title Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect minus (ii) BuyerÂ’s
proposed Defect Amount for such Asserted Title Defect or
Asserted Environmental Defect.

(f) If, after the completion of the mediation regarding any Asserted Title
Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect for which the Base Purchase Price was
reduced pursuant to Section 8.6(d), the Defect Amount determined by the
mediator(s) with respect to such Asserted Title Defect or Asserted
Environmental Defect is less than BuyerÂ’s proposed Defect Amount for such
Asserted Title Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect, Buyer shall pay Seller
within five (5) Business Days after the completion of such mediation an amount
equal to (i) BuyerÂ’s proposed Defect Amount for such Asserted Title Defect or
Asserted Environmental Defect minus (ii) the Defect Amount determined by the
mediator for such Asserted Title Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect.

 

Section 8.7. _Certain Post-Closing Price Adjustments for Asserted Title
Defects_. If Asserted Title Defects or Asserted Environmental Defects are
presented to Seller after the First Defect Date but on or before the Title
Post-Closing Defect Date or Environmental Post-Closing Defect Date, as
applicable, and Seller is unable (or unwilling) to cure to BuyerÂ’s reasonable
satisfaction by or before the date that is ninety (90) days after the Title
Post-Closing Defect Date or Environmental Post-Closing Defect Date, as
applicable, (the "Cure Date"), then:

 

(a) Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to agree upon a Defect Amount
to be paid to Buyer to account for such Asserted Title Defect or Asserted
Environmental Defect.

(b) If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree prior to the Cure Date upon the
Defect Amount to be paid to Buyer with respect to any Asserted Title Defect or
Asserted Environmental Defect (or the validity thereof), the amount to be paid
shall be determined in accordance with Section 16.2. 

 



43 (c) After the completion of the mediation or other Proceeding regarding
any Asserted Title Defect under this Section 8.7, Seller shall pay Buyer
within five (5) Business Days the Defect Amount determined by the mediator for
such Asserted Title Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect.

 

Section 8.8. _Limits on Liability_

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, it
is expressly understood that Seller shall not have any payment obligation (a)
with respect to any Title Defect Amount pursuant to this Article VIII unless

Defect Deductible, only to the extent such amount exceeds the Title Defect
Deductible or (b) for an aggregate amount of Title Defect Amounts exceeding
the Title Escrow Amount.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, it
is expressly understood that Seller shall not have any payment obligation (a)

event such aggregate exceeds the Environmental Defect Deductible, only to the
extent such amount exceeds the Environmental Defect Deductible or (b) for an
aggregate amount of Environmental Defect Amounts exceeding the Environmental
Escrow Amount.

to extension pursuant to Section 8.2(a) and subject to continuation for

entitled for such claim under this Article VIII. If, however, Seller disputes
such claim within ten (10) Business Days of delivery of such claim, Buyer

hereunder (other than as specifically provided in Section 11.2 hereof, which
will survive the termination). If Buyer proceeds to Closing with Knowledge of
any condition precedent above not being met by Seller, such
condition precedent will be deemed waived by Buyer as a condition to Closing
and Buyer hereby waives any claims for a breach of representation and warranty
related thereto. With respect to any condition set forth above which is not
met (and which is asserted by Buyer as a failure of one of its conditions of
Closing), and for which the reasons why such condition is not met relate to
some, but less than all, of the Properties, Seller may require that any
dispute with regard to whether or not such condition was met and any failure
of such condition to be met be treated as an uncured Environmental Defect or
Title Defect and handled in accordance with the process set forth in Article
VIII, and, if Seller so requires such handling, such condition will be
considered met for the purposes of this Section.

Section 9.2. _Conditions Precedent to the Obligations of Seller_. The
obligations of Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are subject to each of the following conditions being met or waived
by Seller:

 

(a) Each and every representation of Buyer contained in Article VI shall be
true and accurate in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date as
if made on and as of such date, except (i) as affected by transactions
contemplated or permitted by this Agreement and (ii) to the extent that any
such representation or warranty is made as of a specified date, in which case
such representation or warranty shall have been true and correct in all
material respects as of such specified date.

(b) Buyer shall have performed and complied in all material respects with (or
compliance therewith shall have been waived by Seller) each and every covenant
and agreement required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by
Buyer prior to or at the Closing.

(c) The aggregate downward adjustment (if any) to the Base Purchase Price
which results from the procedures set forth in Article VIII does not exceed
twenty percent (20%) of the Base Purchase Price.

 

(d) No Proceeding shall, on the date of Closing, be pending or threatened
before any court or Governmental Entity seeking to restrain, prohibit, or
obtain material damages or other material relief in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



47 (e) No order, writ, injunction or decree shall have been entered and be
in effect by any court or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction,
and no statute, rule, regulation or other requirement shall have been
promulgated or enacted and be in effect, that on a temporary or permanent
basis restrains, enjoins or invalidates the transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) Seller and the Companies shall have received all other agreements,
instruments and documents which are required by other terms of this Agreement
to be executed or delivered by Buyer or any other party to Seller or a Company
prior to or in connection with the Closing.

 

(g) The consummation of the transactions contemplated under the terms of this
Agreement is not prevented from occurring by (and the required waiting
period, if any, has expired under) the HSR Act and the rules and regulations
of the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.

 

(h) Buyer shall have delivered to Seller the certificate contemplated in
Section 10.3(b).

 

(i) If Buyer assigns its rights and obligations under this Agreement to an
Affiliate of Buyer, such assignee shall be a limited liability company formed
under the laws of the State of Delaware.

If any such condition on the obligations of Seller under this Agreement is
not met, or the Closing does not occur on or before the Termination Date, and
(in either case) Seller or the Companies are not in breach of their
obligations hereunder, this Agreement may, at the option of Seller,
be terminated, in which case the parties shall have no further obligations to
one another hereunder (other than as specifically provided in Section 11.2
hereof, which will survive the termination). If Seller proceeds to Closing
with Knowledge of any condition precedent above not being met by Buyer, such
condition precedent will be deemed waived by Seller as a condition to Closing
and Seller hereby waives any claims for a breach of representation or warranty
related thereto.

50 _Article XII_. _Accounting Adjustments_

 

Section 12.1. _Adjustments for Revenues and Expenses_.

 

(a) Buyer will bear all expenses which are incurred in the operation of the
Companies and the Properties on or after the Purchase Price Adjustment Date
and Buyer will receive all revenues and all documented reimbursements by the
Companies to Buyer of amounts expended by Buyer or Seller after the Purchase
Price Adjustment Date for continuing operations of the Companies in the
ordinary course of business (net of applicable ad valorem and real property
Taxes pursuant to subsection (b)(ii) below) which are attributable to the
Companies and Properties on or after the Purchase Price Adjustment Date.

 

(b) Appropriate adjustments to the Base Purchase Price shall be made between
Buyer and Seller through application of the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount
so that:

(i) Seller will bear all expenses which are incurred in the operation of the
Companies and the Properties before the Purchase Price Adjustment Date and
Seller will receive all revenues and all documented reimbursements by the
Companies to Seller of amounts expended by Seller prior to the Purchase
Price Adjustment Date for continuing the operations of the Companies in the
ordinary course of business not reflected in Net Working Capital (net of
applicable ad valorem and real property Taxes pursuant to subsection (b)(ii)
below) which are attributable to the Companies and the Properties before the
Purchase Price Adjustment Date.

(ii) In making such adjustments:

(A) Ad valorem and similar Taxes assessed for periods prior to the Purchase
Price Adjustment Date shall be borne by Seller and the ad valorem Taxes
assessed for periods on or after the Purchase Price Adjustment Date shall be
borne by Buyer;

(B) Ad valorem and similar Taxes assessed with respect to a period which
begins before and ends after the Purchase Price Adjustment Date shall be
prorated based on the number of days in such period which fall on each side
of the Purchase Price Adjustment Date (with the day on which the Purchase
Price Adjustment Date falls being counted in the period after the Purchase
Price Adjustment Date); and

 

(C) no consideration shall be given to the local, state or federal income Tax
liabilities of any party.

 

Section 12.2. _Initial Adjustment at Closing_. At least five (5) days before
the Closing Date, Seller shall provide to Buyer (i) SellerÂ’s good faith
estimated balance sheets of the Companies as of 11:59 p.m. local time on the
day immediately preceding the Purchase Price Adjustment Date (the "Estimated
Purchase Price Adjustment Date Balance Sheet");

 



51  (ii) SellerÂ’s good faith estimate of the Net Working Capital of the
Companies (the "Estimated Net Working Capital") and (iii) SellerÂ’s good faith
estimate of the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount (the "Estimated Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount"). The Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Date
Balance Sheet, the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Estimated Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount (collectively, the "Estimated Closing Items") shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with past
practice and consistent with the principles and assumptions used in
preparation of the audited consolidated balance sheet of Seller as of
December 31, 2011 and the Net Working Capital Illustration attached as Exhibit
1.1(b) hereto. Seller shall furnish to Buyer, together with such computations,
copies of back-up and other supporting information that reasonably supports
such computations. If Buyer disputes SellerÂ’s computations, it shall notify
Seller within two (2) Business Days of receipt of the Estimated Closing Items
and shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such objections.
If Buyer fails to give notice of objection within such two (2) Business Day
period, then each Company and Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted SellerÂ’s
Estimated Closing Items. If Buyer does timely dispute SellerÂ’s computations,
Buyer and Seller shall endeavor in good faith to resolve any disputed matters
prior to Closing. If Buyer and Seller are unable to so resolve any disputed
matters prior to Closing, (A) at Closing, the Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount shall be based on SellerÂ’s computation, (B) the dispute resolution
provisions of Section 12.3(c) shall be available post-Closing, and (C) any
disputed amounts shall be immediately placed in escrow in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. If the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount is a positive number, the Base Purchase Price shall be increased by an
amount equal to the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Amount. If the
Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Base
Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount equal to the absolute value of
the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Amount.

 

Section 12.3. _Adjustment Post Closing._

 

(a) On or before ninety (90) days after Closing, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller (i) balance sheets of the Companies as of 11:59 p.m. local
time on the day immediately preceding the Purchase Price Adjustment Date (the
"Final Purchase Price Adjustment Date Balance Sheet"); (ii) BuyerÂ’s
calculation of the Net Working Capital of the Companies (the "Final Net
Working Capital"); and (iii) BuyerÂ’s calculation of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount (the "Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount"), in each
case, together with a worksheet showing the difference, if any, between any
Estimated Closing Item and the corresponding Final Closing Item (as defined
below). The Final Purchase Price Adjustment Date Balance Sheet, the Final Net
Working Capital and the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount (collectively,
the "Final Closing Items") shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
on a basis consistent with past practice and consistent with the principles
and assumptions used in preparation of the audited consolidated balance sheet
of the Companies as of December 31, 2011 and the Estimated Closing Items.

(b) Seller will assist Buyer in the preparation of the Final Closing Items by
providing Buyer with any data or information within SellerÂ’s control that is
reasonably requested by Buyer. The Final Closing Items shall become final and
binding upon the parties on the thirtieth (30th) day following receipt thereof
by Seller, unless Seller gives

 



52  written notice of its disagreement to Buyer prior to such date. In order to
be valid, any such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the dollar
amount, nature and basis of any disagreement so asserted. If the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 12.3 exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, Buyer
shall promptly deliver to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated by Seller, an amount equal to such excess
within five (5) Business Days after the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Date
Balance Sheet becomes final. If the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount exceeds the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 12.3, Seller shall promptly deliver to
Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by Buyer, an amount equal to such excess within five (5) Business
Days after the Final Closing Items become final. If the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount as finally determined pursuant to this Section 12.3 is equal
to the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, neither Seller nor Buyer
shall have any further obligation under this Section 12.3.

(c) If Buyer and Seller cannot agree upon the Estimated Closing Items or the
Final Closing Items, the Dispute shall be submitted to an independent public
accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller (in either case, the
"Independent Expert"), which firm shall make a final and binding determination
as to all matters in dispute relating to the calculations set forth in the
Estimated Closing Items or Final Closing Items as promptly as practicable
after its appointment. The Independent Expert shall send its written
determination of the adjustments provided for in Section 12.3 and Section 12.3
to Buyer and Seller, together with a calculation of the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount that results from such determination, and such determination
of the Independent Expert, and the resulting calculations of the adjustments
provided for in Section 12.2 and Section 12.3, shall be binding on the
parties, absent fraud or manifest error; provided, however, that in no event
shall the Independent Expert assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such items claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such items claimed by either party. The fees and expenses
of the Independent Expert shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

Section 12.4. _No Further Adjustments_. Following the adjustments under
Section 12.3, no further adjustments shall be made under this Article XII.
Should any expenses with regard to the Properties be charged to (or received
by) Seller or Buyer after the earlier of (i) the conclusion of such
adjustments under Section 12.3 or (ii) ninety (90) days after Closing, the
same shall be paid by Buyer, regardless of the periods to which the same
relate, and any bills received by Seller will be forwarded to Buyer; provided
Buyer shall be entitled to receive a reimbursement of any such payment from
the Escrow Account to the extent the amount paid would otherwise have been
payable by Seller if known at the time of preparation of the Final Settlement
Amount.

 

 _Article XIII_. _Indemnification_

Section 13.1. _Indemnification by Buyer_. From and after the Closing, Buyer
shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller (and its Affiliates, their respective
successors and assigns and their respective owners, directors, officers,
managers and employees) harmless from and against

 



53  any and all Damages (individually, a "SellerÂ’s Indemnified Claim" and,
collectively, "SellerÂ’s Indemnified Claims") to the extent arising from or
related to any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or
agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement that survives Closing and any
breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement.

 

THE FOREGOING ASSUMPTIONS AND INDEMNIFICATIONS BY BUYER SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR
NOT SUCH DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES, OR SUCH CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES
OF ACTION, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES ARISE OUT OF (i)
NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXPRESSLY NOT INCLUDING GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) OF ANY INDEMNITEE, (ii) STRICT LIABILITY,
OR (iii) ANY VIOLATION OF ANY LAW, RULE, REGULATION OR ORDER RELATED TO THE
OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF THE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL
LAWS.

 

Section 13.2. _Indemnification by Seller_.

 

(a) From and after Closing, Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold Buyer (and
its Affiliates, their respective successors and assigns and their respective
owners, directors, officers, managers and employees) harmless from and against
any and all Damages (individually a "BuyerÂ’s Indemnified Claim" and
collectively "BuyerÂ’s Indemnified Claims") to the extent arising out of or
related to (i) any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty of Seller or a
Company contained in this Agreement that survives the Closing, (ii) any breach
of any covenant or agreement of Seller or a Company contained in this
Agreement that survives the Closing, or (iii) the Retained Liabilities.

THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATIONS BY SELLER SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH
DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES, OR SUCH CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION,
LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES ARISE OUT OF (i) NEGLIGENCE
(INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE
OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXPRESSLY NOT INCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT) OF ANY INDEMNITEE, (ii) STRICT LIABILITY, OR (iii) ANY VIOLATION
OF ANY LAW, RULE, REGULATION OR ORDER RELATED TO THE OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF
THE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, it is expressly understood that
Seller shall not have any obligation to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Buyer (or its owners, directors, officers, and employees) with respect to any
BuyerÂ’s Indemnified Claims made under Section 13.2(a)(i) unless the aggregate
of such BuyerÂ’s Indemnified Claims exceeds $10,000,000 (the "Deductible"),
and in the event such BuyerÂ’s Indemnified Claims exceed the Deductible, only
the value of Damages in excess of the Deductible shall be considered in
applying Section 13.2(a)(i), provided, however, that the representations and
warranties referenced in Section 13.3(a)(iii) shall not be subject

 



54  to the Deductible. In no event shall Seller have liability pursuant to or in
connection with any claim under Section 13.2(a)(i) of this Agreement for
Damages in excess of $95,000,000 (the "Cap"); provided however, that the
representations and warranties referenced in Section 13.3(a)(iii) shall not be
subject to the Cap.

 

(c) Nothing in this Article XIII shall apply to Damages with respect to any
and all Defects, the Damages with respect to which shall be governed
exclusively by Article VIII.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer (and
its Affiliates, their respective successors and assigns and their respective
owners, directors, officers, and employees) shall be deemed not to have
suffered any Damages under this Section 13.2 arising from claims based on
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses included in the calculation of the
Purchase Price or in the preparation of the Final Settlement Statement. It is
the intent of the Parties that (i) the procedures set forth in Article XII
and the dispute resolution procedures referenced in Article XVI shall provide
the sole and exclusive remedies for claims relating to the preparation of the
Final Settlement Statement and the determination of the Purchase Price and
(ii) Buyer shall not have recourse pursuant to Section 13.2 for breaches of
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement to the extent that
the facts constituting any such breaches are taken into account in preparing
the Final Settlement Statement pursuant to Section 12.3 or in determining the
Purchase Price.

(e) For purposes of Section 13.2 in determining whether Seller has breached
any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement and for
the determination of liability and Damages under this Article XIII, all
qualifications of such representations and warranties by materiality (whether
by reference to the terms "material", "Material Adverse Effect" or otherwise)
shall be disregarded. 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted as limiting a
PartyÂ’s right to seek and receive recovery for fraud committed by the other
Party.

Section 13.3. _Survival of Provisions_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties shall not survive the Closing, except
as follows:

 

(i) the representations and warranties of Seller contained in Section 3.6
(Approvals) and the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in
Section 6.5 (Approvals) shall survive the Closing for a period of nine (9)
months from the Closing Date;

(ii) Except as set forth in clauses (i) and (iv) of this Section 13.3(a) and
except for Section 4.11 (Taxes) which is addressed in Section 7.11, all
other representations of Seller contained in Articles III and IV and all
other representations of Buyer contained in Article VI shall survive for a
period of twelve (12) months from the Closing Date; and

 



55 (iii) the representations of Seller contained in Section 3.1 (Title to
Interests), Section 3.2 (Organization and Standing), Section 3.3 (Power and
Authority), Section 3.4 (Valid and Binding Agreement)), Section 4.1
(Organization and Standing), Section 4.3 (Capital Structure), Section 4.4
(Power and Authority, and the representations of Buyer contained in Section
6.1 (Organization and Standing), Section 6.2 (Power and Authority),
and Section 6.3 (Valid and Binding Agreement) shall survive the Closing
without limitation.

(b) All covenants of Seller, a Company or Buyer contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing for a period of six (6) months after the Closing
except (i) for any covenant which by its terms continues for a longer period
which shall continue for such specified longer period and (ii) except for the
covenants contained in Sections 7.7, 7.13, 7.18 and Articles XII, XIII, XVI
and XVII which shall survive the Closing for the applicable statute of
limitations period. Written notice of any claim by Buyer for indemnification
from Seller under Section 13.2 arising during the Survival Period must be
given by Buyer to Seller as a condition precedent to the right to enforce
such claim for indemnification but in any event no later than the end of the
Survival Period. Buyer agrees to bring an indemnification claim within ninety
(90) days after such claim becomes known to Buyer, provided any failure to
do so shall not adversely impact the claim except to the extent of any actual
prejudice to Seller. In the event a BuyerÂ’s Indemnified Claim is timely and
properly asserted, the covenants set forth in Section 13.2 shall survive
until such BuyerÂ’s Indemnified Claim is satisfied, but only with respect to
such timely and properly asserted BuyerÂ’s Indemnified Claim.

(c) The applicable survival period for representations and warranties as
reflected in Section 13.3(a) above and for covenants reflected in Section
13.3(b) above shall be referred to as the "Survival Period."

Section 13.4. _Notice of Claim_. If indemnification pursuant to Sections 13.1
or 13.2 is sought, the party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnitee") shall
give written notice to the indemnifying party of an event giving rise to the
obligation to indemnify, describing in reasonable detail the factual basis
for such claim, and shall allow the indemnifying party to assume and conduct
the defense of the claim or action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee, and cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense thereof;
provided, however, that the omission to give such notice to the indemnifying
party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may
have to the Indemnitee, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is
prejudiced by the failure to give such notice and as otherwise provided in
Section 13.3. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel
to represent the Indemnitee if the Indemnitee is advised by counsel that an
actual conflict of interest makes it advisable for the Indemnitee to be
represented by separate counsel and the reasonable expenses and fees of such
separate counsel shall be paid by the indemnifying party.

 

Section 13.5. _No Commissions Owed_. Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold Buyer (and its partners and its and their Affiliates, and the respective
owners, officers, directors, employees, attorneys, contractors and agents of
such parties) harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of
action, liabilities, damages, losses, costs or expenses (including, without
limitation, court costs and attorneyÂ’s fees) of any kind or character arising
out of or

 



56  resulting from any agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to have
been made by, or on behalf of, Seller or a Company with any broker or finder
in connection with this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby.
Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller (and its partners and its
and their Affiliates (including without limitation Yorktown Energy Partners
VII, L.P., Yorktown Energy Partners VIII, L.P., and Yorktown Energy Partners
IX, L.P.) and the respective owners, officers, directors, employees,
attorneys, contractors and agents of such parties) harmless from and against
any and all claims, actions, causes of action, liabilities, damages, losses,
costs or expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and attorneyÂ’s
fees) of any kind or character arising out of or resulting from any agreement,
arrangement or understanding alleged to have been made by, or on behalf of,
Buyer, with any broker or finder in connection with this Agreement or the
transaction contemplated hereby.

Section 13.6. _Net Amounts_.Any amounts recoverable by any party pursuant to
this Article XIII with respect to any BuyerÂ’s Indemnified Claims or SellerÂ’s
Indemnified Claims, as the case may be, shall be decreased by any insurance
proceeds or other amounts relating to such BuyerÂ’s Indemnified Claims or
SellerÂ’s Indemnified Claims, as the case may be, paid to such Indemnitee by
any Person (other than any Affiliate of such Indemnitee) not a party to this
Agreement within twenty-four (24) months following the Closing Date.

Section 13.7. _Post-Closing Escrow._

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 13.7, Buyer
shall cause the Indemnity Escrow Amount to be deposited on the Closing Date
with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) The Indemnity Escrow Amount will be utilized solely to satisfy any
indemnification obligations of Seller to Buyer under Section 13.2 and to
cover other amounts which can expressly be paid out of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount as provided in Section 12.2 in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. The Escrow Agreement shall, subject to paragraph (c) of this
Section 13.7, have a term of twelve (12) months commencing on the Closing
Date, subject to continuation for disputed claims (the "Indemnity Escrow
Term"). The Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Indemnity Escrow Amount
may be drawn upon by Buyer, its successors or assigns solely for the purpose
of satisfying any indemnification obligations of Seller under Section 13.2 and
to cover other amounts which can expressly be paid from the Escrow in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(c) If Buyer asserts a claim against the Indemnity Escrow Amount under this
Article XIII and Seller does not dispute such claim, Buyer shall be entitled
to indemnification by Seller in accordance with this Article XIII, including
the right to receive from the Indemnity Escrow Amount funds in an amount
equal to the amount of Damages for which Buyer is entitled for such claim
under this Article XIII. If, however, Seller disputes such claim, Buyer shall
receive the undisputed portion thereof, if any, but shall not be entitled to
receive any such disputed portion thereof from the Indemnity Escrow Amount
with respect to such claim prior to resolution of such dispute in accordance
with Article XVI of this Agreement and, if such dispute extends beyond the
expiration of the Indemnity Escrow Term, the term of the Indemnity Escrow
Term will be automatically extended as provided in paragraph (d) of this
Section 13.7.

 



57 (d) Provided the indemnification obligations of Seller for claims
of indemnification under this Article XIII of which Seller has been notified
prior to the expiration of the Indemnity Escrow Term have been satisfied and
no dispute then exists as to any claim for indemnification by Buyer for such
claims, the balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount plus the earned interest
and other income will be released to Seller on the first Business Day
immediately following the expiration of the Indemnity Escrow Term. To the
extent there does exist a claim for indemnification by Buyer of which Seller
has been notified, which claim has not been satisfied in full in accordance
herewith prior to the expiration of the Indemnity Escrow Term, an amount equal
to the reasonable estimate of the amount of such claim hereunder by Seller
will be withheld from the balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount and will
continue to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement until such claim has been fully resolved and the Indemnity Escrow
Term shall be deemed to be extended accordingly.

reasonably requested, to implement the terms hereof and to disburse the

 _Article XIV_. _Casualty Losses_

Section 14.1. _Casualty Loss_. In the event of damage by fire or other
casualty to the Properties after the date of this Agreement but prior to the
Closing when such casualty losses involve less than five million dollars
($5,000,000.00) and can reasonably be repaired within thirty (30) days and are
not otherwise material to the ability of the Companies to conduct the
Business, then: (a) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; (b)
Buyer shall take title to the Property affected by such damage without
reduction of the Purchase Price; and (c) Seller shall, at BuyerÂ’s sole
election, either (i) assign to Buyer any property damage insurance claims
related to such damage and pay any deductibles, or (ii) repair or replace such
damaged property to a condition similar to the condition of the affected
Property immediately prior to the fire or other casualty and retain
all insurance claims and payments with respect thereto.

Section 14.2. _Right to Termination_. In the event of damages by fire or
other casualty to the Properties after the date of this Agreement but prior to
the Closing other than a casualty loss referenced in Section 14.1 above, then
Buyer may terminate this Agreement by notice to Seller. 

Section 14.3. _Maintenance of Insurance Coverage_. Until the Closing Date,
Seller shall maintain the existing insurance coverage, and in the event of a
casualty loss which is not covered by insurance, except as provided in this
Section, Seller shall have no obligation to Buyer with respect thereto;
provided that, if Buyer so requests, and if Seller has not repaired the
damage or replaced the affected Property, Seller will assign any rights it may
have against third parties with respect to such damage.

 _Article XVI._ _Dispute Resolution_

Any and all claims, disputes, controversies or other matters in question
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or to the computation of the
Purchase Price adjusted pursuant to Section 12.3 (all of which are referred
to herein as "Disputes") shall be resolved solely in accordance with this
Article XVI, even though some or all of such Disputes are allegedly extra
contractual in nature, whether such Disputes sound in contract, tort, or
otherwise, at law or in equity, under state or federal law, whether provided
by statute or the common law, for damages or any other relief.

 

Section 16.1. _Senior Management Meeting_. If a Dispute occurs that the senior
representatives of the parties responsible for the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement have been unable, in good faith, to settle or agree upon
within a period of fifteen (15) days after written notice is given of such
Dispute, Seller shall nominate and commit one of its senior officers, and
Buyer shall nominate and commit one of its senior officers, to meet at a
mutually agreed time and place not later than thirty (30) days after written
notice of the Dispute to attempt to resolve same.

 

Section 16.2. _Mediation_. If such senior management has been unable to
resolve such Dispute within a period of fifteen (15) days after such meeting,
or if such meeting has not occurred within forty-five (45) days following such
written notice of such Dispute, any party may by notice to the other party
require mediation of the Dispute, which notice shall identify the names of no
fewer than three (3) potential mediators. Each party will in good faith

Association in effect on the date of this Agreement. If such dispute shall not
have been resolved by mediation within thirty (30) days of the initiation of
such procedure, or which has not been resolved prior to the termination of
mediation, this Agreement does not preclude either party from initiating
litigation upon fifteen (15) days written notice to the other party.

_Article XVII._ _Miscellaneous Matters_

 

Section 17.1. _Further Assurances_. After the Closing, Seller shall execute
and deliver, and shall otherwise cause to be executed and delivered, from
time to time, such further instruments, notices, division orders, transfer
orders and other documents, and do such other and further acts and things, as
may be reasonably necessary to more fully and effectively grant, convey and
assign the Interests and the Properties to Buyer and the Companies, as
applicable.

 



60 Section 17.2. _Waiver of Consumer Rights_. Buyer hereby waives its
rights under the Texas Deceptive Trade PracticesÂ—Consumer Protection Act,
Section 17.41 _et seq._, Business and Commerce Code, a law that gives
consumers special rights and protections, and any similar law in any other
state to the extent such Act or similar law would otherwise apply. After
consultation with an attorney of BuyerÂ’s own selection, Buyer voluntarily
consents to this waiver. To evidence BuyerÂ’s ability to grant such waiver,
Buyer represents to Seller that it (a) is in the business of seeking or
acquiring, by purchase or lease, goods or services for commercial or business
use, (b) has knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that
enable it to evaluate the merits and risks of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (c) is not in a significantly disparate bargaining position, and (d)
has consulted with, and is represented by, an attorney of BuyerÂ’s own
selection in connection with this transaction, and such attorney was not
directly or indirectly identified, suggested, or selected by Seller or an
agent of Seller.

 

Section 17.3. _Parties Bear Own Expenses/No Special Damages_. Each party shall
bear and pay all expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees)
incurred by it in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY NEITHER PARTY SHALL
HAVE ANY OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR OTHERWISE IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH, FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES. For purposes of the foregoing, actual damages may, however,
include indirect, special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages to
the extent (i) the injuries or losses resulting in or giving rise to such
damages are incurred or suffered by a Person which is not an Indemnitee
pursuant to the Agreement or an Affiliate of such Indemnitee and (ii) such
damages are recovered against an Indemnitee by a Person which is not
Indemnitee or an Affiliate of such Indemnitee. This Section shall operate only
to limit a partyÂ’s liability and shall not operate to increase or expand any
contractual obligation of a party hereunder or cause any contractual
obligation of a party hereunder to survive longer than provided in Section
13.3.

 

Section 17.4. _Transfer Taxes_. If this transaction is deemed to be subject to
Transfer Tax, for any reason, Seller and Buyer agree to be responsible for
such Transfer Taxes on a 50%/50% basis. Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate
with each other in demonstrating that the requirements for exemptions, if any,
from such Transfer Taxes have been met.

 

Section 17.5. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement including the Exhibits and
Schedules attached hereto contains the entire understanding of the parties
hereto with respect to subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions among the parties
with respect to such subject matter.

 

Section 17.6. _Choice of Law, etc_.Without regard to principles of conflicts
of law, this Agreement, and all claims of causes of action (whether in
contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement
or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall be construed and
enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Texas
applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such state
and the laws of the United States of America, except that, to the extent that
the law of

 



61  a state in which a portion of the Properties is located (or which is
otherwise applicable to a portion of the Properties) necessarily governs, the
law of such state shall apply as to that portion of the property located in
(or otherwise subject to the laws of) such state. EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 17.7. _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

Section 17.8. _No Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding on and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, provided that neither party shall have the right to assign this
Agreement, including any indemnification rights, or any obligations or
benefits hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other party
first having been obtained, except that Buyer may assign any or all of its
rights and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate of Buyer that is a Delaware
limited liability company. Any transfer in absence of such consent shall be
null and void.

Section 17.9. _Counterpart Execution_. For execution, this Agreement may be
executed in counterparts, all of which are identical and all of which
constitute one and the same instrument. It shall not be necessary for Buyer,
Seller and the Companies to sign the same counterpart. This instrument may be
validly executed and delivered by facsimile or other electronic transmission.

Section 17.10. _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) THE PARTIES HERETO HAVE VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO DEFINE THEIR RIGHTS,
LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS RESPECTING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT
EXCLUSIVELY IN CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THE EXPRESS TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULES HERETO; AND, WITHOUT LIMITING THE

FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP OR DUTY EXISTS. THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY
BREACH OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS

 



62  AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH HEREIN)

ONLY (AS SUCH CONTRACTUAL REMEDIES MAY BE FURTHER LIMITED OR EXCLUDED
PURSUANT TO THE EXPRESS TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT); AND, WITHOUT LIMITING THE
RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO RELY ON THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE TO SUCH
PARTY IN ARTICLE III, ARTICLE IV AND ARTICLE VI HEREIN, THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM RELIANCE ON THE OTHER PARTY AND CLEARLY AND
UNEQUIVOCALLY WAIVE AND RELEASE ANY AND ALL TORT CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION
THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY TORT
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.
WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF BUYER
FOR ANY AND ALL (A) CLAIMS RELATING TO ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES,
COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, (B) OTHER CLAIMS
PURSUANT TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND (C) OTHER CLAIMS
RELATING TO THE PROPERTIES AND THE PURCHASE AND SALE THEREOF SHALL BE ANY
RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION FROM SUCH CLAIMS THAT IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, AND IF NO SUCH RIGHT OF INDEMNIFICATION IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED, THEN
SUCH CLAIMS ARE HEREBY WAIVED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. EACH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS THIS AGREEMENT AND ITS CONTENTS, AND SIGNS THIS AGREEMENT AS
ITS OWN FREE ACT. EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY WARRANTS THAT IT HAS BEEN REPRESENTED
BY LEGAL COUNSEL IN THIS MATTER, AND LEGAL COUNSEL HAS READ AND EXPLAINED TO
EACH PARTY THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND ITS WAIVERS AND RELEASES
IN FULL. EACH PARTY COVENANTS NOT TO SUE ON CLAIMS RELEASED OR WAIVED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH SUIT SHALL BE A BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT
FOR WHICH THE NONBREACHING PARTY MAY SEEK ACTUAL DAMAGES, WHICH SHALL INCLUDE
ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING OR ANY OTHER PROVISION
HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, THIS DISCLAIMER SHALL NOT RESTRICT AND LIMIT ANY
CLAIM BASED ON FRAUD BY THE OTHER PARTY.

(b) UPON CLOSING, BUYER SHALL WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT ALSO BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT TO CONTRIBUTION AGAINST SELLER

Purchase and Sale Agreement EXHIBIT 2.2

Earnout Payment



   1. | _Earnout_. If the Aggregate Average Volume during any Measurement
Period included in the Earnout Period equals or exceeds the Base Case Volume
for such Measurement Period, Buyer shall pay or cause the Companies to pay to
Seller the Earnout Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account designated by Seller, within ten (10) Business Days after the
related Earnout Payment Certificate becomes final in accordance with Section
4 of this Exhibit 2.2. Once paid, the Earnout Amount shall be non-refundable,
and the financial condition and results of operations of the Companies during
and following the Earnout Period shall not affect SellerÂ’s right to receive
and retain the Earnout Amount. 
---|--- 

If the Aggregate Average Volume never equals or exceeds the Base Case Volume
during any Measurement Period within the Earnout Period, then upon expiration
of the Earnout Period, all obligations of the Buyer and the Companies with
respect to the Earnout Amount shall lapse and terminate. 



   2. | _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used in this Exhibit 2.2 and not
otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement.
When used in this Exhibit 2.2 or in any other provision of the Agreement, the
following terms shall have the respective meanings assigned to them below: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | "Aggregate Average Volume" means the sum of all Inlet
Volumes of crude oil during any Measurement Period divided by the number of
days in the Measurement Period. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | "Base Case Volume" means the base case "initial volume" for
a particular Measurement Period as shown on _Annex 2.5.1_ hereto.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | "Designated Area" means the counties listed on _Annex
2.5.2_. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | "Earnout Period" means the period commencing on the Closing
Date and ending on June 30, 2014. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | "Inlet Volumes" means all quantities of crude oil received
by the Companies at the receipt points on the Pipeline as same is physically
extended and expanded during the Earnout Period. For the avoidance of doubt,
Inlet Volumes shall include all volumes of crude oil actually available from
and offered by producers to Companies at the receipt points on the Pipeline
within the Designated Area, but that were not received by the Companies due
to a breach by Buyer or a Company (other than due to a force majeure event) of
a contractual obligation, provided such volumes will not be double counted for
backhauls, extensions or other.  
---|---|--- Earnout Period. 
---|---|--- 
 



   3. | _Operation of Companies_. During the Earnout Period, 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The Companies shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Companies
to, conduct the activities and operations of the Companies and the Properties
in the ordinary course of business of the Companies. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Neither Company shall enter into any transaction or
arrangement with the Buyer or any of its Affiliates that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the calculation of any Aggregate Average Volume. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall not enter into any transaction or
arrangement within the Designated Area that competes with the Companies
for crude oil volumes within the Designated Area, to the extent such
competition could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the calculation
of any Aggregate Average Volume, except that Buyer may acquire other existing
midstream assets and businesses and in such case, if Seller in good faith
determines that such acquisition adversely influences the SellerÂ’s ability to
obtain the Earnout Amount, then Seller may suggest an appropriate adjustment
to the Base Case Volume. If an adjustment cannot be mutually agreed upon,
then either Seller or Buyer may submit the issue of whether an adjustment is
required and the appropriate amount of such adjustment to the Independent
Expert. No later than the sixtieth (60th) day after its appointment, the
Independent Expert shall send its written determination of the appropriate
adjustment to the Base Case Volume to Buyer and Seller and such determination
of the Independent Expert shall be final and binding on the parties, absent
fraud or manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert
shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. 

---|---|--- 



   4. | _Determination of Aggregate Average Volume_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | On or before thirty (30) days after the end of each
Measurement Period, Buyer shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared
and delivered, to Seller a certificate signed by the chief financial officer,
chief accounting officer or any other vice president of finance of Buyer (each
an "Earnout Payment Certificate") setting forth BuyerÂ’s calculation of the
Aggregate Average Volume for the Companies for such Measurement Period
together with a worksheet showing in reasonable detail the calculation of such
amount and copies of back-up and other supporting information that reasonably
supports such calculation.  
---|---|--- Buyer shall assist Seller in its review of the Earnout Payment Certificate by
providing Seller with any data or information within BuyerÂ’s control that is
reasonably requested by Seller, and by providing Seller with reasonable access
to management of the Companies. The Earnout Payment Certificate shall become
final and binding upon the parties on the thirtieth (30th) day following
receipt thereof by Seller, unless Seller gives written notice of a Dispute
based on its disagreement with the Earnout Payment Certificate to Buyer prior
to such date. In order to be valid, any such Dispute notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature and basis of any disagreement so asserted based
on SellerÂ’s Knowledge. 

---|---|--- 



   5. | _Dispute Regarding Earnout Payment Certificate_. If Buyer and
Seller cannot agree upon any Earnout Payment Certificate, the Dispute shall be
submitted to the Independent Expert, which firm shall make a final and
binding determination as to all matters in dispute relating to the
calculations set forth in the Earnout Payment Certificate as promptly as
practicable after its appointment, but in no event later than the thirtieth
(30th) day after its appointment. The Independent Expert shall send its
written determination of the calculation provided for in this Exhibit 2.2 to
Buyer and Seller and such determination of the Independent Expert shall be
final and binding on the parties, absent fraud or manifest error. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.
