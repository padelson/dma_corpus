WHEREAS, Parent, the Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger;

 

 AGREEMENT 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1.

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days) after the date hereof, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the
Purchaser to) commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), the Offer to purchase all the outstanding
Common Shares at the Common Offer Price and all the outstanding Preferred
Shares at the Preferred Offer Price. The obligation of the Purchaser to
commence the Offer shall be subject only to the condition that none of the
events set forth in clauses (c)(i) through (c)(iv) of Annex I hereto
shall have occurred and be continuing (and not waived by Parent or the
Purchaser in their sole discretion), and the obligation of the Purchaser to
accept for payment, purchase and pay for Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to: (i) there being
validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the
Expiration Date that number of Shares which, together with the number of
Shares (if any) then owned of record by Parent or the Purchaser or with
respect to which Parent or the Purchaser otherwise has, directly or
indirectly, sole voting power, represents at least a majority of the Common
Shares then outstanding (determined on a Fully Diluted Basis) (the "
_Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or the
Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I.

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction,
or waiver by Parent or the Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements
set forth in Annex I, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the
Purchaser to) accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable after
Purchaser is legally permitted to do so under applicable Law. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Acceptance Time shall not occur (and Purchaser
may not accept for payment any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer) prior to
the Initial Expiration Date or if the Minimum Condition is not satisfied. The
Common Offer Price and Preferred Offer Price payable in respect of each
Common Share and Preferred Share, respectively, validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller in
cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I. Parent and the Purchaser
expressly reserve the right to increase the Common Offer Price and the
Preferred Offer Price in proportion to each other or to make any other changes
in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that
unless otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or as previously approved by
the Company in writing, the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Common Offer
Price or the Preferred Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares to be
purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum Condition, (v) amend
or modify any term, condition or requirement of the Offer in a manner adverse
to the holders of Shares, (vi) add any additional condition to the Offer or
(vii) extend or change the Expiration Date in a manner other than in
accordance with this Agreement.

 

(d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer
shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date that is twenty (20)
Business Days following the commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial
Expiration Date_ ") or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in
accordance with 

 



2  this Agreement, the date on which the Offer has been so extended (the
Initial Expiration Date, or such later date to which the Initial Expiration
Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration
Date_ ").

(e) If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, all of the
conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I) have not been satisfied, or
waived by Parent or the Purchaser, the Purchaser may, and, if requested by the
Company, shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) extend the Offer for
successive periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each, the length of each
such period to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion, in order to
permit the satisfaction of such conditions; _provided_ , however, that
neither Parent nor the Purchaser shall be required to extend the Offer (i)
beyond April 22, 2011 (the " _Outside Date_ "), (ii) if either of the
conditions set forth in clause (c)(iii) or (c)(iv) of Annex I are not at such
time satisfied in accordance with this Agreement (other than any such
conditions that are not so satisfied or waived under circumstances in which
the breach or breaches preventing such conditions from being satisfied may,
by their nature, be cured by the Company through the exercise of its
reasonable efforts for a period not greater than forty-five (45) days, in
which case the Company may (if all other conditions set forth in
clauses (c)(iii) and (c)(iv) of Annex I are satisfied) request one or more
extensions of the Offer pursuant to this sentence for up to forty-five (45)
days in the aggregate) or (iii) after the Company delivers or is required to
deliver to Parent a notice with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that has
been received by the Company in accordance with _Section 5.4(c)_, except to
the extent that (A) prior to the expiration of the Offer the Acquisition
Proposal giving rise to such notice has been withdrawn or the Company Board
has rejected the Acquisition Proposal giving rise to such notice and, in each
case, the Company Board has reconfirmed the Company Board Recommendation and
the withdrawal or rejection of such Acquisition Proposal, and the
reconfirmation of the Company Board Recommendation has been publicly announced
by the Company or (B) less than three (3) Business Days have elapsed since the
Company has received such Acquisition Proposal and there has not been a
Change of Board Recommendation. In addition, the Purchaser shall extend the
Offer (i) for any period or periods required by applicable Law or applicable
rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff or (ii) following
Parents receipt of written notice from the Company within the three (3)
Business Day period immediately preceding (and including) the Expiration
Date advising Parent that the Company Board intends to make a Change of Board
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.4(d)_,
until (and including) the third (3rd) Business Day following the date of such
receipt. 

(f) If necessary to obtain sufficient Common Shares and Preferred Shares to
reach the Short Form Threshold (without regard to the exercise of the Top-Up
Option), the Purchaser may, and, if requested by the Company, shall (and shall
cause the Purchaser to), provide for a "subsequent offering period" in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act of at least three (3)
Business Days. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Offer, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to)
immediately accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares that are validly
tendered pursuant to the Offer during such "subsequent offering period". The
Offer Documents will provide for the possibility of a "subsequent offering
period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this  _Section 1.1(f)_.

(g) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article 7_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article 7_ , the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause the Purchaser to) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by the Purchaser, or this Agreement is
terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, the Purchaser shall
promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of the
Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to
the registered holders thereof.

 

(h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule
14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto,

 



3  the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the
Offer to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal and a form of summary
advertisement (collectively, together with any amendments and supplements
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and the Purchaser agree to cause
the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the
extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and the Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and Parent and the
Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed
with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer
Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and the Purchaser
shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent
and the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any
written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that Parent,
the Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly
after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any
such written responses and Parent and the Purchaser shall give due
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel.

 

1.2 _Company Actions_.

(a) Contemporaneous with the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall, in
a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the
SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall, subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.4(d)_, contain the Company Board Recommendation.
The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents
from the Company Financial Advisor to permit the Company to include in the
Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, the Fairness Opinion, and upon receipt of
such consent, shall so include the Fairness Opinion in the Schedule 14D-9. The
Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a
description of the Company Board Recommendation. The Company further agrees to
cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to
the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect
or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to cause
the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed
with the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and
their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, the Purchaser
and their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them
of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto.
Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any such written responses and the Company shall give
due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel.

(b) Promptly after the date hereof and otherwise from time to time as
requested by the Purchaser or its agents, the Company shall furnish or cause
to be furnished to the Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings,
non-objecting Beneficial Owner lists and any other listings or computer files
containing the names and addresses of the record or beneficial holders of the
Shares as of the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish
Purchaser with such information (including, but not limited to, updated lists
of holders of the Shares and their addresses, mailing labels, security
position listings and non-objecting

 



4  Beneficial Owner lists) and such other assistance as the Purchaser or its
agents may reasonably request in communicating with the record and beneficial
holders of Shares. In addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company
shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any third parties
to, cooperate with Parent and the Purchaser to disseminate the Offer Documents
to holders of Common Shares held in or subject to any Company Stock Plan or
other Company Benefit Plan, and to permit such holders of Common Shares to
tender Common Shares in the Offer.

1.3 _Directors_.

(a) After the Purchaser accepts for payment Shares tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement (the " _Acceptance Time_
"), and at all times thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to elect or
designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Company Board as is equal to the product of the total number of directors
on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by
Parent pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that
the aggregate number of Common Shares Beneficially Owned by Parent, the
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates bears to the total number of
Common Shares then outstanding (including, in each case, any outstanding
securities of the Company that are convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Common Shares on an as-converted basis). After the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall, upon Parents request, take all actions as are
necessary or desirable to enable Parents designees to be so elected or
designated to the Company Board, including but not limited to promptly filling
vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company Board, promptly
increasing the size of the Company Board (including by amending the Company
Bylaws if necessary to increase the size of the Company Board) and/or promptly
securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors, and shall
cause Parents designees to be so elected or designated at such time.
After the Acceptance Time, the Company shall also, upon Parents request,
cause the directors elected or designated by Parent to the Company Board to
serve on and constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole
number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company
Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company
Subsidiary and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in

proposed designees to the Company Board required by Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1.

(c) After Parents designees are elected or designated to, and constitute a
majority of, the Company Board pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_, and prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board to maintain at least
three directors who are members of the Company Board on the date hereof (the

_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the

shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or such other date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger, such date and time herein referred to
as the " _Effective Time_ ".

1.6 _Written Consent of Stockholders to Approve the Merger_. After the
Acceptance Time and, if applicable, the completion of the subsequent offering
period contemplated in _Section 1.1(f)_, if approval of the stockholders of
the Company is required under applicable Law to consummate the Merger, the

required of it under this _Section 1.6_.

(a) The Company shall prepare an information statement with respect to the
Stockholder Consent (together with any amendments and supplements thereto and
any other required materials, the " _Information Statement_ "). Parent, the
Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
the Information Statement before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company
shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel. The Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Information
Statement, if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the
Company agrees to cause the Information Statement, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and, if any such correction is made following the mailing
of the Information Statement, mailed to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall provide Parent,
the Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written comments, and
shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Information Statement promptly after the Companys receipt of such comments,
and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent, the Purchaser and their
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written
responses and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, the Purchaser
and their counsel.

(b) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
and subject to the requirements of applicable Law: (i) as promptly as
practicable after the Acceptance Time, in consultation with Parent, duly set a
record date for an action by written consent of the stockholders of the
Company (the " _Stockholder Consent_ ") for the purpose of adopting this
Agreement (with the record date to be set in consultation with Parent for a
date after the Acceptance Time); (ii) as promptly as practicable after the
execution and delivery of the Stockholder Consent, file the Information
Statement with the SEC and cause the Information Statement to be printed and
mailed to the stockholders of the Company and (iii) as promptly as practicable
after the Company is legally permitted to do so under applicable Law,
consummate the actions approved in the Stockholder Consent.

(c) Parent and Purchaser shall execute, or cause to be executed, the
Stockholder Consent with respect to all of the Shares then owned of record by
Parent and the Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or the Purchaser
otherwise has, directly or indirectly, sole voting power. The parties hereto
agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to
become effective as promptly as practicable in accordance with Section 251 of
the DGCL.

 



7 1.7 _Short Form Merger_. Notwithstanding the terms of _Section 1.6_, if
after the Acceptance Time and, if applicable, the expiration of any
"subsequent offering period" provided by the Purchaser in accordance with this
Agreement and the exercise of the Top-Up Option, Parent and the Purchaser
shall then hold of record, in the aggregate, at least 90% of the outstanding
shares of each class of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote on the
adoption of this Agreement under applicable Law (the " _Short Form Threshold_
"), the parties hereto agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to
cause the Merger to become effective as promptly as practicable without the
vote or consent of the stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section
253 of the DGCL.

1.8 _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Common Offer
Price an aggregate number of Common Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ")
equal to the lowest number of Common Shares that, when added to the number of
Common Shares owned by Parent, the Purchaser or their Affiliates at the time
of such exercise, shall constitute one share more than ninety percent (90%) of
the total Common Shares then outstanding on a Fully Diluted Basis (and
assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless, immediately after such
exercise and the issuance of Common Shares pursuant thereto, the Short Form
Threshold would be reached (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares); _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be
exercisable for a number of Common Shares in excess of the Companys total
authorized and unissued Common Shares. Upon Parents request, the Company
shall cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to Parent the number of
Common Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise
of the Top-Up Option and after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares.

(b) Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid
for the Top-Up Option Shares by delivery of either (i) cash for the full
purchase price of the Top-Up Option Shares or (ii) (x) cash in an amount equal
to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and (y)
a promissory note (the " _Promissory Note_ ") with a principal amount equal to
the full purchase price of the Top-Up Option Shares less the amount of cash
paid pursuant to immediately preceding clause (x), bearing simple interest at
6% per annum, and due 60 Business Days after the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares.

(c) Provided that no applicable Law or regulation shall prohibit the exercise
of the Top-Up Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant
thereto, or otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, the Purchaser
may exercise the Top-Up Option on one or more occasions, in whole or in part,
after the Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the
Effective Time and (ii) the valid termination of this Agreement. 

(d) Each time that the Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, the
Purchaser shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise
Notice_ ") specifying the denominations of the certificate or certificates
evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares that the Purchaser wishes to receive, and
the place, time and date for the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to
the Top-Up Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly
after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to the
Purchaser confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate
purchase price therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up
Closing, the Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to
be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares in accordance with  _Section 1.8(b)_
and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to the Purchaser a
certificate or certificates representing the Top-Up Option Shares or, at the
Purchasers request or otherwise if the Company does not then
have certificated Common Shares, the applicable number of Book-Entry Shares.
Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any legends that are
required by applicable Law.

 



8 ARTICLE 2. 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Common Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Common Shares
to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ and other than Dissenting
Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive the Common Offer Price
(the " _Common Consideration_ "), payable net to the holder in cash, without
interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in
accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_, upon surrender of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing such Common Shares in accordance
with _Section 2.2_.

(b)  _Conversion of Company Preferred Stock_. Each Preferred Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, other than
Preferred Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ and
other than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive
the Preferred Offer Price (the " _Preferred Consideration_ " and together with
the Common Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable net to
the holder in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_, upon
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing such
Preferred Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

(c) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company
Subsidiary, and all Shares owned of record by Parent, the Purchaser or any of
their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

(d) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent for purposes of
effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration in connection with the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent or the Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares
shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement, together
with the aggregate Warrant Payments. Such funds shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent, in its sole discretion, pending payment
thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings from such
investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and no part of
such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case, which Shares were converted into the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration at the Effective Time
pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of
a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such

 



9  Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share. Any Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of any Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the applicable Merger Consideration to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.
Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated
by this Agreement, without interest thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following six months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent
and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in
accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_. If, prior to six years after the Effective
Time (or otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any payment in
respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws), any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has not complied with
the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_ to receive payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the
payment in respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for any Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. 

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the relevant Common Offer Price, Preferred Offer Price, Merger
Consideration, Option Payment, Warrant Payment or other consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company
Options or Company Warrants, as applicable, such amounts that Parent, the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable
Law, including with respect to stock transfer Taxes payable by the seller. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon

 



10  the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, and, if
reasonably required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such holder
of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by the
Paying Agent or Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Paying Agent or Parent with respect to such Certificates, the applicable
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to  _Section
2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.1(b)_ hereof.

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for
such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, and shall instead represent the right to receive payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to the extent
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262
of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into
and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and to control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands,
or agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and
agree that in any appraisal proceeding under Section 262 of the DGCL with
respect to Dissenting Shares and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, the Surviving Corporation shall not assert that the Top-Up Option, the
Top-Up Option Shares or any cash or Promissory Note delivered by Purchaser to
the Company as payment for any Top-Up Option Shares should be considered in
connection with the determination of the fair value of the Dissenting
Shares in accordance with Section 262(h) of the DGCL.

2.4 _Treatment of Company Options; Restricted Stock; Stock Plans_. 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) the vesting and
exercisability of each then unexpired and unexercised option or similar
rights to purchase Company Common Stock (the " _Company Options_ "), granted
under any stock option plan of the Company, including the Clarient, Inc. 2007
Incentive Award Plan, the Chromavision Medical Systems, Inc. 1996 Equity
Compensation Plan, as amended from time to time, or any other plan, agreement
or arrangement (collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), held by any
Person who is, to the extent required by the terms of the applicable Company
Stock Plan or award agreement, then performing services as an employee,
director or consultant of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be fully accelerated, (ii) each Company Option with an exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Common
Offer Price, without regard to the identity of the holder, shall be cancelled
and terminated, and (iii) each Company Option with an exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock that is less than the Common Offer Price, without
regard to the identity of the holder, shall be deemed exercised and, at the
Effective Time, shall be terminated and converted into the right to receive an
amount (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by
applicable Law to be withheld in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_) equal to
the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock deemed
to be issued upon the deemed exercise of such Company Option and (B) the
excess, if any, of the Common Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Company Option (such
amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Option Payments_ ").
From and after the Effective Time, any such deemed exercised

 



11  Company Option shall only entitle such holder to the payment of the Option
Payments. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all necessary
action under the Company Stock Plans and the stock option agreements
evidencing the Company Options (including, to the extent necessary, obtaining
consent of the holders of the Company Options) to effectuate the actions
contemplated by this _Section 2.4(a)_.

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) the vesting of all
restricted shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Restricted Stock_ ") that
are then unvested and awarded under the Company Stock Plans held by any Person
who is, to the extent required by the terms of the applicable Company Stock
Plan or award agreement, then performing services as an employee, director or
consultant of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
fully accelerated, and (ii) each then outstanding share of Restricted Stock
shall be automatically converted into the right to receive the Common
Consideration on the terms and conditions set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_,
subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance
with _Section 2.2(e)_. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall take all necessary action under the Company Stock Plans and the
restricted stock award agreements evidencing the Restricted Stock (including,
to the extent necessary, obtaining consent of the holders of the Restricted
Stock) to effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section 2.4(b)_.

(c) _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. After the Effective Time, all
Company Stock Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options or
other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder.

2.5 _Treatment of Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase
Common Shares that is issued, unexpired and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Company Warrants_ ") and not terminated pursuant
to its terms in connection with the Merger shall be entitled to receive upon
the exercise of such Company Warrant a payment in cash (subject to any
applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law to be
withheld in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_) of an amount equal to the
product of (i) the total number of Common Shares previously subject to such
Company Warrant and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Common Consideration over
the exercise price per Common Share previously subject to such Company Warrant
(such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Warrant Payments_
"). From and after the Effective Time, any such Company Warrant shall no
longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof for any Common Shares or
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, but shall only entitle such holder
to the payment of the Warrant Payment upon exercise of such Company
Warrant. The Company shall give any necessary notices required under the
Company Warrants that are required to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to the notice
contemplated in this _Section 5.4(d)_ or otherwise; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (y) unless in advance of or concurrently with such termination the
Company pays the Breakup Fee; and

(ii) except with respect to or in connection with any Acquisition Proposal
(which is covered by _Section 5.4(d)(i)_), if the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such action is
necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law, the Company Board may at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time effect a Change of Board Recommendation.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board has
reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.

5.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

(a) The Company, Parent and Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts
to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to

otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental
Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations

and filing the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9, the Information Statement
and any Other Filings, (y) determining whether any action by or in respect of,
or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required, in connection with the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger and (z) seeking any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings. The Company, Parent
and Purchaser shall furnish to each other all information about such
party required for any application or other filing under the rules and
regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



35 (b) The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and instruct CPS to give) any notices to third parties, and use,
and cause their respective Subsidiaries or instruct CPS to use, their
reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party consents, (i) necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule,
or (iii) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring
prior to or after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ that the Company
and Parent shall coordinate and cooperate in determining whether any actions,
consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to
any Company Material Contracts in connection with consummation of the Offer or
the Merger and seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.5_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of
the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties reasonably informed as to the status of
any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding; and
(iii) promptly inform the other parties of any material communication to or
from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Entity regarding the Offer or the Merger. Each party hereto will
consult and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith
the views of the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with
respect to the Offer or the Merger, (i) without the prior written consent of
Parent, none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or CPS shall pay or commit
to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash
or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligation due to such Person, and (ii) neither Parent nor the Purchaser shall
be required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent
is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or
incur any liability or other obligation.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with the receipt of any necessary approvals or clearances of a Governmental
Entity (including under the HSR Act), neither Parent nor the Company (nor any
of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates) shall be required to sell,
hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their business in a specified
manner, or agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct
their businesses in a specified manner, or enter into or agree to enter into a
voting trust arrangement, proxy arrangement, "hold separate" agreement or
arrangement or similar agreement or arrangement with respect to the
assets, operations or conduct of their business in a specified manner, or
permit the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any assets of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

 

5.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party
hereto of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would be
likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the
Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not
to be satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not cure any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice. 

5.7 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and the Purchaser
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or

 



36  delayed), except (x) as such release or announcement may be required by
applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant
party is subject, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance, or (y) in respect of any Acquisition Proposal, any such release or
announcement by Parent or, so long as the Company has complied with _Section
5.4_, the Company. The Company, Parent and the Purchaser agree that the press
release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a
joint release of, and shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of,
the Company and Parent.

 

5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) For a period of at least one year following the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide to each employee of the Company, CPS and each Company Subsidiary
who continues to be employed by Parent, CPS or the Surviving Corporation (or
any Subsidiary thereof) (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") total compensation
(including employee benefits other than equity based compensation and
retention benefits and based on bonus opportunity rather than actual bonus
payments) that is at least substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
compensation provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement.

 

(b) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
and instruct CPS to assume the liability for such accrued personal, sick or
vacation time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal,
sick or vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies of Parent,
CPS or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable.

 

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plan, program, policy and arrangement
maintained by Parent, CPS or the Surviving Corporation (or any Subsidiary
thereof) (collectively, the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") in which any
Continuing Employee may participate effective as of the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to and instruct CPS to, take
such actions as are necessary to recognize all service of the Continuing
Employees with the Company, CPS or a Company Subsidiary, as the case may be,
for purposes of (i) vesting and eligibility and (ii) level of benefits (for
purposes of vacation, severance and other service-based benefits, but not for
purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan), to the
same extent and for the same purposes that such service was recognized under
a corresponding Company Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such credit shall be required to the extent that it would
result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, take such
actions as are necessary to cause the group health plan maintained by Parent,
CPS or the Surviving Corporation (or any Subsidiary thereof), to the extent
such group health plan is made available to the Continuing Employees after the
Effective Time, to (i) waive any evidence of insurability requirements,
waiting periods, and any limitations as to preexisting medical conditions
under the group health plan applicable to the Continuing Employees and their
spouses and eligible dependents (but only to the extent that such preexisting
condition limitations did not apply or were satisfied under the applicable
Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) provide the
Continuing Employees with credit, for the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs, for the amount of any out-of pocket expenses or deductible
expenses that were covered by the applicable medical or dental Company Benefit
Plan and are incurred by them during the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs under a group medical or dental plan maintained by Parent, CPS or
the Surviving Corporation (or any Subsidiary thereof).

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay the amount
of bonus that may become payable to eligible employees of the Company, CPS and
each Company Subsidiary under the terms of the Companys Management Incentive
Plan and Employee Incentive Program for the fiscal year ending December 31,
2010.

 



37 (f) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third-party beneficiary
or other rights in any Continuing Employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of any benefits that may be
provided, directly or indirectly, under any Parent Benefit Plan for
Continuing Employees. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 5.8_ shall impede or limit the Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from (x)
terminating any of their employees at any time for any reason or no reason,
subject to the provisions of applicable Law, or (y) amending or terminating
any Company Benefit Plan or any Parent Benefit Plan following the Effective
Time.

5.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors and officers
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each a " _Covered Person_ ") from
and against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A)
any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Covered Persons
capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary occurring (or, in the case of an omission, that allegedly should
have occurred) at or prior to the Effective Time, or (B) this Agreement, the
Merger, the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Support Agreements or any of the
other transactions contemplated herein. Parent shall advance or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to advance to each Covered Person any expenses
(including expenses incurred to enforce the provisions of this _Section
5.9(a)_) actually and reasonably incurred in defending any claims, actions,
suits, proceedings or investigations with respect to the matters subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.9(a)_ upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Covered Person to repay such amount if it
shall ultimately be determined by a final and non-appealable judgment issued
by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Covered Person is not entitled
to be indemnified pursuant to this _Section 5.9(a)_, and such determination
shall be made independently of the outcome of any determination made with
respect to the underlying claim, action, suit proceeding or investigation.

(b) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle or compromise
or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with
respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation against a
Covered Person for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section
5.9_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of such Covered Person from all liability arising out of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the
Company for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set
forth in the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws. The indemnification
agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement with any of the
directors, officers or employees of the Company shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

(d) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain for the benefit of the Companys directors and
officers, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the Companys existing policy (true and complete copies which
have been previously provided to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an
annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (such 300% amount, the "
_Base Premium_ ");  _provided_ , _further_ , that if such insurance coverage
can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Base Premium, the
Surviving Corporation shall

 



38  maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and officers
insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Base Premium. The
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time,
which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an
aggregate period of six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such
policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder.

(e) In the event the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

(f) The obligations under this _Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this
_Section 5.9_ applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it
being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.9_
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_).

5.10 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition", "fair price",
"business combination" or other anti-takeover Laws becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent or the Purchaser, the Offer, the Merger or
the Top-Up Option, including the acquisition of Common Shares pursuant
thereto, or the Support Agreements or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, then the Company Board shall take all action necessary to
render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

5.11 _Parent Agreement Concerning Purchaser and Adoption of this Agreement_.
Parent agrees to cause the Purchaser to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement. Parent shall cause to be executed and delivered the documentation
necessary to adopt this Agreement, in its capacity as the indirect
controlling parent of the Purchaser, within twenty four (24) hours of its
execution of this Agreement.

5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered Person
of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ") of Company Options pursuant to
this Agreement or Common Shares pursuant to the Merger shall be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

5.13 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
(acting through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board) will take all
such steps as may be required to cause each agreement, arrangement or
understanding entered into by the Company, CPS or the Company Subsidiaries on
or after the date hereof with any of its officers, directors or employees
pursuant to which consideration is paid to such officer, director or employee
to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee
benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the
Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

5.14 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

5.15  _Transfer Taxes_. Parent shall pay all applicable sales, use, stock
transfer, stamp or other similar transfer Taxes that are, or become, due or
payable by the Company as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby.

7.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Parent as provided in _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, the
Purchaser, CPS or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, officers or
directors except (i) with respect to _Section 5.3(b)_, _Section 5.7_, this
_Section 7.2_ and  _Article 8_ and (ii) with respect to any liabilities or
damages incurred or suffered by a party as a result of the willful and
material breach by another party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to  _Section 7.1(e)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent, immediately
prior to such termination, a termination fee of eighteen million dollars
($18,000,000) (the " _Breakup Fee_ "). In the event that this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_, then the Company shall
pay the Breakup Fee to Parent within two (2) Business Days after such
termination.

 



41 (c) In the event that: (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(f)_, (ii) prior to the date of termination of this
Agreement an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed
and (iii) any Acquisition Proposal is consummated, or any agreement providing
for an Acquisition Proposal is entered into by the Company, CPS or any Company
Subsidiary, within six (6) months of the termination of this Agreement, then
in such event, the Company shall pay Parent the Breakup Fee no later than two
days after the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that for
purposes of this _Section 7.2(c)_, the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 8.4_, except that the
references to "15%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

 

(d) All payments under this _Section 7.2_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. In
no event shall the Breakup Fee be paid more than once.

(e) Each of the Company, Parent and the Purchaser acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements,
Parent, the Purchaser and the Company would not enter into this Agreement and
(iii) the Breakup Fee is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent and the Purchaser in the circumstances in which such
Breakup Fee is payable. 

(f) Notwithstanding _Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section 7.2(d)_, in the event that
this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ (so
long as an Acquisition Proposal has not been publicly announced and not
withdrawn prior to such termination) or _Section 7.1(d)(iii)_ and the Company
does not, at such time, have cash on hand or availability under committed
credit facilities sufficient to pay the Breakup Fee in full, then the Company
may, at its option, pay to Parent (A) within two (2) Business Days after such
termination, a portion of the Breakup Fee equal to at least $12,000,000 in
cash, and (B) within forty-five (45) days after such termination, an amount
equal to the remaining amount of the Breakup Fee (the " _Deferred Payment_ ")
plus interest on the Deferred Payment accruing at a rate of 15% per annum,
compounded monthly, during such forty-five (45) day period. If the Company
fails to repay in full the Deferred Payment, together with any accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, within such forty-five (45) day period, interest
will accrue on the unpaid amount at a rate of 20% per annum, compounded
monthly, thereafter until paid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon
the earlier of (i) the consummation of a Qualified Financing Transaction,
(ii) the consummation of a transaction effecting an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) recommendation of an Alternative Proposal by the Company Board or (iv)
the Companys entry into an agreement providing for an Alternative Proposal,
the Deferred Payment, together with all accrued and unpaid interest at such
time, shall immediately become due and payable by the Company to Parent.

 

7.3 _Amendment_. Subject to _Section 1.3(c)_, this Agreement may be amended
by the Company, Parent and the Purchaser, whether before or after the
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company (by action taken
by or on behalf of the Company Board in the case of the Company) at any time
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after adoption of
this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, no amendment may be made which,
by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange,

50 8.6 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Company Disclosure
Schedules and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and
supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and,
except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended to confer upon
any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.

 

8.9 _Assignment_. The Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by
operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties, _provided_ that Parent or the Purchaser may assign any of their
respective rights and obligations to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of
Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or the Purchaser, as
the case may be, of its obligations hereunder.

8.10 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
other than pursuant to _Section 5.9_, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.

8.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
include masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words
"include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be
terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all references in
this Agreement to "Sections," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to refer
to Sections of this Agreement and Annexes and Schedules to this Agreement.
All references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars.
Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be
deemed to be exclusive.

 

8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

 

(a) The Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and all disputes between the parties under or related to this
Agreement or the facts and circumstances leading to its execution, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to laws that may be
applicable under conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware
State court, or Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising 

 



51  out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in
connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any
such action or proceeding except in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (provided that, in the event that subject matter jurisdiction is
unavailable in that court, then any such action or proceeding shall be
commenced exclusively in any other Delaware State court, or Federal court of
the United States of America, sitting in Delaware), (ii) agrees that any
claim in respect of any such action or proceeding shall be heard and
determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(provided that, in the event that subject matter jurisdiction is unavailable
in that court, then all such claims shall be heard and determined exclusively
in any other Delaware State court, or Federal court of the United States of
America, sitting in Delaware), (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or any other Delaware State court, or
Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in Delaware, in
the event that subject matter jurisdiction is unavailable in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware), and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding in any of said courts. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in _Section 8.3_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH
WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 8.12(c).

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and by
the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

8.15 _Non-Recourse_. Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that are
expressly named as parties hereto, and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein. No former, current or future direct or indirect
equity holders, Controlling Persons, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general

 



52  or limited partners or assignees of the Company, Parent or the Purchaser or
any of their respective Affiliates shall have any liability or obligation for
any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or
liabilities of the Company, Parent or the Purchaser under this Agreement or of
or for any action, suit, arbitration, claim, litigation, investigation, or
proceeding based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the breach, termination or failure to
consummate such transactions), in each case whether based on Contract, tort,
strict liability, other Laws or otherwise and whether by piercing the
corporate veil, by a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or another
Person or otherwise.

 



53 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, the Purchaser and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer and in addition to the

the provisions of the Merger Agreement and applicable Law, the Purchaser shall
not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange

payment of or, subject to the restrictions referred to above, the payment
for, any validly tendered Shares, if (a) the Minimum Condition shall not have
been satisfied at the Expiration Date, (b) any waiting period or approval

Entity of competent jurisdiction against Parent, the Purchaser, the Company,

prohibit the acquisition by Parent or the Purchaser of any Shares pursuant to
the Offer or restrain or prohibit the making or consummation of the Offer or
the Merger, (B) prohibit or impose material limitations on the ability of
Parent or the Purchaser, or otherwise to render Parent or the Purchaser
unable, to accept for payment, pay for or purchase any or all of the Shares
pursuant to the Offer or the Merger, or require divestiture of any or all of
the Shares to be purchased pursuant to the Offer or in the Merger, or (C)
prohibit or impose material limitations on the ability of Parent or the
Purchaser effectively to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership
of the Shares to be purchased pursuant to the Offer or otherwise in the
Merger, including the right to vote the Shares purchased by it on all matters
properly presented to the stockholders of the Company;

(ii) there shall be any statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or
injunction enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated or which is applicable to
the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, or any other action shall be taken by any Governmental Entity,
other than the application to the Offer or the Merger of applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act, that (x) results in any of the consequences
referred to in clauses (A) through (C) of paragraph (i) above, or (y) has the
effect of making the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by the Merger Agreement illegal or prohibits or otherwise prevents the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
the Merger Agreement;

 

(iii)(A) any representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Section
3.1_ (Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries), _Section 3.2_
(Capitalization) or _Section 3.26_ (Required Vote) shall fail to be true and
correct in all material respects as of the date of the Merger Agreement or as
of the Expiration Date with the same force and effect as if made on and as of
such date (except for representations and warranties that relate to a specific
date or time which need only be true and correct in all material respects as
of such date or time), and (B) any representation or warranty of the Company
contained in the Agreement (other than those referenced in the preceding
clauses (A) and (B), without giving effect to any references to any Company
Material Adverse Effect or materiality qualifications and
other qualifications based upon the concept of materiality or similar phrases
contained therein) shall fail to be true and correct in any respect as of the
date of the Merger Agreement or as of the Expiration Date with the same force
and effect as if made on and as of such date (except for representations and
warranties that relate to a specific date or time which need only be true and
correct as of such date or time), except as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate with all
other failures to be true or correct, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 



Annex I-1  (iv) the Company shall have breached or failed, in any material respect, to
perform or to comply with any material agreement or covenant to be performed

shall not have been cured;

shall have occurred and be continuing;

 

(vi) the Purchaser shall have failed to receive a certificate of the Company,
executed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of
the Company, dated as of the Expiration Date, to the effect that the
conditions set forth in paragraphs (iii), (iv) and (v) of this Annex I have
not occurred;

Preferred Shares then outstanding, if any, shall not have been validly
tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date;

(viii) the Company shall have ongoing obligations to issue Common Shares
pursuant to the AGI Earnout Provisions; or

(ix) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and the Purchaser
and may be asserted by Parent or the Purchaser regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent or the
Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole
discretion, in each case subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Any
reference in this Annex I or the Merger Agreement to a condition or
requirement being satisfied shall be deemed to be satisfied if such condition
or requirement is so waived, except such conditions that cannot be waived
pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The foregoing conditions shall
be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights of Parent and the
Purchaser to extend, terminate, amend and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. The failure by Parent or the
Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
