ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

            On August 21, 2000, Bank United Corp. and Washington Mutual, Inc.
announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which
Bank United will merge with and into Washington Mutual. The merger agreement
provides that in the merger each share of Bank United common stock will be
converted into the right to receive 1.3 shares of Washington Mutual common
stock, plus associated rights issued pursuant to Washington Mutual's existing
rights agreement. In connection with the transaction, Bank United shareholders
will receive contingent payment right certificates representing the right to
receive the proceeds, if any, received by Bank United or Washington Mutual
relating to Bank United's pending forbearance claim against the U.S. government,
less related taxes and expenses. Also, in connection with the Merger, each share
of Bank United's 8 percent corporate premium income equity securities will be
converted into one share of a new series of Washington Mutual's premium income
equity securities with substantially the same terms. The transaction is subject
to the approval of Bank United stockholders as well as regulatory and other
customary conditions. Copies of the merger agreement and press release
announcing this transaction are attached as exhibits hereto and are incorporated
herein by reference.

            As an inducement and condition to Washington Mutual entering into
the merger agreement, Bank United, as issuer, and Washington Mutual, as grantee,
entered into a stock option agreement, pursuant to which Bank United granted to
Washington Mutual an option to purchase 6,462,862 shares of Bank United common
stock (approximately 19.9% of those outstanding) at a price of $42.375 per
share, on certain terms and conditions set forth therein. The option agreement
is included as an exhibit hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

            This summary is qualified by reference to the exhibits attached
hereto.

in Section 2.2 hereof), Bank United Corp. shall merge (the "Merger") with and
into Washington Mutual. Washington Mutual shall be the surviving corporation
(hereinafter sometimes called the "Surviving Company") in the Merger, and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Washington. The
name of the Surviving Company shall be Washington Mutual, Inc. Upon consummation
of the merger, the separate corporate existence of Bank United Corp. shall
terminate.

      2.2   Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in
the articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") which shall be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Washington (the "Washington Secretary") and
in the certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") which shall be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary"),
on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 2.4 hereof). The term "Effective
Time" shall mean the time on the Closing Date when the Merger becomes effective,
as set forth in the Articles of Merger and the Certificate of Merger.

      2.3   Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Chapter 11 of the WBCA and Section 259 of
the DGCL.

      2.4 Closing of the Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 9:00
a.m. Pacific time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be the

or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions
set forth in Section 8 hereof, other than conditions which by their terms are to

agree (the "Closing Date"). For purposes of this Agreement, a "Business Day"
shall mean any day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday or other day on which the

Time, without any action on the part of Washington Mutual, Bank United Corp. or
the holder of any of the shares of common stock of Bank United Corp., the Merger
shall be effected in accordance with the following terms:

           (a) Each share of the Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Bank United Corp. (the "Bank United Corp. Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting
Shares (as defined in Section 2.6), if any, and shares of Bank United Corp.
Common Stock held (x) in Bank United Corp.'s treasury or (y) directly by
Washington Mutual (except for Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares, as such terms
are defined below)) shall be converted into the right to receive 1.3 shares (the
"Exchange Ratio") of common stock, no par value, of Washington Mutual
("Washington Mutual Common Stock"), together with the number of rights
("Washington Mutual Rights") issued pursuant to the


                                       4


<PAGE>



Washington Mutual Rights Agreement (as defined in Section 5.2 hereof) associated
therewith. For purposes of this Agreement, "Subsidiary" means, with respect to
any person, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company or other entity that is consolidated with such person for financial
reporting purposes.

           (b) Each share of Bank United Corp.'s 8% Corporate Premium Income
Equity Securities (including the shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock Series B
of Bank United Corp. issued and outstanding in connection therewith, the "Bank
United Corp. PIES") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive one share of Washington
Mutual's 8% Corporate Premium Income Equity Securities (including the shares of
preferred stock of Washington Mutual to be issued and outstanding in connection
therewith, the "Washington Mutual PIES"). The terms of the Washington Mutual
PIES shall be substantially the same as the terms of the Bank United Corp. PIES.
For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the Bank United Corp. Common Stock and Bank
United Corp. PIES are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Bank
United Corp. Capital Stock" and (ii) the Washington Mutual Common Stock and
Washington Mutual PIES and sometimes collectively referred to herein as the
"Washington Mutual Capital Stock."

           (c) All of the shares of Bank United Corp. Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the Washington Mutual Common Stock pursuant to this
Section 2.5 shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each a
"Common Certificate") previously representing any such shares shall thereafter
represent solely the right to receive (i) a certificate representing the number
of whole shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock and (ii) the cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which the shares of Bank United Corp. Common Stock
represented by such Common Certificate have been converted pursuant to this
Section 2.5 and Section 3.2 hereof. Common Certificates previously representing
shares of Bank United Corp. Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates
representing shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock upon the surrender of such
Common Certificates in accordance with Section 3.2 hereof, without any interest
thereon.

           (d) All of the shares of Bank United Corp. PIES converted into the
right to receive Washington Mutual PIES pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each a "PIES Certificate,"
and collectively with the Common Certificates, the "Certificates") previously
representing any such shares of Bank United Corp. PIES shall thereafter
represent the right to receive a certificate representing the number of shares
of corresponding Washington Mutual PIES into which the shares of Bank United
Corp. PIES represented by such PIES Certificate have been converted pursuant to
this Section 2.5. PIES Certificates previously representing shares of Bank
United Corp. PIES shall be exchanged for certificates representing shares of
corresponding Washington Mutual PIES issued in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such PIES Certificates in accordance with Section 3.2 hereof,
without any interest thereon.


                                       5


<PAGE>


           (e) At the Effective Time, all shares of Bank United Corp. Capital
Stock that are owned by Bank United Corp. as treasury stock and all shares of
Bank United Corp. Capital Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by
Washington Mutual or Bank United Corp. or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(other than shares of Bank United Corp. Capital Stock held directly or
indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held in
a fiduciary or nominee capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties
(any such shares being referred to herein as "Trust Account Shares") and other
than any shares of Bank United Corp. Capital Stock held by Washington Mutual or
Bank United Corp. or any of their respective Subsidiaries in respect of a debt
previously contracted (any such shares of Bank United Corp. Capital Stock being
referred to herein as "DPC Shares")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist
and no capital stock or warrants of Washington Mutual or other consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

           (f) If prior to the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Bank
United Corp. Common Stock or the outstanding shares of Washington Mutual Common
Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split,
reverse stock split, or other similar change in Bank United Corp.'s
capitalization or Washington Mutual's capitalization, respectively, then an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio.

      2.6   Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the shares of Bank United Corp. Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by holders (if any)
who have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and
who are eligible to and who have demanded appraisal rights (if any) with respect
thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective
Time, shall not have failed to perfect or shall not have effectively withdrawn
or lost their rights to appraisal and payment (if any) under Section 262 of the
DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive
shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock as described in Section 2.5, but
holders of such shares shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
such Section 262, except that any Dissenting Shares held by a holder which shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost its right to
appraisal and payment under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into the right to receive shares of Washington Mutual Common
Stock as described in Section 2.5, without interest thereon. In addition, to the
extent required under the DGCL, holders of Dissenting Shares which have
perfected and have not effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal
and payment under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be required to surrender all CPR
Certificates relating to the Dissenting Shares. Bank United Corp. shall give
Washington Mutual (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any
shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL received by Bank United Corp. relating to stockholders'
rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Bank United
Corp. shall not, except with the prior written consent of Washington Mutual,
voluntarily make any payment


                                       6


<PAGE>


with respect to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of Bank United
Corp., offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of
any such demands.

      2.7   Washington Mutual Common Stock; Washington Mutual Preferred Stock.
At and after the Effective Time, each share of Washington Mutual Common Stock
and each share of any preferred stock of Washington Mutual issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and
outstanding share of common stock or preferred stock, as the case may be, of
Washington Mutual and shall not be affected by the Merger.

      2.8   Options. At the Effective Time, each option granted by Bank United
Corp. to purchase shares of Bank United Corp. Common Stock (each a "Bank United
Corp. Option") which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto
shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Bank United Corp. Common
Stock and shall be converted automatically into (i) the right to receive, upon
exercise of the option, one CPR Certificate for each share of Bank United Corp.
Common Stock that would have been issuable upon exercise in full of such Bank
United Corp. Option and (ii) an option to purchase shares of Washington Mutual
Common Stock in an amount and at an exercise price determined as provided below
(and otherwise subject to the terms of the Bank United Corp. 1999 Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended to date, the Bank United Corp. 1996 Stock Incentive
Plan, as amended to date, the Bank United Corp. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as
amended to date, the Executive Management Compensation Program, as amended to
date or the Bank United Corp. Director Stock Plan, as amended to date, as
applicable (collectively, the "Bank United Corp. Stock Option Plans"), and the
agreements evidencing grants thereunder):

           (a) the number of shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock to be
subject to the new option shall be equal to the product of the number of shares
of Bank United Corp. Common Stock subject to the original option and the
Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of Washington Mutual Common
Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest share;
and

           (b) the exercise price per share of Washington Mutual Common Stock
under the new option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Bank
United Corp. Common Stock under the original option divided by the Exchange
Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded to the nearest cent.

      In the case of any options which are "incentive stock options" (as defined
in Section 422 of the Code), the exercise price, the number of shares
purchasable pursuant to such options and the terms and conditions of exercise of
such options shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the
Code. The duration and other terms of each new option shall be the same as the
applicable original option except that all references to Bank United Corp. shall
be deemed to be references to Washington Mutual.

      2.9   Articles of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation of Washington Mutual, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Articles of


                                       7


<PAGE>


Incorporation of the Surviving Company, until thereafter amended in accordance
with applicable law.

      2.10  Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Washington Mutual, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

      2.11  Board of Directors. The directors of Washington Mutual immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be the directors of the Surviving
Company, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws of the Surviving Company, until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed (as the case may be) and qualified.

      2.12  Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

      2.13  Stock Option Agreement. As an inducement to Washington Mutual to
continue to pursue the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Bank United
Corp. is granting to Washington Mutual an option pursuant to the Stock Option
Agreement in the form of Exhibit 2.12 hereto (the "Stock Option Agreement").

      2.14  Reservation of Right to Revise Structure. Washington Mutual may at
any time change the method of effecting the business combination contemplated by
this Agreement if and to the extent that it deems such a change to be desirable,
including, without limitation, to provide for a merger of Bank United Corp. with
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Washington Mutual; provided, however, that no such
change shall (A) alter or change the amount or kind of consideration to be
received by holders of Bank United Corp. Capital Stock under this Agreement (the
"Merger Consideration"), or (B) adversely affect the anticipated tax
consequences of the Merger to the holders of Bank United Corp. Capital Stock as
a result of receiving the Merger Consideration, or (C) materially impede or
delay consummation of the Merger. In the event Washington Mutual elects to make
such a change, the parties agree to execute appropriate documents to reflect the
change.

      3.1   Washington Mutual to Make Shares Available. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Washington Mutual shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,

Mutual and Bank United Corp. or with Washington Mutual's transfer agent (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange
in accordance with this Section 3, certificates representing the shares of
Washington Mutual Common Stock and Washington Mutual PIES and an estimated

with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund") to be issued pursuant to Section 2.5 and
paid pursuant to Section 3.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Bank
United Corp. Capital Stock.

      3.2   Exchange of Shares.

           (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing, as the case may be, the shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock
or Washington Mutual PIES and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Washington
Mutual Common Stock, if any, into which the shares of Bank United Corp. Capital
Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange
and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate
representing that number of shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock to which
such former holder of Bank United Corp. Common Stock shall have become entitled
pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 hereof, and (ii) a certificate
representing that number of shares of Washington Mutual PIES to which such
former holder of Bank United Corp. PIES shall have become entitled pursuant to
the provisions of Section 2 hereof and (iii) a check representing the amount of
cash (if any) payable in lieu of fractional shares of Washington Mutual Common
Stock, which such former holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Common Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares.

           (b) No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time with respect to Washington Mutual Common Stock or Washington
Mutual PIES shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until
the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
Section 3.  After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Section
3, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with


                                       9


<PAGE>


respect to shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock or Washington
Mutual PIES represented by such Certificate.

           (c) If any certificate representing shares of Washington Mutual
Common Stock or Washington Mutual PIES is to be issued in the name of other than
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it
shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing
shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock or Washington Mutual PIES in the name
of and payment of cash to any person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such
holder or requesting person, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

           (d) At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of Bank United Corp. of the shares of Bank United Corp.
Capital Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.  If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such
shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged for certificates representing shares of Washington Mutual Capital
Stock as provided in this Section 3.

           (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Washington Mutual Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Common Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Washington Mutual Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of
a stockholder of Washington Mutual. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, Washington Mutual shall pay to each former holder of Bank
United Corp. Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive such
fractional share an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the average of
the closing prices of Washington Mutual Common Stock on The New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") as reported by the Wall Street Journal for the five trading
days immediately preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share of
Washington Mutual Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.5 hereof. For purposes of determining any such
fractional share interests, all shares of Bank United Corp. Common Stock
beneficially owned by any Bank United Corp. stockholder shall be combined so as
to calculate the maximum number of shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock
issuable to such holder of Bank United Corp. Common Stock.

           (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Bank United Corp. for twelve months after the Effective Time
shall be paid, at the request of Washington Mutual, to Washington Mutual. Any
stockholders of Bank United Corp. who have not theretofore complied with this
Section 3 shall thereafter look only to Washington Mutual for payment of the
shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock,

Washington Mutual PIES, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Washington Mutual Common Stock or Washington
Mutual PIES, as the case may be, deliverable in respect of each share of Bank
United Corp. Common Stock or Bank United Corp. PIES, as the case may be, held by
such stockholder at the Effective Time as determined pursuant to this Agreement,
in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, none of Washington Mutual, Bank United Corp., the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Bank United Corp. Common Stock or Bank United Corp. PIES, for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

           (g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Washington
Mutual, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Washington Mutual
may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of
Washington Mutual Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares or the
Washington Mutual PIES, as the case may be, deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

4.    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BANK UNITED CORP.

           Bank United Corp. hereby represents and warrants to Washington
Mutual as follows:

      4.1   Corporate Organization.

           (a) Bank United Corp. is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Bank
United Corp. has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified
would not have nor reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below) on Bank United Corp. As used in this Agreement, the term
"Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to Bank United Corp., Washington
Mutual or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse
effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects
of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or a material adverse effect
on such party's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a
timely basis; provided, however, that in determining whether a Material Adverse
Effect has occurred, there shall be excluded any effect on the referenced party
the cause of which is (i) any change in banking, savings association and similar
laws, rules or regulations of general applicability or interpretations thereof
by courts or governmental authorities, (ii) any change in generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") or regulatory accounting requirements applicable
to banks, savings associations, or their holding


                                       11

companies generally, (iii) the announcement of this Agreement or action or
omission of Bank United Corp. or Washington Mutual or any Subsidiary of either
of them taken in accordance with this Agreement or with the prior written
consent of Washington Mutual or Bank United Corp., as applicable, in
contemplation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) any
changes in general economic conditions affecting banks, savings associations, or
their holding companies generally, provided that the effect of such changes
described in this clause (iv) (including, without limitation, changes in the
interest rates) shall not be excluded to the extent of the disproportionate
impact (if any) they have on such person. Bank United Corp. is duly registered
as a savings and loan holding company under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as
amended ("HOLA"), and qualifies as a savings and loan holding company of the
type described in Section 10(c)(3)(A) of HOLA. The copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Bank United Corp. which have previously been made
available to Washington Mutual are true, complete and correct copies of such
documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

           (b) Each Subsidiary of Bank United Corp. (i) is duly organized and
validly existing as a corporation or partnership under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business
and is in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or
foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its
business requires it to be so licensed or qualified and in which the failure to
be so qualified would have or would reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Bank United
Corp., and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

           (c) LBW Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings") is duly registered as a savings
and loan holding company under HOLA and qualifies as a savings and loan holding
company of the type described in Section 10(c)(3)(A) of HOLA.

qualified thrift lender pursuant to Section 10(m) of HOLA and its deposits are
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") through the
Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF") to the fullest extent permitted by
law. Bank United of Texas is a member in good standing of the Federal Home Loan
Bank ("FHLB") of Dallas. Bank United of Texas has not been advised by the Office
of Thrift Supervision ("OTS") that it does not qualify as a savings association
described in Section 10(c)(3)(B)(i) of HOLA.

Schedule"), (ii) pursuant to the Option, (iii) pursuant to the Bank United Corp.
PIES and (iv) as set forth elsewhere in this Section 4.2(a), Bank United Corp.
does not have and is not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,

United Corp. Disclosure Schedule, since July 31, 2000, Bank United Corp. has not

indirectly, any equity interest (regardless of whether such entity is a

term is defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X) of Bank United Corp. Each
Controlled Entity in which Bank United Corp. or any Bank United Corp. Subsidiary

creditors' rights and remedies generally. Bank United Corp. acknowledges that
Washington Mutual may elect at or promptly after the Effective Time to cause the
merger of Holdings and one of Washington Mutual's wholly owned Subsidiaries (the
"Second Merger") and the merger of Bank United of Texas and Washington Mutual
Bank, FA, a wholly owned depository institution subsidiary of Washington Mutual
(the "Association Merger"); provided, however, that Washington Mutual agrees

accordance with GAAP have been provided. Washington Mutual is not aware of any
fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger
from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

United Corp. an accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed since January
1, 1999 and prior to the date hereof by Washington Mutual with the SEC pursuant
to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the "Washington Mutual Reports"), and
no such registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule or proxy statement
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. Washington Mutual and its Subsidiaries have timely filed all
Washington Mutual Reports and other documents required to be filed by them under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and, as of their respective dates, all
Washington Mutual Reports complied in all material respects with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.

of the Washington Mutual Disclosure Schedule, Washington Mutual and each of its
Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times held, all material licenses,

respective businesses under and pursuant to all, and have complied with and are
not in default in any material respect under any, applicable law, statute,
order, rule, regulation, policy and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity
relating to Washington Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries, except where the
failure to hold such license, franchise, permit or authorization or such
noncompliance or default would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Washington Mutual,
and neither Washington Mutual nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has
received notice of, any material violations of any of the above which,
individually or in the aggregate, would have or reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Washington Mutual.

      5.13  Agreements with Regulatory Agencies. Except as set forth in Section

consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any
commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or
directive by, or has adopted any board resolutions at the request of (each,
whether or not set forth in Section 5.12 of the Washington Mutual Disclosure
Schedule, a "Washington Mutual Regulatory Agreement"), any Governmental Entity
that restricts the conduct of its business or relates to its capital adequacy,
its credit policies, its management or its business, nor has Washington Mutual
or any of its Subsidiaries been advised by any Governmental Entity that it is
considering issuing or requesting any Regulatory Agreement.

reflected on reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Washington
Mutual included in the Washington Mutual Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March
31, 2000 or for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since March 31, 2000, neither Washington Mutual
nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become
due) that, either alone or when combined with all similar liabilities, has had,
or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Washington
Mutual.

      5.15  Rights Agreement; Anti-takeover Provisions. Washington Mutual has
taken all action (including, if required, redeeming all of the outstanding
Rights issued pursuant to the Washington Mutual Rights Agreement or amending or
terminating the Washington Mutual Rights Agreement) so that the entering into of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do
not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any person under the
Washington Mutual Rights Agreement or enable or require the Washington Mutual to
be exercised, distributed or triggered. The Board of Directors of Washington
Mutual has taken all necessary action so that the takeover laws of the
Washington Business Corporation Act and any comparable provisions of Washington
Mutual's Articles of Incorporation do not and will not apply to this Agreement,
the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby.

      5.16  Washington Mutual Information. The information relating to
Washington Mutual and its Subsidiaries to be provided by Washington Mutual to be
contained in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the S-4 and the CPR Trust
Registration Statement, or in any other document filed with any other
Governmental Entity in connection herewith, will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made,
not misleading. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus (except for such portions thereof
that relate only to Bank United Corp. or any of its Subsidiaries) will comply
as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. The S-4 will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

      5.17  Environmental Liability. Except as set forth in Section 5.17 of the
Washington Mutual Disclosure Schedule, there are no legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private
environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental
investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that reasonably would be
expected to result in the imposition, on Washington Mutual or any of its
Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation arising under any Environmental Law,
pending or, to the knowledge of Washington Mutual, threatened, against
Washington Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries, which liability or obligation that
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Washington
Mutual. To the knowledge of Washington Mutual, there is no reasonable basis for
any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would
impose any liability or obligation that would have or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Washington Mutual. To the
knowledge of Washington Mutual, during or prior to the period of (i) its or any
of its Subsidiaries' ownership or operation of any of their respective current
properties, (ii) its or any of its Subsidiaries' participation in the management
of any property, or (iii) its or any of its Subsidiaries' holding of a security
interest or other interest in any property, there were no releases or threatened
releases of hazardous, toxic, radioactive or dangerous materials or other
materials regulated under Environmental Laws in, on, under or affecting any such
property, which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Washington Mutual. Neither Washington Mutual nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or
with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or third party
imposing any material liability or obligation pursuant to or under any
Environmental Law that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Washington Mutual.

      5.18  Opinion of Financial Advisor.  Washington Mutual has received the
opinion of Lehman Brothers, Inc., dated August 18, 2000, to the effect that,
as of such date, the Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of view to
Washington Mutual.

      5.19  Community Reinvestment Act Compliance. Each of Washington Mutual
subsidiary depository institutions is in compliance in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the CRA and has received a CRA rating of
"outstanding" from the OTS in its most recent exam, and Washington Mutual has no
knowledge of the existence of any fact or circumstances or set of facts or
circumstances which could be reasonably expected to result in any of such
institutions failing to be in compliance in all material respects with such
provisions or having its current rating lowered.

           (e) Washington Mutual and Bank United Corp. shall promptly advise
each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose
consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions

this Agreement or in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding

properties, books, contracts and records relating to the assets, stock
ownership, properties, obligations, operations and liabilities of Washington
Mutual and its Subsidiaries, and to its officers, employees, accountants,
counsel and other representatives, in all cases in which Bank United Corp. may
have a reasonable interest. Washington Mutual and its Subsidiaries shall not be

disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of Washington Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries or
 contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. The parties hereto
will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

stockholder approval required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger;

hold such meeting at any time substantially earlier than the time when
Washington Mutual anticipates receiving all requisite regulatory approvals for
the Merger. Bank United Corp. shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend
to its stockholders approval of the Merger; provided, however, that this
Section 7.3 shall not prohibit accurate disclosure by Bank United Corp. of
information that is required in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any other
document required to be filed with the SEC (including without limitation a
disclosure statement on Schedule 14D-9) or otherwise required by applicable law
or regulation or the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market to be publicly disclosed;
provided, further, however, that Bank United Corp. may withdraw or modify such
recommendation to the extent that its Board of Directors, after consulting with
its financial advisers and outside counsel, has determined in its reasonable
good faith judgment that such action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law. In the event that the Board of Directors of Bank
United Corp. withdraws or modifies its recommendation in accordance with the
preceding sentence, the Board shall nevertheless submit this Agreement and the
Merger to its stockholders for approval.

      7.8   Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

           (a) From and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened
or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal or administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any person who is now, or has
been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of Bank United Corp. or any
of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made
a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of
Bank United Corp., any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors or was prior to the Effective Time serving at the request of any
such party as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another
corporation, partnership, trust or other enterprise (a list of which with
respect to the directors, officers or employees of Bank United Corp. or any of
its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement is set forth in Section 7.8(a)
of the Bank United Corp. Disclosure Schedule) or (ii) this Agreement, or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby and all actions taken by an Indemnified
Party in connection herewith, whether in any case asserted or arising before or
after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate in connection
with defending against and responding to such proceedings. It is understood and
agreed that after the Effective Time, Washington Mutual shall indemnify and hold
harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by the corporate governance
documents of Bank United Corp. or its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof and by
law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses
in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Parry to the fullest extent permitted by law
upon receipt of an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL, from such
Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses if it is finally and
unappealably determined that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after
the Effective Time) (collectively, "Claims"), the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with Washington
Mutual; provided, however, that (1) Washington Mutual shall not be liable for
any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld) and (2) Washington Mutual shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and
nonappealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by the corporate governance documents of Bank
United Corp. or its Subsidiaries or applicable law. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 7.8, upon learning of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Washington
Mutual thereof, provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect the
obligations of Washington Mutual under this Section 7.8 except (and only) to the
extent such failure to notify materially prejudices Washington Mutual.

           (b) Without limiting any of the obligations under paragraph (a) of
this Section 7.8, Washington Mutual agrees that all rights to indemnification
and all limitations of


                                       43


<PAGE>


liability existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in Bank
United Corp.'s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or in the similar
governing documents of any of Bank United Corp.'s Subsidiaries as in effect as
of the date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring on or prior to
the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect thereafter, without any amendment thereto; provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Section 7.8(b) shall be deemed to preclude the
liquidation, consolidation or merger of Bank United Corp. or any Subsidiary
thereof, in which case all of such rights to indemnification and limitations on
liability shall be deemed to so survive and continue notwithstanding any such
liquidation, consolidation or merger and shall constitute rights which may be
asserted against Washington Mutual. Nothing contained in this Section 7.8(b)
shall be deemed to preclude any rights to indemnification or limitations on
liability provided in Washington Mutual's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or
the similar governing documents of any of Washington Mutual's Subsidiaries with
respect to matters occurring subsequent to the Effective Time to the extent that
the provisions establishing such rights or limitations are not otherwise amended
to the contrary.

           (c) Washington Mutual shall use its best efforts to cause the persons
serving as officers and directors of Bank United Corp. immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date
by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy or policies
maintained by Washington Mutual (provided that Washington Mutual's policy or
policies provide at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are not less advantageous to such directors and officers of
Bank United Corp. than the terms and conditions of the existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy of Bank United Corp., and provided further
that in no event will Washington Mutual be required to expend in any one year an
amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by Bank United
Corp. for such insurance (the "Insurance Amount"), and further provided, that if
Washington Mutual is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by
this Section 7.8(c) as a result of the preceding proviso, Washington Mutual
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as
available for the Insurance Amount) with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors
in their capacity as such. The provisions of this Section 7.8 are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his
or her heirs and representatives.

      7.9   Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary of
Washington Mutual and a Subsidiary of Bank United Corp.) or to vest the
Surviving Company with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective
Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested
by Washington Mutual.

9.    TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

      9.1   Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Effective Time:

           (a)   by mutual consent of Washington Mutual and Bank United Corp. in
a written instrument, if the Board of Directors of each so determines;

           (b) by either Washington Mutual or Bank United Corp. if (i) any
Governmental Entity which must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied
approval of the Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or
(ii) any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

           (c) by either Washington Mutual or Bank United Corp. if the Effective
Time shall not have occurred on or before March 31, 2001, unless the failure of
the Effective Time to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth herein; provided, however, if the failure
of the Effective Time to occur by March 31, 2001 is solely due to the failure to
satisfy the condition set forth in Section 8.1(c), then the termination right
set forth in this Section 9.1(c) shall not be exercisable until June 30, 2001;

           (d) by either Washington Mutual or Bank United Corp. (provided that
the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other


                                       50


<PAGE>


agreement contained herein) if the other party shall have breached (i) any of
the covenants or agreements made by such other party herein or (ii) any of the
representations or warranties made by such other party herein, and in either
case, such breach (x) is not cured within 30 days following written notice to
the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be
cured prior to the Closing and (y) would entitle the non-breaching party not to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby under Section 8 hereof;

           (e)   by either Washington Mutual or Bank United Corp. if any
approval of the stockholders of Bank United Corp. contemplated by this Agreement
shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required
vote at a duly held meeting of stockholders or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof;

           (f) by the Board of Directors of Washington Mutual, if the Board of
Directors of Bank United Corp. shall have failed to recommend the Merger, or
shall have withdrawn, modified or changed in a manner adverse to Washington
Mutual its approval;

           (g) by the Board of Directors of Washington Mutual if a tender offer
or exchange offer for 25% or more of the outstanding shares of Bank United Corp.
Common Stock is commenced (other than by Washington Mutual or a Subsidiary
thereof), and the Board of Directors of Bank United Corp. recommends that the
stockholders of Bank United Corp. tender their shares in such tender or exchange
offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such stockholders reject such tender
offer or exchange offer within 10 Business Days after the commencement thereof
(which, in the case of an exchange offer, shall be the effective date of the
registration statement relating to such exchange offer);

           (h)   by Washington Mutual if a Subsequent Triggering Event (as
defined in the Stock Option Agreement) has occurred;

           (i)   by Washington Mutual if a Material Adverse Change (as defined
below) has occurred with respect to Bank United Corp.; or

           (j)   by Bank United Corp. if a Material Adverse Change has occurred
with respect to Washington Mutual.

           As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Change" means,
with respect to Bank United Corp. or Washington Mutual, as the case may be, a
material adverse change since June 30, 2000, in the business, results of
operations, financial condition or prospects of such party and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole; provided, however, that in determining whether a Material
Adverse Change has occurred, there shall be excluded any change in the
referenced party the cause of which is (i) any change in banking, savings
association and similar laws, rules or regulations of general applicability or
interpretations thereof by courts or governmental authorities, (ii) any change
in GAAP or regulatory accounting requirements applicable to banks, savings
associations, or their holding companies generally, (iii) announcement of this
Agreement or any action or omission of Bank United Corp. or Washington Mutual or
any Subsidiary of either of them taken in accordance with this Agreement or with
the prior written consent of Washington Mutual or Bank United Corp., as
applicable, in


                                       51


<PAGE>


contemplation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) any
changes in general economic conditions affecting banks, savings associations, or
their holding companies generally, provided that the effect of such changes
described in this clause (iv) (including, without limitation, changes in the
interest rates) shall not be excluded to the extent of the disproportionate
impact (if any) they have on such person.

      9.2   Effect of Termination.

           (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either
Washington Mutual or Bank United Corp. as provided in Section 9.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Washington
Mutual, Bank United Corp., any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the
officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature
whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, except that (i) Sections 7.2(b), 9.2, and 10.2 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, neither Washington Mutual nor Bank United Corp.
shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.

           (b) If this Agreement is terminated (A) by Washington Mutual pursuant
to Section 9.1(f) if the failure to recommend or the withdrawal, modification or
change of recommendation forming the basis for such termination occurs after a
bona fide Takeover Proposal shall have been made known to the Board of Directors
of Bank United Corp. or shall have been publicly disclosed to Bank United
Corp.'s stockholders, or any person or entity shall have made known to the Board
of Directors of Bank United Corp., or otherwise publicly disclosed, a bona fide
intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal or pursuant
to Section 9.1(g), (B) by Washington Mutual pursuant to Section 9.1(h), or (C)
by Washington Mutual pursuant to Section 9.1(d) if the breach giving rise to
such termination was willful and, at or prior to such willful violation forming
the basis for such termination, a bona fide Takeover Proposal shall have been
made known to the Board of Directors of Bank United Corp. or shall have been
publicly disclosed to Bank United Corp.'s stockholders, or any person or entity
shall have made known to the Board of Directors of Bank United Corp., or
otherwise publicly disclosed, a bona fide intention (whether or not conditional)
to make a Takeover Proposal, and regardless of whether such Takeover Proposal
shall have been rejected by Bank United Corp. or withdrawn prior to the time of
such termination, then in any such case Bank United Corp. shall pay to
Washington Mutual, upon Washington Mutual's written request, a termination fee
of $15 million (the "Initial Termination Fee"). In addition, if (x) within 15
months of any such termination described in the preceding sentence that gave
rise to an obligation to pay the Initial Termination Fee or (y) within 15 months
after this Agreement is terminated by Washington Mutual or Bank United Corp.
pursuant to Section 9.1(e) because of a failure to obtain the required approval
of the stockholders of Bank United Corp. after a bona fide Takeover Proposal for
Bank United Corp. shall have been publicly disclosed, or any person or entity
shall have publicly disclosed a bona fide intention (whether or not conditional)
to make a Takeover Proposal, (1) Bank United Corp. shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummated a transaction contemplated
in, a Takeover Proposal or (2) a Repurchase Event (as defined in the Option
Agreement) shall have occurred, then (a) in the case


                                       52


<PAGE>


of clause (x) above, Bank United Corp. shall pay to Washington Mutual, upon
Washington Mutual's written request, an additional termination fee equal to
$37 million (the "Subsequent Termination Fee" and together with the Initial
Termination Fee, the "Termination Fee") or (b) in the case of clause (y) above,
Bank United Corp. shall pay to Washington Mutual, upon Washington Mutual's
written request, the entire Termination Fee equal to $52 million. Washington
Mutual shall not be entitled to either the Initial Termination Fee or the
Subsequent Termination Fee or the Termination Fee if Washington Mutual has
exercised all or any part of the Option.

           (c) Any Termination Fee that becomes payable pursuant to
Section 9.2(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by Washington Mutual within one Business Day following the
receipt by Bank United Corp. of a written request from Washington Mutual for
payment of such Termination Fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall Bank United Corp. be obligated to pay any such fees to Washington Mutual
if immediately prior to the termination hereof Bank United Corp. was entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d).

           (d) Bank United Corp. and Washington Mutual agree that the agreements
contained in paragraphs (b) and (c) above are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without such agreements
Washington Mutual would not have entered into this Agreement, and that such
amounts do not constitute a penalty. If Bank United Corp. fails to pay
Washington Mutual the amounts due under paragraph (b) above within the time
periods specified in paragraph (c) above, Bank United Corp. shall pay the costs
and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by
Washington Mutual in connection with any action, including the filing of any
lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on the
amount of any such unpaid amounts at the publicly announced prime rate of The
Chase Manhattan Bank from the date such amounts were required to be paid.

      9.3   Amendment. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of Bank
United Corp.; provided, however, that after any approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by Bank United Corp.'s stockholders, there may
not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this
Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to
be delivered to the Bank United Corp. stockholders hereunder other than as
contemplated by this Agreement or which negatively impacts the intended tax
treatment of the holders of Bank United Corp. Common Stock. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the parties hereto.

      9.4   Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the


                                       53


<PAGE>


part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

10.   GENERAL PROVISIONS

      10.1  Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. None of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or

      10.6  Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the documents and
the  instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement(s).

      10.7  Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law provisions (except to the extent that mandatory
provisions of federal law or the DGCL are applicable).

      10.8  Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable

is affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or its stockholders.
Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an
effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the
original intent of the parties.

consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent
practicable in the circumstances) issue such press release or make such public
statement as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by law or the
rules and regulations of the NYSE (in the case of Washington Mutual) or The
Nasdaq Stock Market (in the case of Bank United Corp.). Without limiting the
reach of the preceding sentence, Washington Mutual and Bank United Corp. shall

sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 7.8 hereof, this
Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder.

    THE TRANSFER OF THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS CONTAINED
          HEREIN AND TO RESALE RESTRICTIONS UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
                                1933, AS AMENDED

      STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT, dated August 18, 2000, between Bank United
Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Issuer"), and Washington Mutual, Inc., a
Washington corporation ("Grantee").

                                   WITNESSETH:

      WHEREAS, Grantee and Issuer have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger of even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement"), which agreement has been
executed by the parties hereto immediately prior to this Stock Option Agreement
(this "Agreement"); and

      WHEREAS, as a condition to Grantee's entering into the Merger Agreement
and in consideration therefor, Issuer has agreed to grant Grantee the Option (as
hereinafter defined);

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

      1.    Grant of Option.

           (a) Issuer hereby grants to Grantee an unconditional, irrevocable
option (the "Option") to purchase, subject to the terms hereof, up to an
aggregate of 6,462,862 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Issuer's Class A
Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), at a price of $42.375
per share (the "Option Price"); provided, however, that in no event shall the
number of shares of Common Stock for which this Option is exercisable exceed
19.9% of the Issuer's issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock without
giving effect to any shares subject to or issued pursuant to the Option. The
number of shares of Common Stock that may be received upon the exercise of the
Option and the Option Price are subject to adjustment as herein set forth.

           (b) In the event that any shares of Common Stock are either (i)
issued or otherwise become outstanding after the date of this Agreement (other
than pursuant to this Agreement and other than pursuant to an event described in
Section 5 hereof) or (ii) redeemed, repurchased, retired or otherwise cease to
be outstanding after the date of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common
Stock subject to the Option shall be increased or decreased, as appropriate, so
that, after such issuance or such redemption, repurchase, retirement or other
action, such number equals 19.9% of the number of shares of Common Stock then
issued and outstanding without giving effect to any shares subject to or issued
pursuant to the Option. Nothing contained in this Section 1(b) or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall be deemed to authorize Issuer or Grantee to issue, redeem,
repurchase or retire shares in breach of any provision of the Merger Agreement.


<PAGE>


      2.    Exercise of Option.

           (a) The Holder (as hereinafter defined) may exercise the Option, in
whole or part, and from time to time, if both an Initial Triggering Event (as
hereinafter defined) and a Subsequent Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined)
shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an Exercise Termination Event (as
hereinafter defined); provided, that the Holder shall have sent written notice
of such exercise (as provided in subsection (e) of this Section 2) within 3
months following such Subsequent Triggering Event (or such longer period as
provided in Section 10); provided further, however, that if the Option cannot be
exercised on any day because of any injunction, order or similar restraint
issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, the period during which the Option
may be exercised shall be extended so that the Option shall expire no earlier
than on the tenth business day after such injunction, order or restraint shall
have been dissolved or when such injunction, order or restraint shall have
become permanent and no longer subject to appeal, as the case may be. Each of
the following shall be an "Exercise Termination Event": (i) the Effective Time
(as defined in the Merger Agreement); (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement
in accordance with the provisions thereof if such termination occurs prior to
the occurrence of an Initial Triggering Event, except a termination by Grantee
pursuant to Section 9.1(d) of the Merger Agreement (unless the breach by Issuer
giving rise to such right of termination is non-volitional); (iii) the passage
of 12 months after termination of the Merger Agreement if such termination
follows or is concurrent with the occurrence of an Initial Triggering Event or
is a termination by Grantee pursuant to Section 9.1(d) of the Merger Agreement
(unless the breach by Issuer giving rise to such right of termination is
non-volitional); provided, that if the Initial Triggering Event continues or
occurs beyond such termination and prior to the passage of such 12-month period,
the Exercise Termination Event shall be 12 months from the expiration of the
Last Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) but in no event more than 15
months after such termination; or (iv) delivery of a written request for payment
of termination fee pursuant to Section 9.2 of the Merger Agreement (provided
that no such Exercise Termination Event shall be deemed to have occurred unless
the full amount of such termination fee provided for in such Section 9.2 has
been paid). For purposes of this Agreement, (A) "Holder" shall mean the holder
or holders of the Option and (B) "Last Triggering Event" shall mean the last
Initial Triggering Event to expire. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, (i) the Option may not be exercised at any time when Grantee shall be in
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in the Merger Agreement such that Issuer would be entitled to
terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d) thereof and (ii) this
Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the termination of the Merger
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d) thereof as a result of the breach by
Grantee of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
the Merger Agreement.

           (b) The term "Initial Triggering Event" shall mean any of the
following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof:

               (i) Issuer or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, as defined in
Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (each an "Issuer Subsidiary"), without having received Grantee's
prior written consent, shall have entered into an


                                       2


<PAGE>


agreement to engage in an Acquisition Transaction (as hereinafter
defined) with any person (the term "person" for purposes of this Agreement
having the meaning assigned thereto in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), and the rules and
regulations thereunder) other than Grantee or any of its Subsidiaries (each a
"Grantee Subsidiary") or the Board of Directors of Issuer shall have recommended
that the stockholders of Issuer  approve or accept any Acquisition Transaction
with any person other than Grantee or a Subsidiary of Grantee. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (x) a merger or
consolidation, or any similar transaction, involving Issuer or any Issuer
Subsidiary, (y) a purchase, lease or other acquisition or assumption of all or a
substantial portion of the assets or deposits of Issuer or any Issuer
Subsidiary, or (z) a purchase or other acquisition (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of beneficial ownership (the term
"beneficial ownership" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning
assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and
regulations thereunder) of securities representing 10% or more of the voting
power of Issuer; provided, however, that in no event shall any merger,
consolidation, purchase or similar transaction involving only Issuer and one or
more of Issuer Subsidiaries or involving only two or more of Issuer
Subsidiaries, be deemed to be an Acquisition Transaction, provided that any such
transaction is not entered into in violation of the terms of the Merger
Agreement;

               (ii)      (A) Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary, without having
received Grantee's prior written consent, shall have authorized, recommended,
proposed or publicly announced its intention to authorize, recommend or propose,
to engage in an Acquisition Transaction with any person other than Grantee or a
Grantee Subsidiary, or (B) the Board of Directors of Issuer shall have failed to
make its recommendation that the stockholders of Issuer approve the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement in anticipation of engaging in an
Acquisition Transaction, or (C) the Board of Directors of Issuer shall have
publicly withdrawn or modified, or publicly announced its interest to withdraw
or modify, in any manner adverse to Grantee, its recommendation that the
stockholders of Issuer approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement in anticipation of engaging in an Acquisition Transaction;

               (iii) Any person, other than Grantee, any Grantee Subsidiary or
any Issuer Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity in the ordinary course of
its business, shall have acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock;

               (iv) The stockholders of Issuer shall have voted and failed to
approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger at a meeting that has been
held for that purpose or any adjournment or postponement thereof, or such
meeting shall not have been held in violation of the Merger Agreement if, prior
to such meeting (or if such meeting shall not have been held or shall have been
canceled, prior to such termination), any person other than Grantee or any
Grantee Subsidiary shall have made a bona fide proposal to Issuer or its
stockholders by public announcement or written communication that is or becomes
the subject of public disclosure to engage in an Acquisition Transaction;


                                       3


<PAGE>


               (v) After a bona fide proposal or intention is made or made known
by a third party to Issuer or its stockholders to engage in an Acquisition
Transaction (whether such proposal or intention becomes the subject of public
disclosure or not), Issuer shall have willfully breached any covenant or
obligation contained in the Merger Agreement or willfully breached any
representation or warranty contained in the Merger Agreement and such breach (x)
would entitle Grantee to terminate the Merger Agreement and (y) shall not have
been cured prior to the Notice Date (as defined below);

               (vi) Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary,
other than in connection with a transaction to which Grantee has given its prior
written consent, shall have filed an application or notice with the Office of
Thrift Supervision ("OTS"), the Federal Reserve Board, or other federal or state
bank regulatory authority, which application or notice has been accepted for
processing, for approval to engage in an Acquisition Transaction; or

               (vii) Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary
commences or publicly announces its bona fide intention to commence a tender
offer or exchange offer for securities representing 10% or more of the voting
power of Issuer.

           (c) The term "Subsequent Triggering Event" shall mean either of the
following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof:

               (i)   The acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of
25% or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock; or (ii) The
occurrence of the Initial Triggering Event described in Section 2(b)(i) hereof,
except that the percentage incorporated by reference to the definition of
Significant Subsidiary in subsection (x) and referred to in subsection (z)
thereof shall be 25%.

           (d) Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence
of any Initial Triggering Event or Subsequent Triggering Event of which it has
notice, it being understood that the giving of such notice by Issuer shall not
be a condition to the right of the Holder to exercise the Option.

           (e) In the event the Holder is entitled to and wishes to exercise the
Option, it shall send to Issuer a written notice (the date of which being herein
referred to as the "Notice Date") specifying (i) the total number of shares it
will purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a place and date not earlier
than three business days nor later than 60 business days from the Notice Date
for the closing of such purchase (the "Closing Date"); provided that if prior
notification to or approval of any regulatory or antitrust agency is required in
connection with such purchase, the Holder shall promptly file the required
notice or application for approval, shall promptly notify Issuer of such filing
and shall expeditiously process the same and the period of time that otherwise
would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which any
required notification periods have expired or been terminated or such approvals
have been obtained and any requisite waiting period or periods shall have
passed. Any exercise of the Option shall be deemed to occur on the Notice Date
relating thereto.


                                       4


<PAGE>


           (f) At the closing referred to in subsection (e) of this Section 2,
the Holder shall pay to Issuer the aggregate purchase price for the shares of
Common Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer,
provided that failure or refusal of Issuer to designate such a bank account
shall not preclude the Holder from exercising the Option.

           (g) At such closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately
available funds as provided in subsection (f) of this Section 2, Issuer shall
deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing the number of
shares of Common Stock purchased by the Holder and, if the Option should be
exercised in part only, a new Agreement for an Option evidencing the rights of
the Holder thereof to purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder,
and the Holder shall deliver to Issuer this Agreement and a letter agreeing that
the Holder will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such shares in
violation of applicable law or the provisions of this Agreement.

           (h) Certificates for Common Stock delivered at a closing hereunder
may be endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read substantially as
follows:

      "The transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject to
      certain provisions of an agreement between the registered holder hereof
      and Bank United Corp. and to resale restrictions arising under the
      Securities Act of 1933, as amended. A copy of such agreement is on file at
      the principal office of Bank United Corp. and will be provided to the
      holder hereof without charge upon receipt by Bank United Corp. of a
      written request therefor."

It is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), in the above legend
shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference
if the Holder shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), or an opinion of counsel,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer, to the effect that such
legend is not required for purposes of the 1933 Act; (ii) the reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of
substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have been sold or
transferred in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and under
circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference in the opinion
of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer; and (iii)
the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the conditions in the preceding
subsections (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. In addition, such certificates
shall bear any other legend as may be required by law.

               (i) Upon the giving by the Holder to Issuer of the written notice
of exercise of the Option provided for under subsection (e) of this Section 2
and the tender of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds,
the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books
of Issuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of
Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to the Holder. Issuer shall
pay all expenses, and any and all United States federal, state and local taxes
and other charges that may


                                       5


<PAGE>


be payable in connection with the preparation, issue and delivery of stock
certificates under this Section 2 in the name of the Holder or its assignee,
transferee or designee.

      3.    Certain Issuer Actions. Issuer agrees: (i) that it shall at all
times maintain, free from preemptive rights, sufficient authorized but unissued
or treasury shares of Common Stock so that the Option may be exercised without
additional authorization of Common Stock after giving effect to all other
options, warrants, convertible securities and other rights to purchase Common
Stock; (ii) that it will not, by charter amendment or through reorganization,
consolidation, merger, dissolution or sale of assets, or by any other voluntary
act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
covenants, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by
Issuer; (iii) promptly to take all action as may from time to time be required
(including (x) complying with all premerger notification, reporting and waiting
period requirements specified in 15 U.S.C. Section 18a and regulations
promulgated thereunder and (y) in the event, under any federal or state law,
prior approval of or notice to any regulatory authority is necessary before the
Option may be exercised, cooperating fully with the Holder in preparing such
applications or notices and providing such information to such regulatory
authority as they may require) in order to permit the Holder to exercise the
Option and Issuer duly and effectively to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant
hereto; and (iv) promptly to take all action provided herein to protect the
rights of the Holder against dilution.

      4.    Exchange. This Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) are
exchangeable, without expense, at the option of the Holder, upon presentation
and surrender of this Agreement at the principal office of Issuer, for other
Agreements providing for Options of different denominations entitling the holder
thereof to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as are
set forth herein, in the aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock
purchasable hereunder. The terms "Agreement" and "Option" as used herein include
any Stock Option Agreements and related Options for which this Agreement (and
the Option granted hereby) may be exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence
reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of
this Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably
satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this
Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new Agreement of like
tenor and date. Any such new Agreement executed and delivered shall constitute
an additional contractual obligation on the part of Issuer, whether or not the
Agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be
enforceable by anyone.

      5.    Adjustment of Shares. In addition to the adjustment in the number of
shares of Common Stock that are purchasable upon exercise of the Option pursuant
to Section 1 of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable
upon the exercise of the Option and the Option Price shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 5. In the event of any
change in, or distributions in respect of, the Common Stock by reason of stock
dividends, split-ups, mergers, recapitalizations, combinations, subdivisions,
conversions, exchanges of shares, distributions on or in respect of the Common
Stock that would be prohibited under the terms of the Merger Agreement, or the
like, the type and number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise
hereof and the Option Price shall be appropriately adjusted in such manner as
shall fully preserve the economic benefits provided hereunder and


                                       6


<PAGE>


proper provision shall be made in any agreement governing any such transaction
to provide for such proper adjustment and the full satisfaction of Issuer's
obligations hereunder.

      6.    Registration Rights. Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent Triggering
Event that occurs prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall, at the
request of Grantee (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any subsequent
holder of this Option (or part thereof) or any of the shares of Common Stock
issued pursuant hereto) delivered within three months of such Subsequent
Triggering Event (or such longer period as provided in Section 10), promptly
prepare, file and keep current a shelf registration statement under the 1933 Act
covering this Option and any shares issued and issuable pursuant to this Option
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement
to become effective and remain current in order to permit the sale or other
disposition of this Option and any shares of Common Stock issued upon total or
partial exercise of this Option ("Option Shares") in accordance with any plan of
disposition requested by Grantee. Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such registration statement first to become effective and thereafter to
remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such
registration statement first becomes effective or such shorter time as may be
reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. Grantee shall
have the right to demand two such registrations. The foregoing notwithstanding,
if, at the time of any request by Grantee for registration of the Option or
Option Shares as provided above, Issuer is in registration with respect to an
underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock, and if in the good faith
judgment of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, or, if none, the
sole underwriter or underwriters, of such offering the inclusion of the Option
or Option Shares would interfere with the successful marketing of the shares of
Common Stock offered by Issuer, the number of Option Shares otherwise to be
covered in the registration statement contemplated hereby may be reduced;
provided, however, that after any such required reduction the number of Option
Shares to be included in such offering for the account of the Holder shall
constitute at least 25% of the total number of shares to be sold by the Holder
and Issuer in the aggregate; and provided further, however, that if such
reduction occurs, then Issuer shall file a registration statement for the
balance as promptly as practicable and no reduction shall thereafter occur. Each
such Holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by Issuer for
inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. If requested by
any such Holder in connection with such registration, Issuer shall become a
party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but
only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations,
warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily included in secondary
offering underwriting agreements for Issuer.

      Upon receiving any request under this Section 6 from any Holder, Issuer
agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to Issuer to be entitled
to registration rights under this Section 6, in each case by promptly mailing
the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the persons entitled to
receive such copies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
in no event shall Issuer be obligated to effect more than two registrations
pursuant to this Section 6 by reason of the fact that there shall be more than
one Grantee as a result of any assignment or division of this Agreement.

      7.    Repurchase Right.


                                       7


<PAGE>


           (a)  (i) Following the occurrence of a Repurchase Event (as defined
below), and following a request of the Holder delivered prior to an Exercise
Termination Event, Issuer (or any successor thereto) shall repurchase the Option
from the Holder at a price (the "Option Repurchase Price") equal to the amount
by which (A) the Market/Offer Price (as defined below) exceeds (B) the Option
Price, multiplied by the number of shares for which this Option may then be
exercised; and (ii) at the request of the owner of Option Shares from time to
time (the "Owner"), delivered no later than 90 days of such occurrence (or such
longer period as provided in Section 10), Issuer shall repurchase such number of
the Option Shares from the Owner as the Owner shall designate at a price (the
"Option Share Repurchase Price") equal to the Market/Offer Price multiplied by
the number of Option Shares so designated.

      The term "Market/Offer Price" shall mean the highest of (i) the price per
share of Common Stock at which a tender offer or exchange offer therefor has
been made, (ii) the price per share of Common Stock to be paid by any third
party pursuant to an agreement with Issuer, (iii) the highest closing price for
shares of Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the
date the Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of the Option or the
Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of Option Shares, as the case
maybe, or (iv) in the event of a sale of all or a substantial portion of
Issuer's assets, the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the
current market value of the remaining assets of Issuer as determined by a
nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the
Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to Issuer, divided by the
number of shares of Common Stock of Issuer outstanding at the time of such sale.
In determining the Market/Offer Price, the value of consideration other than
cash shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm
selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably
acceptable to Issuer.

           (b) The Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its
right to require Issuer to repurchase the Option or any Option Shares pursuant
to this Section 7 by surrendering for such purpose to Issuer, at its principal
office, this Agreement or certificates for Option Shares, as applicable,
accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that the Holder or the Owner,
as the case may be, elects to require Issuer to repurchase the Option and/or the
Option Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7. As promptly
as practicable, and in any event within five business days after the surrender
of the Option and/or certificates representing Option Shares and the receipt of
such notice or notices relating thereto, Issuer shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Holder the Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Owner the
Option Share Repurchase Price therefor or the portion thereof that Issuer is not
then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering.

           (c) To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or
regulation from repurchasing the Option and/or the Option Shares in full, Issuer
shall immediately so notify the Holder and/or the Owner and thereafter deliver
or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Holder and/or the Owner, as
appropriate, the portion of the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share
Repurchase Price, respectively, that it is no longer prohibited from delivering,
within five business days after the date on which Issuer is no longer so
prohibited; provided, however, that if Issuer at anytime after delivery of a
notice of repurchase pursuant to subsection


                                       8


<PAGE>


(b) of this Section 7 is prohibited under applicable law or regulation or
through commencement of regulatory enforcement action from delivering to the
Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the Option Repurchase Price and the
Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in full (and Issuer hereby
undertakes to use its best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal
approvals and to file any required notices as promptly as practicable in order
to accomplish such repurchase), the Holder or the Owner may revoke its notice of
repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares either in whole or to the extent
of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, Issuer shall promptly (i)
deliver to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, that portion of the
Option Repurchase Price or the Option Share Repurchase Price that Issuer is not
prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the
Holder, a new Agreement evidencing the right of the Holder to purchase that
number of shares of Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of
Common Stock for which the surrendered Agreement was exercisable at the time of
delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to
the Holder and the denominator of which is the Option Repurchase Price, or (B)
to the Owner, a certificate for the Option Shares it is then so prohibited from
repurchasing.

           (d) For purposes of this Section 7, a "Repurchase Event" shall be
deemed to have occurred (i) upon the consummation of any merger, consolidation
or similar transaction involving Issuer or any purchase, lease or other
acquisition of all or a substantial portion of the assets of Issuer, other than
any such transaction which would not constitute an Acquisition Transaction
pursuant to the provisos to the final sentence of Section 2(b)(i) hereof or (ii)
upon the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the
then outstanding shares of Common Stock, provided that no such event shall
constitute a Repurchase Event unless a Subsequent Triggering Event shall have
occurred prior to an Exercise Termination Event.

      8.    Substitute Option.

           (a) In the event that prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer
shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person,
other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any
person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, to merge into Issuer and
Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with
such merger, the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be changed into
or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any
other property or the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall after such
merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding voting shares and voting share
equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or
substantially all of its assets to any person, other than Grantee or one of its
Subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such
transaction shall make proper provision so that the Option shall, upon the
consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "Substitute
Option"), at the election of the Holder, of either (x) the Acquiring Corporation
(as hereinafter defined) or (y) any person that controls the Acquiring
Corporation.

           (b)   The following terms have the meanings indicated:


                                       9


<PAGE>


               (1)   "Acquiring Corporation" shall mean (i) the continuing or
      surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with Issuer (if other
      than Issuer), (ii) Issuer in a merger in which Issuer is the continuing or
      surviving person, or (iii) the transferee of all or substantially all of
      Issuer's assets.

               (2)   "Substitute Common Stock" shall mean the common stock
      issued by the issuer of the Substitute Option upon exercise of the
      Substitute Option.

               (3)   "Assigned Value" shall mean the Market/Offer Price, as
      defined in Section 7.

               (4)   "Average Price" shall mean the average closing price of a
      share of the Substitute Common Stock for the one year immediately
      preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no event
      higher than the closing price of the shares of Substitute Common Stock on
      the day preceding such consolidation, merger or sale; provided that if
      Issuer is the issuer of the Substitute Option, the Average Price shall be
      computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by the person
      merging into Issuer or by any company which controls or is controlled by
      such person, as the Holder may elect.

           (c) The Substitute Option shall have the same terms as the Option,
provided, that if the terms of the Substitute Option cannot, for legal reasons,
be the same as the Option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no
event less advantageous to the Holder. The issuer of the Substitute Option shall
also enter into an agreement with the then Holder or Holders of the Substitute
Option in substantially the same form as this Agreement (after giving effect for
such purpose to the provisions of Section 9), which shall be applicable to the
Substitute Option.

           (d) The Substitute Option shall be exercisable for such number of
shares of Substitute Common Stock as is equal to the Assigned Value multiplied
by the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then
exercisable, divided by the Average Price. The exercise price of the Substitute
Option per share of Substitute Common Stock shall then be equal to the Option
Price multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable and the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock
for which the Substitute Option is exercisable.

           (e) In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing subsections, shall
the Substitute Option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of
Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the Substitute Option.

      In the event that the Substitute Option would be exercisable for more than
19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise but
for this subsection (e), the issuer of the Substitute Option (the "Substitute
Option Issuer") shall make a cash payment to the Holder equal to the excess of
(i) the value of the Substitute Option without giving effect to the limitation
in this subsection (e) over (ii) the value of the Substitute Option after giving
effect to the limitation in this subsection (e). This difference in value shall
be determined by a nationally


                                       10


<PAGE>


recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the
case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Acquiring Corporation.

           (f) Issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in
subsection (a) of this Section 8 unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person
that controls the Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all the obligations of
Issuer hereunder.

      9.    Repurchase of Substitute Option.

           (a) At the request of the holder of the Substitute Option (the
"Substitute Option Holder") delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event,
the Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Option from the
Substitute Option Holder at a price (the "Substitute Option Repurchase Price")
equal to the amount by which (i) the Highest Closing Price (as hereinafter
defined) exceeds (ii) the exercise price of the Substitute Option, multiplied by
the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option
may then be exercised, and at the request of the owner (the "Substitute Share
Owner") of shares of Substitute Common Stock (the "Substitute Shares"), the
Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Shares at a price (the
"Substitute Share Repurchase Price") equal to the Highest Closing Price
multiplied by the number of Substitute Shares so designated. The term "Highest
Closing Price" shall mean the highest closing price for shares of Substitute
Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the
Substitute Option Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of the
Substitute Option or the Substitute Share Owner gives notice of the required
repurchase of the Substitute Shares, as applicable.

           (b) The Substitute Option Holder or the Substitute Share Owner, or
both, as the case may be, may exercise its respective right to require the
Substitute Option Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option or the Substitute
Shares, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 9 by surrendering for such
purpose to the Substitute Option Issuer, at its principal office, the agreement
for such Substitute Option (or, in the absence of such an agreement, a copy of
this Agreement) and/or certificates for Substitute Shares accompanied by a
written notice or notices stating that the Substitute Option Holder or the
Substitute Share Owner, as the case may be, elects to require the Substitute
Option Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9. As promptly as practicable,
and in any event within five business days after the surrender of the Substitute
Option and/or certificates representing Substitute Shares and the receipt of
such notice or notices relating thereto, the Substitute Option Issuer shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Substitute Option Holder the Substitute
Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Substitute Share Owner the Substitute
Share Repurchase Price therefor or, in either case, the portion thereof which
the Substitute Option Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and
regulation from so delivering.

           (c) To the extent that the Substitute Option Issuer is prohibited
under applicable law or regulation or through commencement of regulatory
enforcement action from repurchasing the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute
Shares in part or in full, the Substitute Option Issuer following a request for
repurchase pursuant to this Section 9 shall immediately so


                                       11


<PAGE>


notify the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner and
thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the
Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the
portion of the Substitute Option Repurchase Price and Substitute Share
Repurchase Price, respectively, which it is no longer prohibited from
delivering, within five business days after the date on which the Substitute
Option Issuer is no longer so prohibited; provided, however, that if the
Substitute Option Issuer is at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase
pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 9 prohibited under applicable law or
regulation or through commencement of regulatory enforcement action from
delivering to the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner, as
appropriate, the Substitute Option Repurchase Price and the Substitute Share
Repurchase Price, respectively, in full (and the Substitute Option Issuer shall
use its best efforts to receive all required regulatory and legal approvals as
promptly as practicable in order to accomplish such repurchase), the Substitute
Option Holder or the Substitute Share Owner may revoke its notice of repurchase
of the Substitute Option or the Substitute Shares either in whole or to the
extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, the Substitute Option
Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the Substitute Option Holder or the
Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, that portion of the Substitute Option
Repurchase Price or the Substitute Share Repurchase Price that the Substitute
Option Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as
appropriate, either (A) to the Substitute Option Holder, a new Substitute Option
evidencing the right of the Substitute Option Holder to purchase that number of
shares of the Substitute Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of
shares of the Substitute Common Stock for which the surrendered Substitute
Option was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Substitute Option Repurchase Price less
the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the Substitute Option Holder and
the denominator of which is the Substitute Option Repurchase Price, or (B) to
the Substitute Share Owner, a certificate for the Substitute Shares it is then
so prohibited from repurchasing.

      10.   Extension of Certain Periods. The 90-day or three-month period, as
the case may be, for exercise of certain rights under each of Sections 2, 6, 7
and 14 shall be extended: (i) to the extent necessary to obtain all regulatory
approvals for the exercise of such rights (for so long as the Holder, Owner,
Substitute Option Holder or Substitute Share Owner, as the case may be, is using
its reasonable best efforts to obtain such regulatory approval) and for the
expiration of all statutory waiting periods; and (ii) to the extent necessary to
avoid liability under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act by reason of such exercise.

      11.   Issuer Representations and Warranties.  Issuer hereby represents and
warrants to Grantee as follows:

           (a) Issuer has full corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the

Board of Directors of Issuer and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Issuer are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions so contemplated. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed

the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms will have

Common Stock equal to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock at any time
and from time to time issuable hereunder, and all such shares, upon issuance
pursuant hereto, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable, and will be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens,
encumbrance and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights.

      12.   Grantee Representations and Warranties.  Grantee hereby represents
and warrants to Issuer that:

           (a) Grantee has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter

herein, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part
of Grantee. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Grantee.

      13.   Limitation on Total Profit.

           (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no
event shall Grantee's Total Profit (as defined in subsection (c) of this Section
13) exceed $52 million and, if it otherwise would exceed such amount, the
Grantee, at its sole election, shall either (i) reduce the number of shares of
Common Stock subject to this Option, (ii) deliver to the Issuer for cancellation
Option Shares previously purchased by Grantee valued at fair market value at the
time of delivery, (iii) pay cash to the Issuer, or (iv) undertake any
combination thereof, so that Grantee's actually realized Total Profit shall not
exceed $52 million after taking into account the foregoing actions.

           (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Option
may not be exercised for a number of shares as would, as of the date of
exercise, result in a Notional Total Profit (as defined in subsection (d) of
this Section 13) of more than $52 million; provided, that nothing in this
sentence shall restrict any exercise of the Option permitted hereby on any
subsequent date.

           (c) As used herein, the term "Total Profit" shall mean the aggregate
amount (before taxes) of the following: (i) the amount received by Grantee
pursuant to Issuer's repurchase of the Option (or any portion thereof) pursuant

portion thereof) to any unaffiliated party, (v) any equivalent amounts with
respect to the Substitute Option, including pursuant to Section 8(e); and (vi)
the amount of any termination fee actually received by Grantee pursuant to
Section 9.2 of the Merger Agreement. For purposes of this Section 13, references
to Grantee shall be deemed to include references to any affiliate of the
Grantee.

           (d) As used herein, the term "Notional Total Profit" with respect to
any number of shares as to which Grantee may propose to exercise the Option
shall be the Total Profit determined as of the date of such proposed exercise
assuming that the Option were exercised on such date for such number of shares
and assuming that such shares, together with all other Option Shares held by
Grantee and its affiliates as of such date, were sold for cash at the closing
market price for the Common Stock as of the close of business on the preceding
trading day (less customary brokerage commissions).

      14.   Assignment. Neither of the parties hereto may assign any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement or the Option created hereunder to
any other person, without the express written consent of the other party, except
that in the event a Subsequent Triggering Event shall have occurred prior to an
Exercise Termination Event, Grantee, subject to the express provisions hereof,
may assign in whole or in part its rights and obligations hereunder within 90
days following such Subsequent Triggering Event (or such longer period as
provided in Section 10); provided, however, that until the date 15 days
following the date on which the Federal Reserve Board or the OTS, as applicable,
approves an application by Grantee to acquire the shares of Common Stock subject
to the Option (if such approval is required by law), Grantee may not assign its
rights under the Option except in (i) a widely dispersed public distribution,
(ii) a private placement in which no one person acquires the right to purchase
in excess of 2% of the voting shares of Issuer, (iii) an assignment to a single
person (e.g., a broker or investment banker) for the purpose of conducting a
widely dispersed public distribution on Grantee's behalf, or (iv) any other
manner approved by the Federal Reserve Board or the OTS, as applicable.

      15.   Filings. Each of Grantee and Issuer will use its best efforts to
make all filings with, and to obtain consents of, all third parties and
governmental authorities necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation making application
to list the shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder on the New York Stock
Exchange upon official notice of issuance and applying to the Federal Reserve
Board and/or the OTS, as applicable, for approval to acquire the shares issuable
hereunder, but Grantee shall not be obligated to apply to state banking
authorities for approval to acquire the shares of Common Stock issuable
hereunder until such time, if ever, as it deems appropriate to do so.

      16.   Equitable Remedies. The parties hereto acknowledge that damages
would be an inadequate remedy for a breach of this Agreement by either party
hereto and that the obligations of the parties hereto shall be enforceable by
either party hereto through injunctive or other equitable relief.


                                       14

in this Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions and covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired
or invalidated. If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines
that the Holder is not permitted to acquire, or Issuer is not permitted to
repurchase pursuant to Section 7, the full number of shares of Common Stock
provided in Section 1(a) hereof (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1(b) or 5
hereof), it is the express intention of Issuer to allow the Holder to acquire or
to require Issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be
permissible, without any amendment or modification hereof.

constitute one and the same agreement.

      21.   Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of the
parties hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on
its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including
fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, investment bankers,
accountants and counsel.

      22.   Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or
in the Merger Agreement, this Agreement contains the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder and
supersedes all prior arrangements or understandings with respect thereof,
written or oral. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, is intended to confer upon any party, other than the parties hereto,
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as
expressly provided herein.

      23.   Capitalized Terms. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not
defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


           WASHINGTON MUTUAL TO ACQUIRE BANK UNITED FOR $1.5 BILLION;
        COMBINATION TO CREATE LEADING CONSUMER BANKING PLATFORM IN TEXAS

             TRANSACTION EXTENDS WASHINGTON MUTUAL'S POSITION IN THE
                    FAST-GROWING TEXAS RETAIL BANKING MARKET


      SEATTLE, WA AND HOUSTON, TX --AUGUST 21, 2000 -- In a move that will
significantly expand its presence in Texas, Washington Mutual, Inc. (NYSE: WM)
today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Bank United
Corp. (Nasdaq: BNKU) for approximately $1.5 billion. The transaction will create
a $10.7 billion deposit banking operation in Texas and gives Washington Mutual
top-tier market share in three of the four largest metropolitan markets in the
state.

      Under the terms of the agreement, each share of Bank United common stock
will be converted into 1.3 shares of Washington Mutual common stock. Based on
Washington Mutual's closing stock price of $32 13/16 on Friday, August 18, 2000,
the multiple paid is 11.6 times Bank United's trailing 12-month earnings (period
ended June 30, 2000) and 1.67 times Bank United's book value as of June 30,
2000. The transaction, which will be accounted for as a purchase, is immediately
accretive to cash earnings per share and is expected to be accretive to
Washington Mutual on a reported earnings-per-share basis in 2002.

      "This transaction gives Washington Mutual the critical mass to capitalize
on the outstanding growth potential of the Texas market," said Kerry Killinger,
Washington Mutual's chairman, president and CEO.


<PAGE>


      "It's a logical extension of our strategy to become the leading consumer
bank in the nation's most attractive geographic markets. Bank United's strong
market share and branch presence in Texas' leading metropolitan markets
complements the strong positions we currently maintain in the Pacific Northwest,
California and Florida."

      In connection with the transaction, Bank United shareholders will receive
tradable contingent payment right certificates representing the right to receive
the proceeds, if any, received by Bank United or Washington Mutual relating to
the pending forbearance claim against the U.S. government, less related taxes
and expenses. Bank United will establish a trust to manage that litigation and
distribute the proceeds. Also, as part of the transaction, each share of Bank
United's 8 percent corporate premium income equity securities will be converted
into one share of a new series of Washington Mutual's premium income equity
securities with substantially the same terms.

      With nearly 20 million consumers, the Texas economy is the third
largest in the U.S. and its deposit market is the country's fourth largest.
The Texas economy is growing at a rate of 4.6 percent, outpacing the economic
growth of the U.S. as a whole.

      "Like Washington Mutual, Bank United has demonstrated that it can generate
strong loan growth, as well as significantly increase fee income and checking
accounts," Killinger said. "Bank United's success in diversifying its business
over the past few years is highly complementary to our own strategy to re-mix
the balance sheet with higher-yielding consumer, commercial and mortgage banking
assets. This is a great fit."

      Killinger said that by combining Washington Mutual's solid balance sheet,
broad array of products and delivery channels with Bank United's strong Texas
retail franchise, "Washington Mutual will be able to deliver a premier retail
banking alternative to individuals and small- to medium-sized businesses in
Texas.


                                                                               2

      "This transaction is a win-win for the shareholders of both companies and,
with our long track record of successfully integrating substantially larger
companies, we expect to complete this transaction seamlessly," Killinger added.

      In the first nine months of its current calendar year ending June 30, Bank
United generated earnings of $98.3 million, or $2.77 per diluted share, up 17
percent from $78.2 million, or $2.37 per share in the prior year. With 155
branches, Bank United has approximately $8.8 billion in deposits, more than half
of which are lower-cost transaction accounts. Bank United has built a
particularly strong depository banking franchise with market shares of 3.49
percent in Dallas-Fort Worth and 8.16 percent in Houston.

      "We've successfully broken out of the traditional thrift mold and have
become an increasingly important force in one of the leading consumer banking
markets in the nation," said Bank United's President and CEO Barry C.
Burkholder. "We are gratified that, as a result of this transaction, Bank United
shareholders will not only realize the value we've created over the past four
years, but will now also share in the long-term growth of one of the nation's
leading financial institutions -- one that has a history of combining excellent
returns and strong revenue growth with superior credit quality and a solid
balance sheet.

      "We're also very pleased that this transaction will preserve the benefits
of Bank United's interest in its forbearance lawsuit for our shareholders," he
added.

      "Washington Mutual's business approaches, overall strategy and commitment
to delivering shareholder value makes it an excellent partner for Bank United,"
said Lewis S. Ranieri, chairman of Bank United. "I believe that together, the
combined companies will be in an even stronger position to deliver superior
returns to shareholders over the long term."

      Burkholder added, "Our employees, customers and the communities we serve
will all benefit. First, from Washington Mutual's ability to provide the
broadest possible range of products and services to customers; and second,
through Washington Mutual's long-standing commitment to the local communities in
which it operates," Burkholder said. "Equally important, our employees will
benefit from being part of a larger organization that is committed to employees
and their professional development," he added.

      Cost savings as a result of the transaction are estimated to be
approximately $87 million pre-tax in 2002 (fully phased in), or 30 percent of
Bank United's current cost base. The majority of the cost savings are expected
to come from the elimination of duplicate corporate and administrative expenses.

      The companies said that, while approximately 600-650 duplicative positions
are expected to be eliminated as a result of the combination, normal attrition
at Bank United, coupled with Washington Mutual's anticipated company wide growth
and its customary practice of filling vacancies from within, means that fewer
employees will be affected. As a result, most Bank United's employees will be
offered jobs.

      The Boards of Directors of both companies have unanimously approved the
transaction, which is anticipated to close in late 2000 or early 2001, subject
to the approval of Bank United's shareholders and other customary closing
conditions, including regulatory review. Bank United has agreed to pay a
break-up amount of approximately $52 million to Washington Mutual if the
transaction is terminated under certain circumstances. The break-up amount is
payable either in cash or through an exercise of an option to purchase up to
19.9 percent of Bank United's common stock.

      Lehman Brothers acted as financial advisor to Washington Mutual. Goldman
Sachs acted as financial advisor to Bank United.

statements are inherently subject to significant business, economic and
competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our
control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to
assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are

discussed in these forward-looking statements for the reasons, among others,
discussed under the heading "Business-Risk Factors" in Washington Mutual's 1999
Annual Report on Form 10-K, which reasons include: the risk of the interest rate
environment further compressing our margin and adversely affecting our net
interest income; the risk of continued diversification of our assets and adverse
changes to credit quality; competition from other financial services companies
in all our markets; and the concentration of operations in California adversely
affecting our operating results if the California economy or real estate market
declines; the risk of our inability to integrate the operations of Bank United
in an efficient manner and achieve the projected cost savings; and the risk of a
slowdown in the Texas economy that would adversely affect credit quality and
loan origination."
