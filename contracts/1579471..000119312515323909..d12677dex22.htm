Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the MGCL and the DLLCA, at the Merger Effective Time, Company shall be merged
with and into Merger Sub, whereupon the separate existence of Company will
cease, with Merger Sub surviving the Merger (Merger Sub, as the
surviving entity in the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the
"Surviving Entity"), such that following the Merger, the Surviving Entity will
be a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. The Merger shall have the effects
provided in this Agreement and as specified in the MGCL and the DLLCA.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from
and after the Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall possess all
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Merger Sub and
Company, and all of the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of
Merger Sub and Company shall become the claims, obligations, liabilities,
debts and duties of the Surviving Entity.

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place (a) by electronic exchange of documents and signatures at 10:00 a.m.,
New York time, on the third (3rd) business day after the satisfaction or
waiver of the last of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ to
be satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions that, by their nature,
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions at the Closing) or (b) at such other date or place as is
agreed to in writing by Company and Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the Closing would otherwise occur on a date that is within thirty (30) days
prior to the end of Parents then current fiscal quarter, Parent may elect to
defer the Closing to the first (1st) business day after the end of such
fiscal quarter of Parent, subject to Companys consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The date on which the Closing
actually takes place is referred to as the "Closing Date."

 



3 Section 1.3 _Effective Time of Merger_. On the Closing Date, Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall (i) cause articles of merger with respect to the Merger
(the "Articles of Merger") to be duly executed and filed with the State
Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the "SDAT") as provided
under the MGCL, (ii) cause a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger
(the "Certificate of Merger") to be duly executed and filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary") as provided
under the DLLCA and (iii) make any other filings, recordings or publications
required to be made by Company or Merger Sub under the MGCL or DLLCA in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT, and the
Certificate of Merger is accepted by the Delaware Secretary, or on such other
date and time as shall be agreed to by Company and Parent and specified in the
Articles of Merger and in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time being
hereinafter referred to as the "Merger Effective Time").

 

Section 1.4 _Governing Documents_.

 

(a) At the Merger Effective Time, the certificate of formation and the limited
liability company operating agreement of the Surviving Entity shall be
substantially in the form set forth in _Exhibit B_ and _Exhibit C_ ,
respectively, attached hereto.

(b) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause the declaration of
trust, subject to the changes thereto contemplated by _Section 7.20_ and
_Section 7.22_, and the bylaws of Parent to be amended, effective no later
than the Merger Effective Time, to be substantially in the form set forth in
_Exhibit D_ and _Exhibit E_.

(c) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Parent
Operating Partnership Agreement to be amended and restated, effective no later
than the Merger Effective Time, to be in substantially the form of _Exhibit F_
(the "Surviving Operating Partnership Agreement").

Section 1.5 _Tax Treatment of Merger_.

 

(a) The Parties hereby confirm, covenant and agree to treat the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement be, and is hereby adopted as, a plan of reorganization for
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 

(b) Unless otherwise required by a final determination within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code (or a similar determination under applicable
state or local Law), all Parties shall file all United States federal, state
and local Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the intended tax treatment
of the Merger described in this _Section 1.5_, and no Party shall take a
position inconsistent with such treatment.

Section 1.6 _Subsequent Actions_. If at any time after the Merger
Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall determine, in its sole and
absolute discretion, that any actions are necessary or desirable to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Entity its right,
title or interest in, to or under any of the rights or properties of Company
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Entity as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger, then the

 



4  Surviving Entity may take all such actions as may be necessary or desirable
to vest all right, title or interest in, to or under such rights or properties
in the Surviving Entity or otherwise to carry out this Agreement and the
Transactions.

ARTICLE II

Investor Share Count") duly authorized, fully paid, nonassessable and validly
issued Parent Common Shares, subject to adjustment as provided in _Section
2.2(d)_ (all such shares, the "Merger Consideration"), which, at the Merger

with their respective allocations (the "Merger Consideration Allocation") as
set forth, in the case of the Company Investors, on _Schedule III_ hereto and,
in the case of the Designated Recipients, on _Schedule IV_ hereto; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that each Company Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time that is held by Company or any
wholly owned Subsidiary of Company shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto. From and after the Merger

Consideration Allocation set forth on _Schedule III_ may be reallocated
amongst the Company Investors, and the Merger Consideration Allocation set
forth on _Schedule IV_ may be reallocated amongst the Designated Recipients,
as set forth on a revised _Schedule III_ and _Schedule IV_ , respectively,

Dividends and Distributions_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Parent shall (i) pay to the applicable Company Investors
(or to the applicable limited partner or other investor of the applicable
Company Investor designated on _Schedule IV_ , as supplemented from time to
time in accordance with the terms hereof (the "Designated Recipients")),
and/or holders of Company Preferred Shares, as applicable, the (A) amount of
any Fractional Share Consideration due in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_,
and (B) redemption amount for each of the Company Preferred Shares due in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_, which, in the case of each of _clauses
(A)_ and _(B)_ , such Company Investors (and Designated Recipients) and/or
holders of Company Preferred Shares, as applicable, are entitled to receive on
the Closing Date by wire transfer to one or more accounts designated by, or
on behalf of, each such Company Investor and holder of Company Preferred
Shares in writing no later than two (2) business days prior to the Closing
Date, and (ii) electronically issue to each Company Investor (or Designated
Recipient) by way of direct registration in book-entry form Parent Common
Shares representing the number of whole Parent Common Shares into which each
Company Investors Company Shares shall have been converted in accordance
with  _Section 2.1_ (and Parent will subsequently mail, or cause to be
mailed, to each Company Investor (or Designated Recipient) a book-entry
account statement that reflects the Parent Common Shares to which such Company
Investor (or Designated Recipient) is entitled). For the avoidance of doubt,
all dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Shares
that have been declared (in compliance with the terms of this Agreement) but
not paid as of the Closing (and for which the record date is after the
Closing) shall be paid on the payment date for such dividend or other
distribution with respect to the Parent Common Shares constituting the Merger
Consideration (including any Fractional Share Consideration) to
the applicable holders thereof as of such record date.

(b) The Merger Consideration issued and paid in accordance with this _Article
II_  upon conversion of the Company Shares shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company
Shares.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Shares on the records of Company. From and after the Merger Effective Time,
the holders of Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.

 

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Common Shares), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to the number of Parent Common Shares outstanding
after the date

 



6  hereof and prior to the Merger Effective Time so as to provide the holders
of Company Shares with the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event and as so adjusted shall, from and after the
date of such event, be the Merger Consideration.

Section 2.3 _Dissenter s Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, so long as the provisions of Section 3-202(c)(1)(ii) of the
MGCL are applicable to the transaction. 

Section 2.4 _Withholding_. All amounts payable pursuant to this _Article II_
shall be paid without interest (unless otherwise noted). Any payments made
pursuant to this Agreement shall be net of all applicable withholding Taxes
that Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be,
shall be required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law (including
Section 1445 of the Code); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall provide Company with notice at
least ten (10) business days prior to Closing of any proposed withholding and
the Parties shall, to the extent reasonably possible, work together to avoid
or reduce any such withholding obligation. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld by the applicable payor and remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Party in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.5 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, no certificate or scrip representing fractional Parent
Common Shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the Company Shares
pursuant to this _Article II_ , and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder
of Parent. In lieu of any fractional shares, Parent shall pay each holder of
Company Shares, and such holder shall be entitled to receive, an amount in
cash, rounded up to the cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i)
the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account
all Company Shares held at the Merger Effective Time by such holder) would
otherwise be entitled by (ii) the closing price on the NYSE, as reported on
the consolidated tape at the close of the NYSE regular session of trading,
for a Parent Common Share on the last trading day immediately preceding the
Merger Effective Time.

 

Section 2.6 _Further Transfers and Fractional Shares_. The Company and Parent
acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing, the shares constituting
the Merger Consideration shall be transferred (subject to _Section 7.12_),
from time to time, to the beneficial owner of such shares (such direct and
indirect equity holders of the Company Investors, collectively, the "Company
Investor Equity Holders") and if any such transfer(s) would otherwise entitle
any such transferee(s) to receive a fractional share or shares, the Company
Investor and Parent will determine the Fractional Share Consideration into
which such shares should be exchanged (as set forth below). In lieu of any
fractional shares, Parent shall pay to each Company Investor Equity Holder,
and such holder shall be entitled to receive, an amount in cash, rounded up to
the cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional
share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the
closing price on the NYSE, as reported on the consolidated tape at the close
of the NYSE regular session of trading, for a Parent Common Share on the last
trading day immediately preceding the Merger Effective Time, and thereupon,
any previously issued whole shares in lieu of which such Fractional Share
Consideration is paid shall be automatically deemed to have been returned by
the applicable Company Investor to Parent (and Parent shall instruct its
transfer agent to reflect such return).

1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder

the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act")) (such documents and
any other documents filed or furnished by Parent with the SEC, as have been
amended since the time of

 



36  their filing, collectively, the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of their
respective filing dates (or the date of their most recent amendment,
supplement or modification, in each case, to the extent filed prior to the
date hereof), the Parent SEC Documents (i) did not (or with respect to Parent
SEC Documents filed after the date hereof, will not) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii)
complied, or with respect to Parent SEC Documents filed after the date
hereof, will comply, as the case may be, in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case

the SEC thereunder. All of the audited financial statements and unaudited
interim financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents
(including the related notes and schedules thereto) (collectively, the "Parent

prepared from, are in accordance with, and accurately reflect the books and

successor or like form under the Exchange Act), and (D) fairly present, in all
material respects, the financial position and the results of operations,

of the Exchange Act.

subject of ongoing SEC review and Parent has not received any comments from
the SEC with respect to any of the Parent SEC Documents which remain

Section 5.7 _Internal Controls; Sarbanes-Oxley Act; Improper Payments_.

 

(a) Parent and Parent Subsidiaries have designed and maintained a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances (i)
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that transactions
are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorizations, (iii) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements and to maintain asset accountability, (iv)
that access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
general or specific authorization, (v) that the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences and (vi)
accounts, notes and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately,
and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection
thereof on a current and timely basis. Since January 31, 2014, (A) Parent has
designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and

 



37  reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and
is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure, (B) to the knowledge of
Parent, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of
Parent to material information required to be included in Parents periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act (if Parent were required to file such
reports) and (C) to the knowledge of Parent, the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of Parent have disclosed to Parents auditors
and the audit committee of the Parent Board of Trustees (and made summaries of
such disclosures available to Company) (1) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other individuals who have a significant role in
Parents internal controls over financial reporting. Since January 31, 2014,
neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to
any director or executive officer of Parent (as defined in Rule 3b-7
promulgated under the Exchange Act).

(b) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of Parent,
any director, officer or Representative of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has
(i) used any corporate funds for any unlawful contributions, gifts,
entertainment or other unlawful expenses related to political activity, (ii)
made any unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic government official or
employee or (iii) made any unlawful bribe, rebate, payoff, kickback or other
unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic government official or employee,
in each case, in violation in any material respect of any applicable Anti-
Corruption Law. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received any
written communication that alleges that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or
any of their respective Representatives, is, or may be, in violation of, or
has, or may have, any liability under, any Anti-Corruption Law.

 

Section 5.8 _Absence of Certain Changes_.

material respects, their respective businesses in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice.

Statements, (b) for liabilities and obligations incurred since December 31,
2014 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (c)
for liabilities and obligations incurred under this Agreement or in
connection with the Transactions, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has

otherwise) that either alone or when combined with all other liabilities of
a type not described in _clauses (a)_ , _(b)_ or _(c)_ above, has had, or
would reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



38 Section 5.10 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Legal Proceeding
pending against (or to Parents knowledge, threatened against or naming as a
party thereto) Parent, a Parent Subsidiary, any of Parents or any Parent
Subsidiarys respective property, or, to the knowledge of Parent, any
executive officer or director of Parent (in their capacity as such), nor, to
the knowledge of Parent, is there any investigation of a Governmental Entity
pending or threatened against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, other than, in
each of the foregoing cases, as have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that,
notwithstanding the date limitation in this sentence, any such Legal
Proceeding or investigation commenced after the date of this Agreement may be
taken into account when determining whether a Parent Material Adverse Effect
has occurred pursuant to _Section 5.8(b)_). There is no Legal Proceeding
pending against Parent, or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against

event, (A) result in the payment by Parent, Parent Subsidiaries or their
respective ERISA Affiliates of any amount or benefit to a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section

twenty-four (24) hours) notify Company after it or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives has received a Competing Proposal or
inquiry, proposal or offer to enter into or seeking to have discussions or
negotiations with Parent relating to a possible Competing Proposal or the
initial request for non-public information concerning Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries. Such notice to Company shall indicate the identity of the
Person making such request and include the material terms and conditions of
such Competing Proposal inquiry, proposal or offer (including a complete copy
thereof if in writing and any related documents or correspondence).

drafts) or material correspondence with respect thereto and upon the request
of Company shall apprise Company of the status and details of such Competing
Proposal. Parent agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any
agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits Parent
from providing any information to Company in accordance with, or from
otherwise complying with the terms of, this _Section 6.3_.

the Parent Board Recommendation without qualification ( _provided_ , that
Parent Board of Trustees or a committee thereof shall not be obligated to do
so on more than three (3) occasions with respect to a Competing Proposal with
each material modification thereof (including any change in consideration)
being a new Competing Proposal for such purpose (it being understood that, in
each case, Parent stating that it is continuing to negotiate with the Person
that made such Competing Proposal shall not in and of itself constitute an
Adverse Recommendation Change) (each of the actions described in this _clause
(i)_ being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (ii)
authorize, cause or permit Company or Parent or any of their

 



64  respective Subsidiaries to enter into any Competing Acquisition Agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or (iii) take any action
pursuant to  _Section 9.1(e)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, prior to the time the Parent Shareholder Approval is obtained, but not
after, the Parent Board of Trustees may make an Adverse Recommendation Change
and terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ and enter into a
Competing Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Competing Proposal, if and
only if Parent receives a Competing Proposal that was not solicited in, and
did not otherwise result from, breach by Parent of this _Section 6.3_ and
that the Parent Board of Trustees determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel and after obtaining and taking into account the
advice of Parents financial advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in order to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into a Competing Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal:

 

(i) the Parent Board of Trustees shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the trustees duties as
a trustee under applicable Law;

 

(ii) Parent shall have given Company at least five (5) business days prior
written notice of its intention to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_, which notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the basis for the Adverse Recommendation Change
or termination and the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal
and the material terms thereof and include copies of the current drafts of all
material agreements between Parent and the party making such Superior Proposal
and any other material documents or agreements that relate to such Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that such notice or the public
disclosure by Parent of such notice shall not in and of itself constitute an
Adverse Recommendation Change);

 

(iii) Parent shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its Representatives
to negotiate, in good faith with Company during such notice period, to the
extent Company wishes to negotiate; and

(iv) following the end of such notice period, the Parent Board of Trustees
shall have considered in good faith any proposed revisions, modifications or
adjustments to this Agreement and for the Transactions proposed by Company,
and shall have determined (after taking into account any such
proposed revisions, modifications or adjustments), after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and after obtaining and taking into account the
advice of Parents financial advisor that (x) such Superior Proposal giving
rise to the notice in  _sub-clause (e)(ii)_ above continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal and (y) after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the trustees duties
under applicable law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of any
material change to the material terms of such Superior Proposal, Parent shall,
in each case, have delivered to Company an additional notice consistent with
that described in _clause (ii)_ above and the notice period shall have
recommenced (in which case such notice period shall be for three (3) business
days instead of five (5) business days); _provided_ , _further_ , that any
purported termination of 

 



65  this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.3(e)_ shall be void and of no
force and effect, unless Parent termination is in accordance with _Section
9.1(e)_ and Parent pays, or causes to be paid, the Termination Payment in
full to the Company Operating Partnership or such other Person designated by
Company in accordance with _Section 9.2(c)_ prior to or concurrently with
such termination.

 

(f) Nothing in this _Section 6.3_ shall prohibit or restrict the Parent Board
of Trustees, in circumstances not involving or relating to (i) an alternative
transaction with respect to Manager or the Manager Contribution or (ii) a
Competing Proposal and to the extent a Competing Proposal has not been
publicly disclosed, announced or otherwise made public, from effecting an
Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , that, in order to make such
Adverse Recommendation Change, (x) the Parent Board of Trustees determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its
duties as trustees under applicable Law and (y) the provisions in _Section
6.3(e)(ii)_ through _(iv)_ shall apply, mutatis mutandis.

 

(g) Nothing in this _Section 6.3_ shall prohibit the Parent Board of Trustees
from: (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders of Parent a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to Parents shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any other disclosure required under
applicable Law and any disclosure referred to in _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ or
_(iii)_ shall be deemed not to be an Adverse Recommendation Change so long
as (A) any such disclosure includes the Parent Board Recommendation without
any modification or qualification thereof or continues the prior
recommendation of the Parent Board of Trustees, and (B) does not contain
either an express Adverse Recommendation Change or any other statements by or
on behalf of the Parent Board of Trustees which would reasonably be expected
to have the same effect as an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(h) (i) Each of Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that any violation
of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.3_ by any of its respective
Subsidiaries or its or its respective Subsidiaries Representatives, for these
purposes as if such Representatives are subject to the same restrictions and
obligations as those applicable to Company and Parent or its respective
Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach by Company or Parent,
respectively, of this _Section 6.3_ and (ii) Parent acknowledges and agrees
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.3_ by
Manager, its Subsidiaries and Representatives, for these purposes as if
Manager, its Subsidiaries and Representatives are subject to the same
restrictions and obligations as those applicable to Parent, shall be deemed to
be a breach by Parent of this _Section 6.3_.

(i) As used in this Agreement, "Competing Proposal" shall mean any proposal or
offer from any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) or "group",
within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, relating to, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, any (A) acquisition,
sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, license transfer or other
disposition, directly or indirectly, of assets of Parent or Company or any of
their Subsidiaries equal to twenty (20) percent or more of Companys or
Parents consolidated assets or to which twenty (20) percent or more of
Companys or Parents revenues or earnings on a

 



66  consolidated basis are attributable, (B) acquisition of twenty (20) percent
or more of the outstanding Company Shares, Company OP Units or Parent Common
Shares or Parent OP Units, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning twenty (20) percent
or more of the outstanding Company Shares, Company OP Units or Parent Common
Shares or Parent OP Units, (D) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or (E) any combination of the foregoing types of transactions
if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or
earnings, outstanding Company Shares, Company OP Units, Parent Common Shares
or Parent OP Units is involved twenty (20) percent or more, in each case,
other than the Transactions.

(j) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any _bona fide_
 written Competing Proposal arising after the date of this Agreement that was
not the result of a breach by Parent of this _Section 6.3_ and that the
Parent Board of Trustees has determined, after consulting with Parents
outside legal counsel and financial advisor is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms and that if consummated, and taking
into account all financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of the
transaction described in such Competing Proposal, would result in a
transaction more favorable to Parents shareholders from a financial point of
view than the Merger and the other Transactions (including any _bona fide_
written revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Company in
response to such proposal or otherwise), which Competing Proposal, if
consummated, would provide for a combination, acquisition or sale, directly or
indirectly, involving (i) fifty (50) percent or more of Parents consolidated
assets or assets to which fifty (50) percent or more of Parents revenues or
earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, or (ii) fifty (50) percent
or more of the outstanding Parent Common Shares or Parent OP Units.

Section 6.4 _Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the Proxy
Statement. Company shall furnish all information concerning itself, its
affiliates and the holders of its capital stock to Parent and provide such
other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. Parent shall
promptly notify Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and
shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide Company with
copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to
the Proxy Statement received from the SEC and promptly advise Company of any
oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC.
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement
and have such comment cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing (including with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statements), mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each of Company (as applicable) and Parent shall cooperate and
provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response (including the proposed final version of such document
or response) and shall give due consideration to all reasonable changes

 



67  provided by the other Party. Parent shall also use reasonable best efforts
to take any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws
and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of
the Parent Common Shares in the Merger and Company shall furnish all
information concerning Company and Company Investors as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such actions.

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval,
any information relating to Company or Parent, or any of their respective
affiliates, should be discovered by Company or Parent which, in the reasonable
judgment of Company or Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and Company (as
appropriate under the circumstances) and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt
filing by Parent with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement
to, the Proxy Statement and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating
the information contained in such amendment or supplement to shareholders of
Parent. Nothing in this _Section 6.4(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any
Party under _Section 6.4(a)_. For purposes of this _Section 6.4_, any
information concerning or, by its nature, related to Company or its affiliates
will be deemed to have been provided by Company, and any
information concerning or related to the Transactions (other than any
information regarding the transactions effecting the Company Reorganization),
Parent, its affiliates or the Parent Shareholder Meeting will be deemed to
have been provided by Parent.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable, Parent shall, in accordance with applicable
Law and the Parent Governing Documents, establish a record date for, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting solely
for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval (and no other
matters shall be submitted at such meeting unless consented to by the Company
in its sole discretion). Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of Parent entitled
to vote at the Parent Shareholder Meeting and to hold the Parent Shareholder
Meeting as soon as practicable. Parent shall, through the Parent Board of
Trustees, recommend to its shareholders that they give the Parent Shareholder
Approval, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and solicit and
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval,
except to the extent that the Parent Board of Trustees shall have made an
Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section 6.3_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parents obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting shall be unconditional unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and shall not be affected
by any Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 6.4(c)_, if, on a date for which the Parent
Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of Parent Common Shares to obtain the Parent
Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Company may require
Parent, and Parent shall have the right, to adjourn or postpone the Parent
Shareholder Meeting ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Shareholder
Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than
thirty (30) days after the date for which the Parent Shareholder Meeting was
originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by
applicable Law)); _provided_ ,  _further_ ,

 



68  the Parent Shareholder Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned on the date
the Parent Shareholder Meeting is scheduled if Parent shall have received
proxies in respect of an aggregate number of Parent Common Shares, which have
not been withdrawn, such that Parent Shareholder Approval will be obtained at
such meeting.

(d) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to hold the Parent
Shareholder Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement.

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

 

Section 7.1 _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events_.

 

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
Contracts, and subject to the reasonable protocols imposed from time to time
upon advice of counsel, each of Parent and Company shall, and shall cause each
Parent Subsidiary and Company Subsidiary, respectively, to afford to the other
Party and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of their respective
properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and,
during such period, each of Parent and Company shall, and shall cause each
Parent Subsidiary and Company Subsidiary, respectively, to, furnish all
information in its possession (financial or otherwise) concerning its
business, properties and personnel such other Party or its Representatives may
reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Company
shall be required by this _Section 7.1_ to provide the other Party or the
Representatives of the other Party with access to or to disclose information,
(i) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third
party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement and disclosed to the
other Party hereto or entered into on or after the date of this Agreement in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice ( _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or
disclosure), (ii) the disclosure of which would violate any Law or duty (
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that withholding Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure not in violation of any Law or duty) or (iii) that is subject to
any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege (
_provided_ , _however_ , that withholding Party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does
not result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney work product or
other legal privilege, including by means of entry into a customary joint
defense agreement that would alleviate the loss of such privilege). Each of
Parent and Company will use its reasonable best efforts to minimize any
disruption to the businesses of the other Party that may result from the
requests for access, data and information hereunder.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Company will hold, and will cause its Representatives
and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including any information
exchanged pursuant to this _Section 7.1_, in confidence to the extent
required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

notice to Company, (i) of any notice or other communication received by such
Party (A) from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger or the other Transactions, (B) from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person (or another Person) is or may be required in
connection with the Merger or the other Transactions, or (C) of any written
notice received from any Person in connection with (1) any material violation
or default under or notice to terminate, not renew or challenge the validity
or enforceability of any Company Material Contract or Parent Material
Contract, or (2) any event or circumstance that would give rise to any option
to purchase, right of first refusal or first offer, or any other right to
purchase in favor of any Person under any Company Material Contract, Company
Lease, Company Residential Lease, Parent Material Contract, Parent Lease or
Parent Residential Lease, (ii) of any Legal Proceeding commenced or, to
any Partys knowledge, threatened against, such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates or otherwise relating to, involving or affecting
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, in each case in
connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any
other Transaction, and (iii) upon becoming aware of the occurrence or
impending occurrence of any event, change, development or circumstance
relating to it or any Company Subsidiary or Parent Subsidiary, respectively,
which makes or is reasonably likely to make any of the conditions set forth in
_Article VIII_ to not be satisfied. The failure to deliver any such notice, in
and of itself, shall not result in the failure of, or otherwise affect, any
of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_.

Section 7.2 _Consents and Approvals._

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Company and Parent shall and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries, to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other Party in doing, all things necessary, proper and
advisable under applicable Law or pursuant to any Contract to consummate and
make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other
Transactions, including (i) the taking of all actions necessary to cause the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VIII_  to be satisfied, (ii) the
preparing and filing of all documentation to effect all required filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions and applications
and the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
authorizations and approvals from Governmental Entities or other Persons
necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or
to avoid Legal Proceeding by, any Governmental Entity or other Persons
necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions, (iii) the defending of any Legal Proceedings, whether judicial
or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger, or the other Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining Order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed, the avoidance of each and every impediment under any
antitrust, merger control, competition or trade regulation Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the
other Transactions so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 



70 (b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and
Company shall give (or shall cause to be given) any notices to any Person,
and each of Parent and Company shall use, and cause each of their respective
affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents from any
Person not covered by  _Section 7.2(a)_ that are necessary, proper and
advisable to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions. Each of the
Parties will furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with the preparation of any
required governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding
to any inquiry from a Governmental Entity, including promptly informing the
other Party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Entity, and supplying each
other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications
between either Party and any Governmental Entity with respect to this
Agreement. To the extent reasonably practicable, the Parties or their
Representatives shall have the right to review in advance and each of the
Parties will consult the others on, all the information relating to the other
and each of their affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger
and the other Transactions, except that confidential competitively sensitive
business information may be redacted from such exchanges. To the extent
reasonably practicable, neither Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they
permit their respective Representatives to, participate independently in any
meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry
without giving the other Party prior notice of such meeting or conversation
and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, without giving the other Party
the opportunity to attend or participate (whether by telephone or in person)
in any such meeting with such Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, obtaining any approval or consent from any Person pursuant to this
_Section 7.2(b)_ shall not be a condition to the obligations of the Parties
to consummate the Merger.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than
any Governmental Entity) with respect to the Merger and the other
Transactions, none of Company or any Company Subsidiaries, Parent or any
Parent Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, shall be
obligated to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is
being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any accommodation or
commitment or incur any liability or other obligation to such Person, in each
case that is not conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing. Subject to
the immediately foregoing sentence, the Parties shall cooperate with respect
to reasonable accommodations that may be requested or appropriate to
obtain such consents. The Parties acknowledge and agree that no approval or
consent of any such Person is a condition to the obligations of any Party to
effect the Merger.

 

Section 7.3 _Publicity_. The initial press release issued by Parent and
Company concerning this Agreement and the other Transactions shall be a joint
press release, and thereafter Parent and Company shall consult with each other
before issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give each other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on, any press release or other
public statement with respect to the Transactions and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, duties under
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with the
NYSE. Notwithstanding this _Section 7.3_, neither Party shall be required to
consult or obtain the consent of the other Party (i) prior to making
statements or issuing press 

 



71  releases relating to Competing Proposals subject, however, to compliance
with the provisions of _Section 6.3_ of this Agreement, (ii) in the case of
the Company, any statement or press release issued by the Company in response
to any public statement or press release issued by Parent in accordance with
Parents duties and requirements of disclosure as a public and listed company
and with respect to which it did not consult with Company prior to the
issuance and release thereof as permitted pursuant to the prior sentence and
(iii) prior to making statements that are not inconsistent with previous press
release, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent and Company
in compliance with this _Section 7.3_.

Section 7.4 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification._

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and the Parent Operating
Partnership to honor and fulfill in all respects the respective obligations
of Company to the extent permissible under applicable Law, under the Company
Governing Documents (and/or Company OP Governing Documents, as the case may
be), in effect on the date hereof and under any indemnification or other
similar agreements in effect on the date hereof previously made available to
Parent (the "Indemnification Agreements") to the individuals covered by such
Company Governing Documents (and/or Company OP Governing Documents, as the
case may be) Company Subsidiary Governing Documents or Indemnification
Agreements (the "Covered Persons") arising out of or relating to actions or
omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Merger
Effective Time, including in connection with the adoption of this Agreement
and approval of the Transactions.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 7.4(a)_, for a period of six
(6) years after the Merger Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity (in each case, only to the
extent the Covered Persons would be permitted to be indemnified by Company or
any Company Subsidiary under the Company Governing Documents (and/or the
Company OP Governing Documents, as the case may be) or the Company Subsidiary
Governing Documents and applicable Law), to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless
each Covered Person against and from any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or
alleged action or omission in such Covered Persons capacity as such, or (B)
this Agreement and any of the Transactions; and (ii) pay in advance of the
final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation the expenses (including attorneys fees) of any Covered
Person upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Covered Person
to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Covered
Person is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Entity or
the Parent Operating Partnership (1) shall be liable for any settlement
effected without at least one such Persons prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and (2) shall have any
obligation hereunder to any Covered Person to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order
that such indemnification and expense reimbursement is prohibited by
applicable Law, in which case the Covered Person shall promptly refund to
Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Parent Operating Partnership, as
applicable, the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant
hereto.

 



72 (c) For a period of six (6) years after the Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by Company ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent may substitute therefor policies written by carriers with A.M.
Best ratings no lower than the existing policies, providing at least the same
coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous) with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or
events which occurred at or before the Merger Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments
for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the annual
premiums paid as of the date hereof by Company for such insurance (such 300%
amount, the "Base Premium"); _provided_ , _further_ , if such insurance
coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual
premium in excess of the Base Premium, Parent shall maintain the most
advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable for an
annual premium equal to the Base Premium; _provided_ , _further_ , if Company
in its sole discretion elects, then, in lieu of the foregoing insurance,
effective as of the Merger Effective Time, Company may purchase a directors
and officers liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance program for a
period of six (6) years after the Merger Effective Time with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable,
as provided in Companys existing policies as of the date hereof.

 

(d) In the event Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Parent Operating
Partnership or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set
forth in this  _Section 7.4_.

(e) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended third
party beneficiaries of this  _Section 7.4_, and this _Section 7.4_ shall
not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (including
their successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of each of the
Covered Persons (including their successors and heirs) affected thereby.

Section 7.5 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties and their respective boards
of directors (or equivalent) shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or
becomes applicable to the Merger, the Manager Contribution or any of the other
Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to
any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger, the
Manager Contribution and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute or _Section 7.2_ of
Parents Declaration of Trust or of Company charter (collectively the
"Charter Restrictions") on the Merger, the Manager Contribution and the other
Transactions. No Party shall take any action to exempt any Person (other than
the other Parties or their respective affiliates) from any Takeover Statute of
any jurisdiction or the Charter Restrictions that may purport to be
applicable to the Merger, the Manager Contribution or any of the other
Transactions or otherwise cause any restrictions in any Takeover Statute or
the Charter Restrictions not to apply to any such Person, except, in the case
of Parent, in connection with the concurrent termination of this Agreement and
entry into a Competing Acquisition Agreement that constitutes a Superior
Proposal in accordance with _Section 9.1(e)_. 

 



73 Section 7.6 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Company and
Parent, as applicable, shall take all such steps to cause any dispositions of
Company Shares (including derivative securities) or acquisitions of Parent
Common Shares (including derivative securities) resulting from the Merger, the
Manager Contribution and the other Transactions by each individual who is a
director or officer of Company or who will become a director or officer of
Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 7.7 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any Partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either Party, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other Partys operations
prior to the Merger Effective Time (with respect to Company, Company
Operating Partnership, Parent and Parent Operating Partnership), and (b) prior
to the Merger Effective Time, each Party shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
its operations.

Section 7.8 _Security Holder Litigation_. In the event that any Legal
Proceeding related to this Agreement, the Merger, the Manager Contribution or
the other Transactions is brought against Company and/or Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, officers, directors and/or Representatives by
security holders of Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(a "Security Holder Litigation"), the Party against whom such Security Holder
Litigation is brought shall promptly notify the other Party of such Legal
Proceeding and shall keep the other Party informed on a current basis with
respect to the status thereof. The Party against whom such Security Holder

demonstrate compliance with any legal, regulatory or disclosure obligation it
has under the Federal Securities laws or otherwise.

specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made
and, (i) except for the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section 9.2_ and
_Section 11.2_ through _Section 11.15_, which each shall survive such
termination, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void, and (ii)
except as otherwise provided in this _Section 9.2_ or with respect to those
provisions that survive a termination of this Agreement as set forth in
clause (i), there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Parent
Operating Partnership, Merger Sub, Company, Company Operating Partnership or

 



86  the Company Investors; _provided_ , _however_ , that, nothing herein shall
relieve any Party from liability to any other Party, as applicable, for a (i)
Willful Breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination, or (ii) breach of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreement set forth in _Section
7.13_ or  _Section 7.14_ of this Agreement prior to such termination (which
liability the Parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses, any Termination Payment, payments under _Section
9.2_ or out-of-pocket costs).

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
9.1(g)_, then Parent shall pay to Company Operating Partnership or such other
Person designated by Company, on the date of such termination if terminated by
Parent or within two (2) business days of such termination if terminated by
the Company, an amount in immediately available funds set forth on an invoice
provided by the Company to Parent not to exceed $7,000,000 in respect of costs
and expenses incurred by the Company, the Company Investors and/or any of
their Affiliates in connection with the Transactions. 

(c) In the event that:

 

(i)(A) a Competing Proposal shall have been publicly made, proposed or
communicated, after the date hereof and prior to the Parent Shareholder
Meeting (or prior to the termination of this Agreement if there has been no
Parent Shareholder Meeting), and (B) following the occurrence of an event
described in _clause (A)_ above, this Agreement is terminated by Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ (and, in the case of a termination
pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_, the Parent Shareholder Approval shall not have
been obtained) or _Section 9.1(g)_, and (C) within twelve (12) months of the
date of such termination, Parent enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or consummates, any Competing Proposal (substituting "50%" for
"20%" in the definition of Competing Proposal); 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_; or

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(i)_.

 

then, in the case of each of _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ of this _Section
9.2(c)_, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company Operating
Partnership or such other Person designated by Company Operating Partnership,
the Termination Payment, less any amount previously paid pursuant to _Section
9.2(b)_, in accordance with the escrow procedures set forth in _Section
9.2(f)_, (x) in the case of _Section 9.2(c)(ii)_, prior to or simultaneously
with such termination, (y) in the case of only _Section 9.2(c)(i)_, on or
before two (2) business days after the execution of a definitive agreement
with respect to a Competing Proposal, or if earlier, the consummation of a
Competing Proposal, or (z) in the case of _Section 9.2(c)(iii)_, on or before
two (2) business days after the date of any such termination.

(d) In no event shall Parent be (A) required to pay the Termination Payment on
more than one occasion or (B) shall Parent be liable for payments under
_Section 9.2(b)_ and _9.2(c)_ in excess of the Termination Payment plus
interest, and fees and expenses pursuant to _Section 9.2(h)_.

 



87 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to
the proviso of  _Section 9.2(a)_, if a Party provides a notice of
termination and such termination could result in the obligation to pay the
Termination Payment (plus any interest, fees and expenses pursuant to _Section
9.2(h)_), the right to receive such Termination Payment (plus any interest,
fees and expenses pursuant to _Section 9.2(h)_) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company Related Parties against the Parent Related
Parties, for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or
otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not impair the
rights of Company, if any, to obtain injunctive relief and/or specific
performance pursuant to _Section 11.13_ prior to any termination of this
Agreement. Subject to the proviso of _Section 9.2(a)_, upon payment of the
Termination Payment (plus any interest, fees and expenses pursuant to
_Section 9.2(h)_), none of Parent, the Parent Operating Partnership or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or any Parent Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Transactions, except with respect to any obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, and _Section 11.2_ through _Section 11.15_, which
will survive in accordance with the terms thereof. For the avoidance
of doubt, if a Party has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
multiple provisions of this Agreement, such Party may elect under which
provision it is providing notice of termination.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to
the proviso of _Section 9.2(a)_:

 

(i) If Parent is required to pay a Termination Payment or pay the amount
pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_, such payment (in the amount of the Termination
Payment (or the payment under _Section 9.2(b)_, as the case may be, plus, if
applicable, any interest, fees and expenses pursuant to _Section 9.2(h)_
irrespective of the foregoing) shall be paid into escrow on the date such
payment is required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of
same day funds to an escrow account designated in accordance with this
_Section 9.2(f)_, and the amount payable in any taxable year of the
recipient shall not exceed the amount provided in _Section 9.2(f)(ii)_.

(ii) To secure Parents obligation to pay these amounts, as applicable,
Parent shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to such Termination
Payment with an escrow agent selected by Company on such terms (subject to
this _Section 9.2(f)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by Company, Parent
and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of such Termination
Payment pursuant to this _Section 9.2(f)_ shall be made at the time Parent,
as applicable, is obligated to pay such amount pursuant to this _Section
9.2_ by wire transfer of same day funds. The escrow agreement shall provide
that such Termination Payment in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be
released to the Company Operating Partnership, on behalf of Company, or such
other recipient designated by Company, unless the escrow agent receives any
one or combination of the following: (A) a letter from recipients independent
accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow
agent to the recipient, without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the

 



88  Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code ("Qualifying Income")
and the recipient has other income from unknown sources during such year in
an amount equal to 1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying Income (or,
if a higher amount, any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying
Income for such year), in which case the escrow agent shall release such
amount set forth in the independent accountants letter to recipient, or (B) a
letter from recipients counsel indicating that (1) recipient received a
ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the recipient of such
Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code or (2) Companys outside counsel has rendered a reasoned legal
opinion to the effect that the receipt by the recipient of such Termination
Payment should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in
which case the escrow agent shall release the entire amount remaining in the
escrow account to recipient. The Parties agree to amend this _Section 9.2(f)_
at the reasonable request of Company in order to (x) maximize the portion
of such Termination Payment that may be distributed to the recipient
hereunder without causing recipient to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or (y) assist it in obtaining a
favorable ruling or legal opinion from its outside counsel, in each case, as
described in this _Section 9.2(f)_. Any amount of such Termination Payment
that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as
possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing
limitations of this _Section 9.2(f)_. The obligation of Parent to pay any
unpaid portion of the Termination Payment and any payment under _Section
9.2(b)_ shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five
(5) years from the date of Parents deposit into escrow.

(g) Each of the Parties acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in
this _Section 9.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and (ii) neither
any payments under _Section 9.2(b)_ nor the Termination Payment is a penalty,
but rather, in each case, is liquidated damages (but not necessarily in the
full amount of damages that may have been incurred as may thereafter be
awarded) in a reasonable amount that will compensate Company in the
circumstances in which any payments under _Section 9.2(b)_ and/or the
Termination Payment, as the case may be, is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision.

(h) If the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any
amount due pursuant to this _Article IX_ , such Party shall pay interest on
such amount at the annual rate of five (5) percent for the period from the
date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was
actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law. In addition, if Parent fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ or  _Section 9.2(c)_ and, in order to obtain
the payment, the Company commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a
judgment for the payment set forth in this _Section 9.2(b)_ or _Section
9.2(c)_, Parent shall pay the Company (or the Company Operating Partnership,
as may be directed by the Company) its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements) in connection with
such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such payment (as set forth
in the prior sentence) through the date such payment was actually received.

under any such applicable policy ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, resolution
of any such claim against an insurance policy shall not delay payment of any

subsequently recovered under an insurance policy, the Indemnified Party shall
reimburse the Indemnifying Party the amount of such recovery (net of the

thereunder).

 

(b) The indemnity payment hereunder with respect to any Loss shall be

local Taxes (including estimated Taxes) realized by the Indemnified Party as a
result of the event giving rise to such Loss.

(c) The Indemnified Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to

Agreements; Termination of Indemnification_. The representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained herein and in any certificate delivered

_Section 7.4_, respectively, (y) the obligations of Parent and the rights of
a Company Investor set forth in  _Section 7.10(e)_ and (z) agreement and

following Closing, and (ii) pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)(ii)_
(Indemnification by Company Investors) or _Section 10.2(a)(ii)_
(Indemnification by Parent) shall terminate nine (9) months following Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless
shall not terminate with respect to any specific indemnifiable matter as to
which the Indemnified Party shall have, before the expiration of the
applicable period, made an express and valid claim by delivering a notice of
such claim in accordance with _Section 10.5_ (Procedures) to the Indemnifying
Party until such pre-expiration claim has been resolved (including by judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction, settlement, release or otherwise).

Section 10.5 _Procedures_.

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. In order for a Person (the "Indemnified Party") to
be entitled to any indemnification provided for under _Section 10.1_
(Indemnification by Company Investors) or _Section 10.2_ (Indemnification by
Parent) in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any Person
not a party hereto against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"),

Party") in writing of such Third Party Claim (setting forth in reasonable
detail the facts giving rise to such Third Party Claim (to the extent known
or reasonably determinable by the Indemnified Party) and the amount or
estimated amount (to the extent reasonably estimable) of Losses arising out
of, involving or otherwise in respect of such Third Party Claim) within ten
(10) business days after the receipt by such Indemnified Party of written
notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to
give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall
have been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 



93 (b) _Assumption_. If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in or control the
defense thereof and (unless the Indemnifying Party fails to actively defend
such Third Party Claim), if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such counsel is not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance
with this _Section 10.5(b)_, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. Any such
participation or assumption shall not constitute a waiver by any party of any
attorney-client privilege in connection with such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance
with this _Section 10.5(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, at its own expense unless
representation of both Parties by the same counsel would represent a conflict
of interest for such counsel under applicable standards of professional
conduct for attorneys, in which case the Indemnifying Party will pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel (selection not to be unreasonably
objected to by the Indemnifying Party); provided that in no event shall the
Indemnifying Party be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than
one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to local counsel in each relevant
jurisdiction), it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control
such defense. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses
of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying
Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the Indemnified
Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
reasonable cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying
Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making
employees available at such times and places as may be reasonably
necessary to defend against such Third Party Claim for the purpose of
providing additional information, explanation or testimony in connection with
such Third Party Claim. In any Third Party Claim, the party responsible for
the defense of such claim shall, to the extent reasonably requested by the
other party, keep such party informed as to the status of such claims,
including all settlement negotiations and offers. If notice is given to an
Indemnifying Party of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section
10.5(b)_ and the Indemnifying Party does not, within twenty (20) business days
after such notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its
election to defend such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not thereafter be
entitled to assume the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall defend such Third
Party Claim diligently to final conclusion or settlement of such Third
Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not
settle such Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party
unless such settlement (i) does not involve any finding or admission of any
violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any Indemnified Party and
would not reasonably be expected to have any adverse effect on any other
claims arising out of the same matter that may be made against any Indemnified
Party, (ii) does not involve any relief other than monetary damages that are
paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and (iii) completely, finally and
unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party in connection

 



94  with such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim
(and shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the
Indemnified Party in defending such Third Party Claim) if (i) the Third Party
Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief or relief other than
monetary damages for which the Indemnified Party would be entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement or may otherwise adversely affect the
Indemnified Party or (ii) the Third Party Claim is a criminal, civil or
administrative proceeding, or relates to such a proceeding, or the underlying
facts or circumstances of which could reasonably be expected to give rise to
such a proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that, no settlement of any such
claim or action shall be entered into, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) cause, or agree to, the waiver of the attorney-client
privilege, attorney work-product immunity or any other privilege or protection
in respect of confidential legal memoranda and other privileged materials
drafted by, or otherwise reflecting the legal advice of, internal or outside
counsel of an Indemnified Party (the "Subject Materials") relating to such
Third Party Claim. Each party hereto mutually acknowledges and agrees, on
behalf of itself and its affiliates, that (i) each shares a common legal
interest in preparing for the defense of Legal Proceedings, or potential Legal
Proceedings, arising out of, relating to or in respect of any actual or
threatened Third Party Claim or any related claim or counterclaim, (ii) the
sharing of Subject Materials will further such common legal interest and (iii)
by disclosing any Subject Materials to and/or sharing any Subject Materials
with the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall not waive the
attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product immunity or any other
privilege or protection. The Indemnified Party shall not be required to make
available to the Indemnifying Party any information that is subject to an
attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege that based on the advice
of outside counsel would be impaired by such disclosure or any
confidentiality restriction under applicable Law.

(d) _Other Claims_. In the event any Indemnified Party has a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under _Section 10.1_ (Indemnification by Company
Investors) or _Section 10.2_ (Indemnification by Parent) that does not
involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of
such claim to the Indemnifying Party (setting forth in reasonable detail the
facts giving rise to such claim (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party)
and the amount or estimated amount (to the extent reasonably estimable) of
Losses arising out of, involving or otherwise in respect of such claim)
promptly after becoming aware of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that
failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have
been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) business days
following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes
its liability to the Indemnified Party under _Section 10.1(a)_ (the
"Response Period") or _Section 10.2(a)_ (a "Claim Response"), such claim
specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively
deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the
case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof)
is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such
portion thereof) becomes finally determined. If the

 



95  Indemnifying Party delivers a Claim Response within the Response Period
indicating that it disputes one or more of the matters identified in the
claims notice, then the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
promptly meet and use their reasonable efforts to settle the dispute. If
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are unable to reach agreement
within 30 days after the conclusion of the Response Period, then either
the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party may resort to other legal
remedies, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article X_.

 

(e) _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, the rights and remedies set forth
in this _Article X_ shall be the sole and exclusive rights and remedies of
the Company Investor Indemnitees and Parent Indemnitees under or in connection
with this Agreement, except that nothing in this Agreement will limit any
right to injunctive or other equitable relief or limit any rights or remedies
with respect to fraud.

Section 10.6 _Release_. Effective as of the Merger Effective Time, each
Company Investor (individually, a "Releasor" and collectively, "Releasors"),
hereby releases and forever discharges the Surviving Entity, Parent (in its
capacity as an affiliate of the Surviving Entity) and each of
their respective Subsidiaries, and each of their respective individual, joint
or mutual, past, present and future Representatives, successors and assigns
(individually, a "Releasee" and collectively, "Releasees") from any and all
claims, demands, Legal Proceedings, causes of action and Orders that any of
the Releasors now have, have ever had or may hereafter have against the
respective Releasees, and from any and all obligations, Contracts, debts,
liabilities and obligations that any Releasee now has, has ever had or may
hereafter have in favor of any of the Releasors, in each case of any nature
(whether absolute or contingent, asserted or unasserted, known or unknown,
primary or secondary, direct or indirect, and whether or not accrued) arising
contemporaneously with or before the Merger Effective Time or on account of or
arising out of any matter, cause or event occurring contemporaneously with or
before the Merger Effective Time, including any rights to indemnification or
reimbursement, whether pursuant to their respective certificate of
incorporation or by-laws (or comparable documents), Contract or otherwise and
whether or not relating to claims pending on, or asserted after, the Merger
Effective Time (in each case other than any obligations of Parent or the
Surviving Entity arising under this Agreement or otherwise arising in
connection with the Merger or the other Transactions) (collectively, the
"Released Claims"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing release shall
not cover claims arising from the Non-Released Matters. "Non-Released Matters"
shall mean rights of the Releasors (i) under this Agreement, including, for
the avoidance of doubt under _Article II_ , _Section 7.4_, _Section 10.2_
and _Section 11.3_) or the Registration Rights Agreement or otherwise arising
in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions. Effective as of the
Merger Effective Time, each Releasor hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain
from, directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or commencing,
instituting or causing to be commenced, any Legal Proceeding of any kind
against any Releasee, based upon any Released Claim.

indicated or the context otherwise requires. All references herein to the
Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect
Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context
otherwise requires. The Parties agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore,
waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed
against the party drafting such agreement or document. Any Law defined or
referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of statutes) by succession of

 



111  comparable successor Laws. References to a Person are also to its successors
and permitted assigns. All references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of
the United States of America (unless otherwise expressly provided herein).
The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of

is the intent of the Parties that each representation, warranty, covenant,
condition and agreement contained in this Agreement shall be given
full, separate, and independent effect and that such provisions are
cumulative. The phrase "ordinary course of business" shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "consistent with past practice" whether or not such
words actually follow such phrase. Any reference in this Agreement to a date
or time shall be deemed to be such date or time in the City of New York, New

executed counterpart of this Agreement.

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent

thereof and supersede all other prior agreements (except that the

Parent Operating Partnership and Merger Sub shall be permitted to take the
actions contemplated by this Agreement) and understandings, both written and

remedies hereunder.

 



112 Section 11.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal

modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Merger is
fulfilled to the extent possible.

in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 11.3_. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted
by Law.

MERGER AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _Section 11.11_.

 



113 Section 11.12 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other Party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) Parent and
one or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or (iii)
one or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent. Subject to
the preceding sentence, but without relieving any Party of any obligation
hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 11.13 _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and
the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Except as set forth in this
_Section 11.13_, including the limitations set forth in _Section 11.13(c)_
and _Section 11.13(d)_, it is agreed that in the event of a breach prior to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ , the non-breaching
Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement by any other Party and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 11.13(b)_, it is acknowledged and agreed
that Company shall be entitled to specific performance of Parents obligation
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to consummate the Merger only in the
event that each of the following conditions have been satisfied: (i) all of
the conditions in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2 _have been satisfied and
(ii) Parent, Parent Operating Partnership and Merger Sub have failed to
complete the Closing in accordance with _Section 1.2_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding _Section 11.13(b)_, it is acknowledged and agreed that
Parent shall be entitled to specific performance of Companys obligation
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to consummate the Merger only in the
event that each of the following conditions have been satisfied: (i) all of
the conditions in _Section 8.1_ and  _Section 8.3_ have been satisfied and
(ii) Company has failed to complete the Closing in accordance with _Section
1.2_.

 

(e) The Parties right to obtain specific performance is an integral part of
the Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to the grant of
the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches
of this Agreement by any other Party (including any objection on the basis
that there is an adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity),
and each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to

 



114  enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party under
this Agreement, all in accordance with the terms of this _Section 11.13_. In
the event any Party seeks an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, such Party shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with such order or injunction, all in accordance with
the terms of this _Section 11.13_. In the event that a Party initiates a
proceeding seeking equitable relief pursuant to this _Section 11.13_, the
Outside Date shall automatically be extended until such proceeding is finally
resolved.

Section 11.14 _Waiver of Conflicts_.

 

(a) Parent agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of any of its Subsidiaries
and affiliates, that, following the Closing, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP ("Skadden") and Clifford Chance LLP ("Clifford Chance") may serve as
counsel to the Company Investors and their affiliates in connection with any
matters related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the "Relevant Matters") notwithstanding any representation by
Skadden and Clifford Chance prior to the Closing of the Company and/or any of
the Company Subsidiaries. Parent and the Surviving Entity (on behalf of itself
and the Company Subsidiaries) hereby, effective as of the Closing (a) waive
any claim they have or may have that either Skadden and Clifford Chance has a
conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such
representation and (b) agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after
the Closing between Company Investors or any of its affiliates, on the one
hand, and Parent or any of its affiliates, on the other hand, in connection
with the Relevant Matters, Skadden and Clifford Chance may represent the
Company Investors or any of its affiliates in such dispute even though the
interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Parent or the Surviving
Entity and even though Skadden and Clifford Chance may have represented the
Surviving Entity or the Company Subsidiaries in a matter substantially
related to such dispute. Parent represents that Parents own attorney has
explained and helped Parent evaluate the implications and risks of waiving the
right to assert a future conflict against Skadden and Clifford Chance, and
Parents consent with respect to this waiver is fully informed. Parent (on
behalf of itself, the Surviving Entity and the Company Subsidiaries) also
further agrees that, as to all communications among Skadden and/or Clifford
Chance and Parent, the Surviving Entity, the Company Subsidiaries, and the
Company Investors or any of its affiliates and Representatives, that relate in
any way to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Privileged Communications"),
the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs
to the Company Investors and may be controlled by the Company Investors and
will not pass to or be claimed by Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates or Representatives.
In addition, all of the client files and records in the possession of Skadden
and Clifford Chance related to this Agreement and the Transactions, and that
constitute Privileged Communications will continue to be property of (and be
controlled by) the Company Investors; _provided_ , that, to the extent that
any such files or other materials which relate to any matter with respect to
which counsel was engaged by the Surviving Entity or any Company Subsidiary
and contain information that does not relate to the negotiation, documentation
and consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, such
information shall remain with Parent and the Surviving Entity. Notwithstanding
the foregoing,

 



115  (x) nothing shall limit, and the Company Investors agree, in its own
capacity and on behalf of the Company Investor Equity Holders, not to object
to, Skadden and/or Clifford Chance representing Parent or Surviving Entity
and its respective Subsidiaries at any time and shall not raise or assert any
conflict of interest or any other objection to such representation and (y) in
the event that a dispute arises between Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and a third party other than a party to this Agreement after the
Closing, Company and the Company Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of Privileged Communications by Skadden and
Clifford Chance or any of the Company Investors to such third party.

Section 11.15 _Parent Operating Partnership Guarantee of Certain Excluded
Business Separation Agreement Obligations_. Effective as of the Merger
Effective Time, the Parent Operating Partnership hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the due and punctual payment of all
payment obligations of the Company Group (as defined in the Excluded Business
Separation Agreement) under or in connection with the Excluded Business
Separation Agreement as any such obligation may, from time to time, become due
and payable thereunder or with respect thereto. The Parent Operating
Partnership acknowledges that the foregoing guarantee is one of payment, not
collection or collectability, and such guarantee obligation is primary without
requirement of presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance or
other notice of any kind.
