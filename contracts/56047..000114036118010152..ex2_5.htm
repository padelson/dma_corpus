accounting firm of national standing, that has no material relationships with
any of the Parties, jointly selected by Buyer and the Equityholders'

Arbitrator shall be bound by the principles set forth in this Section 2.4. The
Accounting Arbitrator resolution shall be based solely on presentations and
supporting material provided by the Parties and not pursuant to any
independent review, shall not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or the Equityholders'
Representative or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
Buyer or the Equityholders' Representative. Such report shall be final and
binding upon all of the Parties to this Agreement. Upon the agreement of Buyer
and the Equityholders' Representative or the decision of the Accounting
Arbitrator, or if the Equityholders' Representative fails to deliver written
notice of disagreement to Buyer within the forty-five (45) day period provided
in Section 2.4(c), the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as adjusted (if

final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement for purposes of this Section 2.4
(the " _Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement_ ") and shall be deemed to

respectively, in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the
disputed items submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator by such Party that are
unsuccessfully disputed by such Party (as finally determined by the Accounting
Arbitrator) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of disputed items submitted
by Buyer and the Equityholders' Representative.

Indebtedness, _plus_ the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses by an amount

Positive Purchase Price Adjustment Amount_ "), then Buyer shall pay the Net
Positive Purchase Price Adjustment Amount in cash in accordance with Section

Representative shall deliver a Joint Direction instructing to the Escrow Agent
to make payment of such amount out of the Adjustment Escrow Account in

Capital, _plus_ the Final Closing Cash, _minus_ (B) the sum of the Final
Closing Funded Indebtedness, _plus_ the Final Closing Transaction Expenses by
an amount greater than $500,000 (such excess plus $500,000, the " _Net
Negative Purchase Price Adjustment Amount_ "), then Buyer shall be entitled to
receive a payment in cash out of the Adjustment Escrow Account in an amount
equal to the lesser of the Net Negative Purchase Price Adjustment Amount and
the Adjustment Escrow Amount, and Buyer and the Equityholders' Representative
shall deliver a Joint Direction instructing the Escrow Agent to make a payment
to Buyer in an amount equal to the lesser of the Net Negative Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount. Recovery from the
Adjustment Escrow Account shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect
to any claims arising out of or relating to the Net Negative Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount and neither Buyer nor the Constituent Companies, Largus or
any of their respective Affiliates shall have any claim against any
Equityholder in respect thereof. In addition, if the amount of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount is greater than the Net Negative Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount, then Buyer and the Equityholders' Representative shall deliver a Joint
Direction instructing the Escrow Agent to make an aggregate payment equal to
the difference between the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Net Negative
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount for distribution in accordance with Section
2.4(h) to the account of each Equityholder as designated by the Equityholders'
Representative and by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

Purchase Price Adjustment is $500,000 or less and (ii) Section 2.4(f) that the

Equityholders' Representative shall deliver a Joint Direction instructing the
Escrow Agent to make an aggregate payment equal to the amount then held in the
Adjustment Escrow Account for distribution in accordance with Section 2.4(h)
to the account of each Equityholder as designated by the Equityholders'
Representative and by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

  


 

  

(h) Within two (2) Business Days following determination of the Final Purchase
Price Adjustment Statement, Buyer shall pay the Net Positive Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount, if any, and/or Buyer and the Equityholders' Representatives
shall cause the Escrow Agent to promptly pay from the Adjustment Escrow
Account pursuant to the last sentence of Section 2.4(e), Section 2.4(f) or
Section 2.4(g), as applicable, to each Equityholder, an amount equal to the
sum of (A) such Equityholder's Applicable Portion of the Net Positive Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount, if any, _plus_ (B) such Equityholder's Applicable
Portion of the Adjustment Escrow Release Amount.

  


 

  

(i) The Parties hereto agree to treat any payment made pursuant to this

All issued and outstanding Equity Securities of Largus are duly authorized,
have been validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, have not been
issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights and were issued in
compliance with applicable securities Laws or exemptions therefrom. Except as
set forth on Section 4.24(c) of the Constituent Company Disclosure Schedule,
at the close of business on the date hereof, no shares of capital stock or
other Equity Securities of Largus were issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding. Largus has no outstanding options or other securities convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of its Equity Securities or
any rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any agreements providing for
the issuance (contingent or otherwise) of any shares of its Equity Securities.
Largus is not a Party to any right of first refusal, right of first offer,
proxy, voting agreement, voting trust, registration rights agreement or
stockholders agreement with respect to the sale or voting of any Equity
Securities of Largus, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any Equity Securities of Largus.

  


 

  

(d) _Holding Company; No Subsidiaries_. Largus does not engage in, and has
never engaged in, any business activities other than (i) its ownership of the
Acquired Equity Securities, (ii) activities in connection with this Agreement
and the Contemplated Transactions and (iii) engaging in transactions related
to its capital stock, in each case including any activities related or
incidental thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Largus
(A) has no, and has never had any, employees, (B) does not own, operate or
lease, and has never owned, operated or leased, any real property or personal
property and (C) has no Liabilities, except for Liabilities incurred in
connection with (w) this Agreement, (x) the activities set forth in clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) of the first sentence of this Section 4.24(d), (y) Taxes
or (z) obligations to indemnify officers and directors and other Liabilities,
of a type and in amounts, typically incurred by holding companies that do not
have and have never had any operations, in each case none of which matters set
forth in this clause (C) are, individually or in the aggregate, material.
Largus has no Subsidiaries, and owns no Equity Securities in any Person other
than Equity Securities in the Constituent Companies as set forth in Section
4.24(c) of the Constituent Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

 

43  

  

(e) _No Violation_. The execution and delivery by Largus of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents to which Largus is a Party, the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions by Largus and compliance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which Largus is a Party will not (i)
conflict with or violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of Largus, (ii) conflict with or violate any Law or Order applicable to
Largus or by which its properties are bound or affected, (iii) violate or
result in a breach of or constitute a default under, or require the consent of
any third party under, or result in or permit the termination or amendment of
any provision of, or result in or permit the acceleration of the maturity or
cancellation of performance of any obligation under, or result in the creation
or imposition of any Lien (other than any Permitted Lien) of any nature
whatsoever upon any assets or property or give to others any interests or
rights therein under, any material Contract to which Largus is a Party or
bound or (iv) result in the creation of, or require the creation of, any
material Lien upon any Equity Securities of Largus.

  


 

  

(f) _Governmental Authorizations and Consents_. No Governmental Consents are
required to be obtained or made by Largus in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary Documents to which
Largus is, or is to be, a Party or the consummation by Largus of the
Contemplated Transactions, except for those Governmental Consents for which
the failure to obtain such Governmental Consents would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be material to Largus, or its ability to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions.

  


 

  

(g) _Litigation_. There is no Litigation pending or, to the Knowledge of
Largus, threatened in writing, against Largus, at law or in equity before any
Governmental Authority; and to the Knowledge of Largus there is no Order to
which Largus is subject.

  

  

 

44  

  

(h) _Tax Matters_. All Tax Returns that are required to be filed on or before
the date hereof for, by, on behalf of or with respect to Largus have been
timely filed (or caused to be filed) in accordance with applicable Law (taking
into account any applicable extension of time to file) with the appropriate
Taxing Authority on or before the date hereof, and all such Tax Returns are
true, complete and correct in all respects. All Taxes due and owing under
applicable Laws by Largus (whether or not shown to be due and payable on any
Tax Return) have been paid in full. Neither Largus nor any Person on behalf of
Largus has requested any extension of time within which to file any Tax
Return, which Tax Return has not been filed. Largus is not under audit or
examination by any Taxing Authority, or subject to any Tax Proceeding, no
written notice of such an audit, examination or Tax Proceeding has been
received by Largus, no claims or assessments for or relating to Taxes have
been made against Largus, and, to the Knowledge of Largus, no audits,
investigations or claims or assessments for or relating to Taxes have been
threatened against Largus by any Taxing Authority. Largus has withheld or
collected and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority all Taxes required
by applicable Law to be withheld or collected, including withholding of Taxes
pursuant to Sections 1441 through 1464, 3401 through 3406, 6041 and 6049 of
the Code and similar provisions under any state, local or foreign Law, and
Largus has properly received and maintained any and all certificates, forms
and other documents required by applicable Law for any exemption from
withholding and/or remitting any Taxes. Largus has not agreed to any extension
or waiver of the statute of limitations applicable to any Tax, or agreed to
any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, which
period (after giving effect to such extension or waiver) has not yet expired.
Except for Permitted Liens, there are no Liens for unpaid Taxes on the assets
of Largus and no claim for unpaid Taxes has been made by any Taxing Authority
that could give rise to any such Lien. Largus is not, and has never been, a
member of an "affiliated group" of corporations within the meaning of Section
1504 of the Code and has no liability for Taxes of any Person under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law), or as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.
Largus is not a party to, is not bound by, and has no obligation under any Tax
allocation agreement, Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnity obligation or
similar arrangement with respect to Taxes, including any advance pricing
agreement, closing agreement, compromise, ruling or other agreement with any
Taxing Authority that relates to the assessment or collection of Taxes (other
than pursuant to customary provisions in commercial agreements not primarily
related to Taxes). No claim has ever been made by any Taxing Authority in a
jurisdiction where Largus does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Largus has not distributed stock of
another Person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person, in a
transaction that was purported or intended to be governed by Section 355 of
the Code. Largus has not engaged in any "listed transaction," as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). Largus is, and at all
times since its formation or organization has been, classified as a
corporation for U.S. federal Tax purposes within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 301.7701-2(b)(1). Largus will not be required to include
any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income
for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a
result of any (i) change in the method of accounting for a taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) "closing agreement" as described
in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of
state, local or foreign income Tax Law) executed prior to the Closing, (iii)
intercompany transaction or excess loss account described in the Treasury
Regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 1502 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law)
undertaken prior to the Closing, (iv) installment sale or open transaction
disposition made prior to the Closing, or (v) prepaid amount received prior to
the Closing.

  


 

  

(i) _No Brokers_. Largus has not employed or incurred any Liability to any
broker, finder or agent for any brokerage fees, finder's fees, commissions or
other amounts with respect to this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the
Contemplated Transactions.

EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. BUYER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE III AND THIS ARTICLE IV, BUYER IS
ACQUIRING THE ACQUIRED EQUITY SECURITIES ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS. THE
DISCLOSURE OF ANY MATTER OR ITEM IN ANY SCHEDULE HERETO WILL NOT BE DEEMED TO

5.2. _Authorization and Enforceability_.

  


 

  

The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to
which Buyer is a party and the performance by Buyer of the Contemplated

proceedings on the part of Buyer (including, without limitation, any
stockholder vote or approval) are necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to
which Buyer is a party or the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.
This Agreement is, and each of the Ancillary Documents to be executed and
delivered at the Closing by Buyer will be at the Closing, duly authorized,
executed and delivered by Buyer, and constitute, or as of the Closing Date
will constitute, valid and legally binding agreements of Buyer enforceable in
accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization
and other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors'
rights and to general equity principles.

  

  

 

46  

  

5.3. _No Violation_.

  


 

  

The execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents to which Buyer is a Party, consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions and compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents to which Buyer is a Party will not (a) conflict with or violate any
provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar
organizational documents of Buyer, or (b) assuming that all consents,
approvals and authorizations contemplated by Section 5.4 have been obtained,
conflict with or violate in any material respect any Law applicable to Buyer
or by which their respective properties are bound or affected. Neither Buyer
nor its Affiliates are subject to any Contract that would materially impair or
delay Buyer's ability to consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

  


 

  

5.4. _Governmental Authorizations and Consents_.

  


 

  

No Governmental Consents are required to be obtained or made by Buyer in

Transactions, except for those Governmental Consents listed in Section 4.5 of

to any Governmental Authority in connection with any Governmental Consents
shall be true and correct.

costs of Buyer arising from the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

condition to Buyer's obligation to consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

  


 

  

5.7. _Investment Purpose_.

economic risk of holding its investment in the Constituent Companies for an

knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable
of evaluating the merits and risk of its investment.

would constitute a liability of the Equityholders.

  


 

  

5.9. _No Inducement or Reliance; Independent Assessment_.

  


 

  

(a) Buyer has not been induced by and has not relied upon any representations,
warranties or statements, whether express or implied, including any implied
warranty of merchantability or of fitness for a particular purpose, made by
the Constituent Companies, their Subsidiaries, Largus, or any of the
Equityholders or their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
agents or representatives that are not set forth in this Agreement and the

statements were made in writing or orally. Buyer represents and warrants that

representation or warranty, express or implied, oral or written, including any
implied warranty of merchantability or of fitness for a particular purpose, as

Company Disclosure Schedule), and neither the Constituent Companies, nor
Largus, nor any of the Equityholders, nor any of their respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives, will have or be
subject to any liability to Buyer or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to Buyer or its representatives, or the use by Buyer or its
representatives, of any information, including publications, any confidential

the Contemplated Transactions, Buyer has relied on the results of its own
independent review, investigation and analysis.

Documents, Buyer acknowledges that none of the Constituent Companies, their
Subsidiaries, Largus, the Equityholders nor any of their respective
representatives or Affiliates makes, will make or has made any representation
or warranty, express or implied, including as to the prospects of the
Constituent Companies or any of their Subsidiaries or Largus or any of their
respective businesses or their profitability for Buyer, or with respect to any
forecasts, projections or business plans made available to Buyer (or its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives) in
connection with Buyer's review of the Constituent Companies, their
Subsidiaries and Largus.

Subject to applicable Laws, during the period from the date hereof through the

pursuant to Article VIII, the Constituent Companies, their Subsidiaries and
Largus shall provide Buyer and its representatives reasonable access during
regular business hours to all offices, facilities, assets, books and records
of the Constituent Companies, their Subsidiaries and Largus as Buyer may
reasonably request, including the right to inspect the Vessels and conduct or
cause to be conducted surveys of the Vessels; _provided_ , that (a) Buyer and
its representatives shall take such action as is deemed necessary in the
reasonable judgment of the Constituent Companies, their Subsidiaries or Largus
to schedule such access and visits through a designated officer of the party
providing access and in such a way as to avoid disrupting in any material
respect the normal business of the party providing access, (b) neither the
Constituent Companies nor their Subsidiaries nor Largus shall be required to
take any action which would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or
other privilege or would compromise such party's confidential information, (c)
the Constituent Companies and their Subsidiaries and Largus need not supply
Buyer with any information which, in the reasonable judgment of the
Constituent Companies and Largus, the Constituent Companies, any of their
Subsidiaries or Largus are under a contractual or legal obligation not to
supply and (d) in no event shall Buyer be permitted to conduct any sampling of
any environmental media, including soil, sediment, groundwater, surface water,
indoor or outdoor air or building material. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall
not (and shall cause its Subsidiaries, representatives and Affiliates not to)
use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.2 for any purpose
unrelated to the Contemplated Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, any
information provided or made available in connection with such access pursuant

Information" or "Confidential Information," as applicable, in accordance with
the terms and subject to the conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  


 

  

6.3. _Efforts; Regulatory Filings_.

  


 

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Contemplated Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all
necessary Governmental Consents and all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties and (ii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Contemplated Transactions
and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement as soon as reasonably
practicable. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Parties shall take or
agree to take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in any of
the conditions set forth in Article VII not being satisfied or to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

  

  

 

51  

  

(b) Each of Buyer, the Constituent Companies and Largus shall (i) respond as
promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests received from the FTC,
the Antitrust Division, any state attorney general or other Governmental
Authority in connection with the Contemplated Transactions; (ii) not enter
into any agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
Governmental Authority which prohibits the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the other Parties
hereto, (iii) promptly notify the other Party of any material communication to
that Party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any state attorney general or
any other Governmental Authority in respect of any investigation, inquiry or
other proceeding relating to the Contemplated Transactions and, subject to
applicable Law, discuss with and permit the other Party (and its counsel) to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the other Party's reasonable
comments in connection with any proposed written communication to any of the
foregoing; (iv) not initiate, participate or agree to participate in any
substantive meeting, telephone call, or discussion with any Governmental
Authority concerning this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions unless it
consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat; and (vi) act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with
the other Party in connection with resolving any investigation or other
inquiry of any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions.

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.3, Buyer shall not
be required to proffer or consent to a governmental Order providing for the
sale or other disposition, or the holding separate, of any assets, categories
of assets or lines of business, of Buyer or its Affiliates (including the
business and assets of the Constituent Companies). The Parties expressly
acknowledge and agree that the entry by any Governmental Authority of an Order
permitting the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, but requiring
any of the assets or lines of business of Buyer or any of its respective
Affiliates to be held separately, sold or disposed of (including the business
and assets of the Constituent Companies), shall be deemed a failure to satisfy
the conditions specified in Section 7.1.

  

  

 

52  

  

(d) Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions necessary to satisfy (or be waived by the RWI Insurer)
by the Closing Date the RWI Conditions to Effectiveness other than conditions
that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing. Such actions
shall include, as promptly as reasonably practical, furnishing the RWI Insurer
(through the broker for the RWI Policy) with all such information as is
reasonably requested by the RWI Insurer in connection with the RWI Insurer's
issuance of a final and fully effective RWI Policy in conjunction with the
Closing. The Constituent Companies and the Equityholders shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to, provide all cooperation reasonably
requested by Buyer in connection with the arrangement and obtaining of the RWI
Policy. Such cooperation shall include provision to the Buyer of two complete
copies of the electronic data room in a format and on media acceptable to the
RWI Insurer so that Buyer can satisfy the RWI Conditions to Effectiveness
related to the electronic data room and retain a copy of what was provided to
the RWI Insurer. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of either
(a) the Closing or (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
terms hereof, Buyer shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status
of its efforts to arrange for and obtain issuance of the RWI Policy and
provide to the Company copies of all executed definitive documents related to
the RWI Policy. From and after the Closing, Equityholders and Equityholders'
Representative shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer to the extent necessary
in connection with any claim made by Buyer under the RWI Policy. All RWI Costs
will be paid one half by Buyer and one half by the Equityholders as provided
in Section 2.3(b)(vi). If at any time it becomes reasonably likely that for
any reason (other than as a result of failure of the Constituent Companies,
Largus, or the Equityholders to perform their respective obligations
hereunder) the RWI Conditions to Effectiveness would not be satisfied (or be
waived by the RWI Insurer) by the Closing Date, Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event or circumstance, a replacement
representations and warranties insurance policy, including from alternate
insurers (the " _Alternative RWI Policy_ "), on terms and conditions that are
substantially similar to those contained in the RWI Policy; provided, however,
that such Alternative RWI Policy shall not be subject to any additional or
modified conditions or other contingencies relating to the Constituent
Companies, Largus or the Equityholders without the prior written consent of
the Equityholders' Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Buyer shall deliver to the Constituent Companies, Largus
and the Equityholders' Representative complete and correct copies of all
amendments, supplements, other modifications, documents, binders or agreements
pursuant to which any Alternative RWI Policy shall be issued to Buyer. (For
purposes of this Agreement, as applicable, the term "RWI Policy" shall also be
deemed to include any Alternative RWI Policy, the term "RWI Conditions to
Effectiveness" shall also be deemed to include the corresponding conditions to
the liability of the insurer under such Alternative RWI Policy and the term
"RWI Costs" shall also be deemed to include the corresponding premiums, costs
and expenses for such Alternative RWI Policy).

  


 

  

6.4. _Employee Matters_.

  


 

  

(a) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date,
each individual (excluding Covered Employees and Specified Employees) who was
an employee of the Constituent Companies immediately prior to, and who
continues to be employed by the Constituent Companies after the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Constituent Company Employees_ ") shall be entitled to
receive: (i) an annual base salary or wage level, as applicable, that is
substantially similar to or no less favorable than that provided to similarly
situated employees of Buyer, (ii) bonus opportunities and other long term
cash-based incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer,
and (iii) employee benefits (including severance benefit, but excluding
equity-based compensation and defined benefits (whether pursuant to a
qualified or non-qualified retirement plan), retiree medical benefits, and
other retiree health and welfare arrangements) that are, in the aggregate,
substantially similar to or no less favorable than those provided to similarly
situated employees of Buyer. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee
of employment for any Constituent Company Employee, or to restrict the right
of Buyer to terminate the employment of any such Constituent Company Employee
following the Closing Date.

  

  

 

53  

  

(b) For purposes of participation of a Constituent Company Employee in a
benefit plan of Buyer or its Affiliates (a " _Buyer Benefit Plan_ ") on or
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to
credit each Constituent Company Employee with all years of service for which
such Constituent Company Employee was credited before the Closing Date under
any comparable Plans for the purposes of eligibility to participate and
service-based vesting; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such credit shall be
provided for purpose of determining the amount or level of benefits or for
purposes of vesting under any equity compensation plan of Buyer following the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall any credit be
given to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits for
the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any limitation on health and
welfare coverage of any Constituent Company Employee and his or her eligible
dependents due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting periods, active
employment requirements, and requirements to show evidence of good health
under the applicable health and welfare plan of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
to the extent such Constituent Company Employee and his or her eligible
dependents are covered under an analogous Plan, and such conditions, periods
or requirements are satisfied or waived under such Plan, immediately prior to
the Closing and (ii) credit each Constituent Company Employee and his or her
eligible dependents with all deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance
paid by such employee and covered dependents under the applicable Plan prior
to the Closing during the year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of
determining the extent to which any such employee and his or her dependents
have satisfied their deductible and whether they have reached the out-of-
pocket maximum requirements under any Buyer Benefit Plan for the applicable
year.

  


 

  

(c) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, credit each of the
Constituent Company Employees with an amount of paid vacation and sick leave
days following the Closing Date equal to the amount of vacation time and sick
leave days each such Constituent Company Employee has accrued or earned but
not yet used or otherwise received value in respect of as of the Closing Date
under the applicable Constituent Company vacation and sick leave policies as
in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, and allow each such
Constituent Company Employees to use such accrued vacation and sick leave days
at such times as each would have been permitted pursuant to the aforementioned
policies.

  


 

  

(d) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, honor, in accordance with
its terms, each Plan (which shall include any Severance Agreement entered into
in accordance with Section 6.1(a)(viii) of the Constituent Company Disclosure
Schedule) and all obligations thereunder including any rights or benefits
arising as a result of the Contemplated Transactions (either alone or in
combination with any other event, including termination of employment), and
Buyer hereby agrees and acknowledges that the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions constitutes a "change of control" or a "change in control" or
similar term, as the case may be, for all purposes under each Plan, as
applicable.

  


 

  

(e) Buyer and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for any notices
required to be given under, and to otherwise comply with, WARN or similar Laws
or regulations of any jurisdiction relating to any plant closing or mass
layoff (or similar triggering event) resulting from the Constituent Companies'
or Buyer's actions with respect to the layoff or termination of employment of
any Constituent Company Employees after the Closing Date.

  

  

 

54  

  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be obligated to continue to
employ any Constituent Company Employee for any specific period of time
following the Closing Date, subject to applicable Law. Nothing in this Section
6.4 shall (i) be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any
employee benefit plan (including any Plan) or (ii) prohibit Buyer or any of
its Affiliates from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan
(including any Plan) following the Closing Date.

  


 

  

6.5. _Indemnification of Directors, Managers and Officers_.

  


 

  

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Constituent
Companies and Largus to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of
the Constituent Companies and Largus to their current and former directors,
managers and officers (and those of their Subsidiaries) pursuant to any
indemnification provisions under (i) the certificate of incorporation, bylaws
and other similar organizational documents of the Constituent Companies or
Largus, as applicable, as in effect on the date of this Agreement and (ii)

Largus and any such Persons as in effect on the date of this Agreement and

other current and former directors, managers and officers of the Constituent
Companies and Largus, being referred to collectively as the " _D andO
Indemnified Parties_"). Subject to Section 6.5(d), from and after the Closing
Date through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall
cause the Constituent Companies and Largus to maintain the provisions with
respect to indemnification and exculpation from liability as set forth in the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational
documents of the Constituent Companies or Largus, as applicable, as of the
date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified during such period in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Party.

  


 

  

(b) Buyer and the Constituent Companies and Largus, jointly and severally
agree to pay from time to time as warranted all expenses, including attorneys'
fees, that may be incurred by the DandO Indemnified Parties in enforcing the

respective Subsidiaries, Largus or the transferee of such properties and
assets shall expressly assume and be responsible for all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this Section 6.5.

  


 

  

(d) This Section 6.5 shall survive the Closing Date, is intended to benefit
and may be enforced by the Constituent Companies, Largus and the DandO
Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of

(a) _Income Tax Treatment of the Purchase of the Partnership Constituent
Companies_. In accordance with Situation 2 of Rev. Rul. 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432,
the Parties intend the purchase and sale of the Constituent Company LLC
Interests of each of the Partnership Constituent Companies (other than Alamo
Barge Lines LLC and 16530 Peninsula Blvd. LLC) contemplated in this Agreement
to be treated, and agree to treat the purchase and sale of the Constituent
Company LLC Interests of each of the Partnership Constituent Companies (other
than Alamo Barge Lines LLC and 16530 Peninsula Blvd. LLC) contemplated in this
Agreement, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and for all applicable
foreign, state and local income Tax purposes to the extent permitted
thereunder) in the following manner: (i) with respect to the Equityholders of
each of the Partnership Constituent Companies (other than Alamo Barge Lines
LLC and 16530 Peninsula Blvd. LLC), as if such Equityholders sold their
respective partnership interests in such Partnership Constituent Company to
Buyer, and (ii) with respect to Buyer, as if such Partnership Constituent
Company distributed all of its assets (subject to the such Partnership
Constituent Company's liabilities) to such Equityholders in liquidation of
their respective partnership interests in such Partnership Constituent
Company, immediately followed by the purchase by Buyer from each of such
Equityholders of the undivided interests in the assets of such Partnership
Constituent Company deemed distributed to each of such Equityholders (subject
to such Equityholder's share of the such Partnership Constituent Company's
liabilities). After the Closing, as a result of the purchase and sale of the
Constituent Company LLC Interests of each of the Partnership Constituent
Companies (other than Alamo Barge Lines LLC and 16530 Peninsula Blvd. LLC)
contemplated in this Agreement, each of the Partnership Constituent Companies
(other than Alamo Barge Lines LLC and 16530 Peninsula Blvd. LLC) will be
disregarded as an entity separate from Buyer for U.S. federal and applicable
foreign, state and local income Tax purposes within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 301.7701-2(c)(2), and the Parties agree to prepare and file
all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the foregoing and further agree to
not take any position inconsistent therewith.

  

  

 

58  

  

(b) [ _Intentionally Left Blank_ ].

  


 

  

(c) _Allocation of the Purchase Price_.

  

  

(i) Within sixty (60) days following the date on which the Final Purchase
Price Adjustment Statement is finally determined, Buyer shall prepare and
provide to the Equityholders' Representative a statement (each, an "
_Allocation Statement_ ") with respect to each of the Partnership Constituent
Companies, allocating the portion of the Aggregate Cash Consideration
allocated to the Equity Securities of such Partnership Constituent Company
(including pursuant to Schedule 2.5(a)) and the assumed liabilities (together
with other relevant amounts) of such Partnership Constituent Company (taking
into account any adjustments thereof for Tax purposes pursuant to Section 2.4)
among the assets of such Partnership Constituent Company in accordance with
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (each such allocation, an "
_Allocation_ ").

  


 

  

(ii) Buyer and the Equityholders' Representative will act in good faith and
reasonably cooperate with each other to agree on the Allocation set forth on
each Allocation Statement in accordance with the requirements of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder. If Buyer and the Equityholders'
Representative cannot agree on any such Allocation within thirty (30) days of
the delivery of the Allocation Statement relating thereto to the
Equityholders' Representative, then any remaining disputed matters will be
submitted to an independent accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Buyer and
the Equityholders' Representative for resolution. Promptly, but not later than
fifteen (15) days after such matters are submitted to the independent
accounting firm for resolution, such independent accounting firm will
determine those matters in dispute and will render a written report as to the
disputed matters and the resulting Allocation Statement, which report and
resulting Allocation Statement shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties.
Any Allocation determined by such independent accounting firm shall
incorporate, reflect and be consistent with the requirements of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder. The fees and expenses of the independent
accounting firm in respect of such report shall be paid one-half by Buyer and
one-half by the Equityholders.

  


 

  

(iii) The Parties agree (A) to file, and to cause their respective Affiliates
to file, all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with each Allocation agreed to
by Buyer and the Equityholders' Representative or, if applicable, determined
pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures contained in Section 6.11(c)(ii)
and not to take (and to cause their respective Affiliates not to take) any
position inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return or any Tax Proceeding,
unless required to do so by applicable Law or with prior written consent of
the other Parties and (B) that each such Allocation shall be further revised,
as necessary and in a manner consistent with such Allocation, to reflect any
adjustment to the Aggregate Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 6.11(i) or
otherwise that is such reflected in the Allocation.

  


 

  

(d) _Straddle Periods and Apportionment_. Whenever it is necessary to
determine the liability for Taxes of any of the Acquired Companies for a
Straddle Period, the determination of such Taxes of such Acquired Company for
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on, and the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning the day after, the Closing Date shall be determined as
follows:

  

  

 

59  

  

(i) In the case of any Tax of any of the Acquired Companies that is based on
income, receipts, sales, revenue, production or similar items, or any other
Taxes not described in Section 6.11(d)(ii), the amount of such Tax
attributable to each of the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax
Period of such Straddle Period shall be determined based on an interim closing
of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and, for such
purposes, the taxable period of each of the Partnership Constituent Companies
will be deemed ended as the close of business on the Closing Date).

  


 

  

(ii) In the case of any real property, personal property and ad valorem Taxes
(" _Property Tax_ "), the amount of such Property Tax attributable to each of
the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle
Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Property Tax for the entire
Straddle Period, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the relevant portion of such Straddle Period, and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

  


 

  

(e) _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

  


 

  

(i) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.11(e)(ii), and with respect to
each Tax Return covering either a Straddle Period or a Pre-Closing Tax Period
that is required to be filed for, by, on behalf of or with respect to any of
the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare or cause to
be prepared, at Buyer's cost and expense, and in a manner consistent with past
practice, applicable Law and this Agreement (including Schedule 2.5(a)), each
such Tax Return and shall determine the portion of the Taxes shown as due on
such Tax Return that is (A) allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
amount thereof, if any, for which the Equityholders are responsible under this
Agreement (which amount, if any, shall be paid by the Equityholders to the
Buyer prior to the due date (including any extensions thereof) for filing such
Tax Return), and (B) allocable to a Post-Closing Tax Period, which
determination shall be set forth in a written statement (" _Statement_ ")
prepared by Buyer. Buyer shall deliver completed drafts of each such Tax
Return and the Statement related thereto (including related work papers) to
the Equityholders' Representative for his review and approval (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) at least thirty (30)
calendar days prior to the due date (including any extensions thereof) for
filing such Tax Return; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer shall not be required to make such delivery earlier than ten (10)
calendar days following the close of the applicable taxable period covered by
such Tax Return. Within five (5) calendar days of such delivery, the
Equityholders' Representative shall deliver to Buyer a written statement
describing any objections to such Tax Return or the Statement. If Buyer and
the Equityholders' Representative are unable to resolve any such objection
within the five (5) calendar day period after the delivery of such objections,
such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Buyer, as adjusted to the extent
necessary to reflect the resolution of any such objections mutually agreed to
by Buyer and the Equityholders' Representative. Any remaining objections with
respect to such Tax Return or the Statement shall be submitted to an
independent accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the Parties for resolution
and such independent accounting firm will determine those matters in dispute
and will render a written report as to the disputed matters, which report
shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties. The fees and expenses of the
independent accounting firm in respect of such report shall be paid one-half
by Buyer and one-half by the Equityholders. If necessary to reflect such
resolution, Buyer and the Equityholders' Representative shall cause such Tax
Return to be amended and filed with the appropriate Taxing Authority. With
respect to each Tax Return described in this Section 6.11(e)(i) and in Section
6.11(e)(ii), Buyer and each Equityholder, as applicable, will join in the
execution and filing of such Tax Return and other documentation as required by
applicable Law.

  

  

 

60  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including the foregoing
provisions of Section 6.11(e)(i), after the Closing, the Equityholders'
Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared, at the Equityholders'
cost and expense, and in a manner consistent with past practice, applicable
Law and this Agreement (including Schedule 2.5(a)), all Tax Returns for income
and franchise Taxes with respect to Largus and any of the Acquired Companies
for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date that are due
after the Closing Date (including for those jurisdictions and Taxing
Authorities that permit or require a short period Tax Return for income or
franchise Taxes for the period ending on and including the Closing Date, and
including such Tax Returns that reflect income, gain, loss, deduction, credit
or any similar item to be reported on a Tax Return of any Equityholder for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date) (all such Tax Returns
described in (A) or (B), " _Pre-Closing Equityholder Tax Returns_ "). The
Equityholders' Representative shall provide Buyer with copies of completed
drafts of each such Pre-Closing Equityholder Tax Return at least twenty-five
(25) days prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing thereof,
along with supporting workpapers, for Buyer's review and comment. Within
fifteen (15) days of such delivery, Buyer shall deliver to the Equityholders'
Representative a written statement describing any objections to such Pre-
Closing Equityholder Tax Return. If the Equityholders' Representative and
Buyer are unable to resolve any such objection within the five (5) day period
after the delivery of such objections, such Tax Return shall be filed as
prepared by the Equityholders' Representative, as adjusted to the extent
necessary to reflect the resolution of any such objections mutually agreed to
by the Equityholders' Representative and Buyer and, if applicable, to conform
such Tax Return in all respects with the applicable Allocation that has become
final and binding pursuant to Section 6.11(c). Any remaining objections with
respect to any such Pre-Closing Equityholder Tax Return that is a Higman
Marine, Inc. Combined Group Tax Return or a Largus Tax Return shall be
submitted to an independent accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the
Parties for resolution and such independent accounting firm will determine
those matters in dispute and will render a written report as to the disputed
matters, which report shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties. The fees
and expenses of the independent accounting firm in respect of such report
shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by the Equityholders. If
necessary to reflect such resolution, Buyer and the Equityholders'
Representative shall cause any such Higman Marine, Inc. Combined Group Tax
Return or Largus Tax Return to be amended and filed with the appropriate
Taxing Authority.

  


 

  

(iii) After the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not, with respect to
any Acquired Company, (A) file, or cause to be filed, any restatement or
amendment of, modification to or claim for refund relating to any Tax Return

controlled by Buyer pursuant to Section 6.11(k), make or initiate any
voluntary contact with any Taxing Authority with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, (C) extend or waive, or cause to be extended or waived, any
statute of limitations or other period for the assessment of any Tax or
deficiency with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, other than pursuant to
a Tax Proceeding controlled by Buyer pursuant to Section 6.11(k), or (D)
otherwise take any action with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, other than
pursuant to a Tax Proceeding controlled by Buyer pursuant to Section 6.11(k),
that is reasonably likely to result in any Equityholder or any Acquired
Company being liable for any Taxes, in each case, without the prior written
consent of the Equityholders' Representative, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

 

61  

  

(f) _Assistance and Cooperation_. From and after the Closing Date, each of the
Parties shall:

  


 

  

(i) assist (and cause their respective Affiliates to assist), to the extent
reasonably requested by another Party, in preparing any Tax Returns which such
other Party is responsible for preparing and filing;

  


 

  

(ii) cooperate as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party in
preparing for any Tax Proceeding regarding Taxes of any of the Acquired
Companies or Largus;

  


 

  

(iii) make available to the other Parties and to any Taxing Authority, as
reasonably requested, all relevant information, records, and documents
relating to Taxes or Tax Returns of any of the Acquired Companies (including
information necessary to file Tax Return extensions and make estimated Tax
payments); and

  


 

  

(iv) furnish the another Party, upon such other Party's reasonable request,
with copies of all correspondence received from any Taxing Authority in
connection with any Tax Proceeding with respect to any Taxes imposed on any of
the Acquired Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  


 

  

(g) _Transfer Taxes_. The Parties do not anticipate that any transfer, sales,
use, value added, excise, filing, recording, documentary, stamp or other
similar Taxes will arise as a result of the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
Transfer Taxes arise as a result of the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions, the payment of any and all such Transfer Taxes shall be borne
equally by the Equityholders, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand.
The Parties agree to cooperate fully with each other to minimize any such
liability for Transfer Taxes to the extent legally permissible, and the
Parties shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax
Returns regarding any Transfer Taxes that become payable in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions.

  


 

  

(h) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. The Equityholders shall cause any
and all Tax sharing or allocation agreements, intercompany agreements or other
agreements or arrangements among any of the Acquired Companies and any other
Person(s) relating to any Tax matters to be terminated with respect to each of
the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date, and from and after the Closing
Date, the Acquired Companies shall not be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder for any taxable period (whether past, current or future taxable
periods).

  


 

  

(i) _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties agree to treat any
indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the
Aggregate Cash Consideration for federal, state, local and foreign income Tax
purposes.

  

  

 

62  

  

(j) _Withholding_.

  


 

  

(i) Buyer may deduct and withhold from any consideration deliverable pursuant
to this Agreement to any Equityholder such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or any provision
of any Tax-related Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld
and timely remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. Buyer shall remit
any such amounts to the applicable Taxing Authority in accordance with
applicable Law.

  


 

  

(ii) No later than ten (10) days prior to delivering any consideration
described in this Section 6.11(j), Buyer shall notify the Equityholders'
Representative in writing if Buyer determines that any deduction or
withholding is required under the Code or any Tax-related Law. Such written
notice shall describe the basis for such deduction or withholding, and during
such ten (10) day period Buyer shall provide the Equityholders' Representative
with the opportunity to provide such forms, certificates or other evidence
required or necessary to, and shall cooperate with the Equityholders'
Representative to, eliminate or reduce any such deduction or withholding.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any deduction or withholding with
respect to any consideration described in this Section 6.11(j) was not
required prior to, and is required as a result of, an assignment by Buyer of
any of its rights under this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.10, Buyer shall
make (or cause to be made) such deduction or withholding and remit (or cause
to be remitted) such deducted or withheld amounts to the relevant Taxing
Authority, and pay to the relevant Equityholder(s) such additional amounts as
necessary such that the relevant Equityholder(s) receives the same amount as
it would have received had no such assignment been made (including with
respect to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this sentence).

  


 

  

(k) _Audits_.

  


 

  

(i) After the Closing Date, the Equityholders' Representative and Buyer shall
each notify the other in writing within five (5) days of the commencement of
any income Tax Proceeding with respect to any of the Acquired Companies for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Matter_ "), provided that the
failure of Buyer to give such notice within such time period will not affect
the obligations of the Equityholders or the Equityholders' Representative
under this Agreement except to the extent that the Equityholders are
materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain factual information
describing any such Pre-Closing Tax Matter and shall include copies of any
notice or other document received from any Taxing Authority with respect to
such Pre-Closing Tax Matter.

  


 

  

(ii) The Equityholders' Representative shall, at the expense of the
Equityholders, have the sole responsibility for, and the sole right to control
the conduct of, any Pre-Closing Tax Matter relating to any of the Partnership
Constituent Companies or any of the S Corporation Constituent Companies,
including any disposition of any such Pre-Closing Tax Matter; provided,
however, that Buyer, at its own expense, will have the right to review in
advance and comment upon all material submissions made in the course of any
such Pre-Closing Tax Matters. With respect to all other Tax Proceedings, Buyer
shall have the sole responsibility for, and the sole right to control the
conduct of, such Tax Proceeding, but, if the resolution of such Tax Proceeding
is reasonably likely to affect the liabilities of any Equityholder (including
under this Agreement), then the Equityholders' Representative will have the
right to review in advance and comment upon all material submissions made in
the course of such Tax Proceeding, and the Equityholders' Representative's
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) will be
required for any settlement of such Tax Proceeding by Buyer.

  

  

 

63  

  

(l) _Texas State Margin Tax Refunds_. Upon receipt by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates of any Texas margin tax refund described in Section 4.19 of the
Constituent Company Disclosure Schedule, Buyer shall promptly pay over such
refund to the Equityholders' Representative, except to the extent such refund
is included as a current asset in Closing Date Net Working Capital.

  


 

  

(m) _Survival; Exclusivity_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, each Party's representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements, rights and obligations with respect to any Tax or Tax matter
covered by this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall not terminate
until sixty (60) days after the expiration of all statutes of limitations
(including any and all extensions thereof) applicable to such Tax (or the
assessment thereof) or Tax matter.

  


 

  

(n) _Conflict_. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this
Section 6.11 and any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this
Section 6.11 shall control.

  


 

  

6.12. _RWI Policy_.

  


 

  

Buyer shall cause that at all times during the term of the RWI Policy such
policy shall expressly provide that (a) the insurer has no subrogation rights,
and will not pursue any claim against any Equityholder, its successor and
assigns except for fraud; (b) the Equityholders shall be third party
beneficiaries of the insurer's promise to not pursue any claim against any
Equityholder and its successor and assigns except for fraud; and (c) following
the date of such RWI Policy, Buyer may not modify the limitations on
subrogation against any Equityholder and its successors and assigns in the RWI
Policy without such Equityholder's express written consent.

  


 

  

6.13. _Certain Agreements_.

  


 

  

(a) At or prior to the Closing, the Equityholders and the Constituent
Companies shall take all actions necessary to terminate the agreements set
forth on Section 6.13 of the Constituent Companies Disclosure Schedule and all
guarantees related thereto, so that such agreement and guarantee shall have no
force and effect following the Closing.

  


 

  

(b) At or prior to the Closing, the employees of the Constituent Companies set
forth on Section 6.13(b) of the Constituent Companies Disclosure Schedule (the
" _Specified Employees_ ") shall have either retired or been terminated by the
applicable Constituent Company and/or their applicable Subsidiaries.

to facts existing at a specific date, which shall be true and correct as of
such date) except where the failure of any such representations or warranties

on such date (except for those representations and warranties which refer to
facts existing at a specific date, which shall be true and correct as of such

representations and warranties which refer to facts existing at a specific

failure of any such representations or warranties to be so true and correct
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have an Equityholder Material
Adverse Effect. The representations and warranties of the Equityholders in

This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing as follows:

  


 

  

(a) By the mutual written consent of the Equityholders' Representative, on the

(b) By Buyer at any time prior to the Closing, if (i) the Constituent
Companies, Largus or the Equityholders are in breach of the representations,
warranties or covenants made by the Constituent Companies, Largus or the
Equityholders in this Agreement, (ii) such breach is not cured or capable of
being cured by the earlier of the day prior to the Termination Date and thirty
(30) days following written notice of such breach from Buyer (to the extent
such breach is curable) and (iii) such breach, if not cured, would render the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.3 incapable of being satisfied;

  

  

 

67  

  

(c) By the Equityholders' Representative at any time prior to the Closing, if
(i) Buyer is in breach of the representations, warranties or covenants made by
it in this Agreement, (ii) such breach is not cured or capable of being cured
by the earlier of the day prior to the Termination Date and thirty (30) days
following written notice of such breach from the Equityholders' Representative
(to the extent such breach is curable) and (iii) such breach, if not cured,
would render the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 incapable of
being satisfied;

  


 

  

(d) By the Equityholders' Representative, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the
other hand, if the Closing shall not have occurred by August 4, 2018 (the "
_Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Equityholders'
Representative shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(d) if the Constituent Companies, Largus or any Equityholder
has breached this Agreement and such breach has resulted in the failure of a
condition in Sections 7.1 or 7.3 to be satisfied and (ii) Buyer shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if Buyer
has breached this Agreement and such breach has resulted in the failure of a
condition in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 to be satisfied; or

  


 

  

(e) By the Equityholders' Representative, on the one hand or Buyer, on the
other hand, if (i) the Contemplated Transactions shall violate any Order that

In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1,

Agreement will terminate, except that the rights, obligations and remedies of
the Parties in this Section 8.2, Section 6.7, and Article IX hereof and in the
Confidentiality Agreement will survive; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall
relieve a defaulting or breaching Party from any liability or damages arising
out of its willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement. In
no event shall the Constituent Companies, Largus or any Equityholder have any
liability to any Equityholder as a result of any termination of this
Agreement, regardless of the reason for such termination.

  

  

 

68  

  

 

ARTICLE IX

  

 _Indemnification_

  


 

  

9.1. _Survival_.

 

  

  

The representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement
(including the Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto and the certificates
delivered pursuant hereto) will survive the Closing until 5:00 p.m. (Central
time) on the day that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date,
provided, however, that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.3, Section 3.4 (clause (a)), Section 3.6,
Section 4.1, Section 4.2, the first sentence of Section 4.3, Section 4.4
(clause (a)), Section 4.7(b), Section 4.14(c), Section 4.21, Section 4.24(a),
Section 4.24(b), Section 4.24(c), Section 4.24(d), Section 4.24(e) (clause
(i)) and Section 4.24(i) (collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ ")
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement indefinitely, (ii)
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.19 (Taxes) and
Section 4.24(h) (Tax Matters) (the " _Tax Representations_ ") and in Section
4.13 and Section 4.18 shall expire sixty (60) days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, including all extensions and waivers
thereof. Any representation or warranty the violation of which is made the
basis of a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 will survive with
respect to such claim until such claim is finally resolved if Buyer notifies
the Equityholders' Representative of such claim in reasonable detail prior to
the date on which such representation or warranty would otherwise expire
hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, no claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.2 based on the breach or alleged breach of a
representation or warranty may be asserted after the time at which such
representation or warranty expires hereunder. The covenants and agreements of
Buyer and of the Constituent Companies, Largus and the Equityholders made in
or pursuant to this Agreement to be performed after the Closing will survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions in accordance with their terms.

  


 

  

9.2. _Indemnification of Buyer_

  


 

  

. Notwithstanding any investigation by Buyer or its representatives, the
Equityholders, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold Buyer, the
Constituent Companies, Largus and their respective Affiliates, managers,
directors, officers, employees and agents (each a " _Buyer Party_ ", and
collectively, the " _Buyer Parties_ ") harmless from any and all Liabilities,
obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, costs and expenses, including all
court costs, costs of investigation, litigation expenses and reasonable
attorneys' fees (collectively, " _Losses_ "), that any Buyer Party actually
suffers or incurs as a result of or relating to:

  


 

  

(a) the breach of any representation or warranty made by an Equityholder,
Largus or any Constituent Company in this Agreement;

  


 

  

(b) the breach of any covenant or agreement made by an Equityholder, Largus or
any Constituent Company in this Agreement;

  


 

  

(c) Seller Taxes; or

  


 

  

(d) Largus Taxes;

  


 

  

provided, however, that (1) recovery from the Indemnity Escrow Account shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Parties, the Constituent
Companies or their respective Affiliates with respect to any claims arising
out of or relating to any Losses under Section 9.2(a), and no Equityholder nor
its successors and assigns shall have any liability or obligation to any Buyer
Party, Constituent Company or any of their respective Affiliates with respect
to any such Losses other than by payments from the Indemnity Escrow Account,
(2) the Buyer Parties will not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.2(a) unless the aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Buyer
Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to such Section exceeds
$1,170,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case the Buyer Parties will be
entitled to indemnification for all such Losses in excess of the Deductible,
and (3) the maximum amount for which the Equityholders will be liable to the
Buyer Parties under Section 9.2(a) shall be $3,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ");
provided, further, that the Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to claims
for Losses in respect of breaches (or third party allegations of breach) by an
Equityholder or a Constituent Company of the Tax Representations except that,
with respect to such Losses, no Buyer Party shall be permitted to seek
recovery from any Equityholder unless and until the funds in the Indemnity
Escrow Account have been exhausted; provided, further, that in no event will
any Buyer Party be entitled to recover or make a claim for any amounts in
respect of, and in no event will such "Losses" be deemed to include, any Taxes
that are due to the unavailability in any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date of any net operating loss, credit or other
Tax attribute that arose in a Pre-Closing Tax Period other than as a result of
a breach of the representation made in Section 4.19(n).

  

  

 

69  

  

9.3. _Indemnification of Equityholders_

  


 

  

. Buyer will indemnify and hold the Equityholders, their respective Affiliates
and their respective managers, directors, officers, employees and agents
(collectively, the " _Equityholder Parties_ ") harmless from any and all
Losses that any Equityholder Party actually suffers or incurs as a result of
or relating to:

  


 

  

(a) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this
Agreement;

  


 

  

(b) the breach of any covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement;
or

  


 

  

(c) Buyer Taxes;

  


 

  

provided, however, that (1) the Equityholder Parties will not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.3(a) unless the aggregate amount of all
Losses for which the Equityholder Parties are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to such Section exceeds $1,170,000 (the " _Equityholders Deductible_
"), in which case the Equityholder Parties will be entitled to indemnification
for all such Losses, and (2) the maximum amount for which Buyer will be liable
to the Equityholder Parties under Section 9.3(a) shall be $3,000,000 (the "
_Equityholders Cap_ ").

  


 

  

9.4. _Calculation of Losses._

  


 

  

(a) For purposes of determining the amount of any Losses subject to
indemnification under this Article IX, and for purposes of determining whether
a breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement has occurred, no
effect shall be given to any qualifications or limitations regarding
materiality, Equityholder Material Adverse Effect or Constituent Company
Material Adverse Effect or words of similar effect.

  


 

  

(b) In calculating any amount hereunder in respect of Losses, Losses shall be
reduced by any amounts actually recovered by the applicable Buyer Parties or
Equityholder Parties (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") under applicable insurance
policies, under any indemnification or similar agreements, or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses (other than an Affiliate of
such Indemnified Party), or other rights of recovery with respect to such
Losses, net of any deductible or any other reasonable and necessary out-of-
pocket expense incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such recovery.
If an Indemnified Party or its Affiliates receives any such recovery after an
indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Parties (defined herein) has been
made, then such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates shall promptly reimburse
the Indemnifying Parties for any payment made, but not in excess of the amount
received by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates.

  

  

 

70  

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
any Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article
IX, or to make a claim for breach of any other provision of this Agreement or
to any other remedy at Law or in equity, to the extent any Losses were
attributable to such Indemnified Party's own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Indemnified Party shall take commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate any Loss upon and after becoming aware of any facts, matters,
failures or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in any
Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder; provided that neither Buyer nor any
of the Constituent Companies shall be required to pursue any claims against
any customer or employee of Buyer of any Constituent Companies. In the event
the Indemnified Party shall fail to take, or cause to be taken, commercially
reasonable steps (subject to the proviso in the immediately preceding
sentence), then notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Indemnifying Parties shall not be required to indemnify the Indemnified
Party for that portion of the Loss that could reasonably have been avoided if
the Indemnified Party had taken such commercially reasonable steps.

  


 

  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to Losses resulting from covenant
breaches by Equityholders, no Equityholder shall be liable for covenant
breaches by any other Equityholder.

  


 

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall an Indemnifying Party be liable for any special, punitive or exemplary
damages, in each case of any kind or nature (in each case other than to the
extent such damages are payable pursuant to a Third Party Claim).

  


 

  

(f) With respect to any Losses incurred by the Buyer Parties under this
Agreement, each Equityholder's maximum liability shall be capped by 100% of
the amount of pre-Tax cash actually paid to such Equityholder in respect of
such Equityholder's Equity Securities under this Agreement.

  


 

  

(g) No Indemnified Party shall have any right to indemnification or recovery
for Losses under Section 9.2 or Section 9.3 to the extent such Losses would
duplicate any amount or item included in the calculation or determination of
the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement.

  


 

  

9.5. _Notice._

  


 

  

(a) Any Indemnified Party entitled to receive indemnification under this
Article IX agrees to give prompt written notice to the party or parties
required to provide such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") upon
the occurrence of any indemnifiable Loss or the assertion of any claim or the
commencement of any action or proceeding in respect of a Loss (each, a "
_Claim_ "), but the Indemnified Party's failure to give such notice will not
affect the obligations of the Indemnifying Party under this Article IX except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby.
Such written notice will include a reference to the event or events forming
the basis of such Loss or Claim and the amount involved, unless such amount is
uncertain or contingent, in which event the Indemnified Party will give a
later written notice when the amount becomes fixed.

  

  

 

71  

  

(b) Unless the matter comprising a Claim for which any of the Buyer Parties is
the Indemnified Party is entirely RWI Excluded Matter, the Buyer shall notify
the RWI Insurer and the Buyer shall initiate the claims process as and when
provided in the RWI Policy, and the Buyer's notice under Section 9.5(a), or an
update thereto, shall so advise the Indemnifying Party. Any Claim for which,
in whole or in part, a claim is being pursued under the RWI Policy shall be
deemed a "RWI Parallel Claim," until such time it has been determined by
adjudication or agreement between the Buyer and RWI Insurer, including a
determination that it is RWI Excluded Matter. During such time as an RWI
Parallel Claim exists, if the amount of Losses in controversy under such Claim
exceed the amount then held in the Indemnity Escrow Account (such excess
amount, the " _RWI Parallel Claim Excess Amount_ "), and such RWI Parallel
Claim Excess Amount is greater than the amount then held in the Indemnity
Escrow Account, then the Claim shall be stayed for purposes of this Article
IX, except for that portion of an RWI Parallel Claim falling within the
retention under the RWI Policy to which Sections 9.2 and 9.7 shall apply
notwithstanding the stay hereunder, such that the Indemnifying Party shall pay
its share of amount within the retention notwithstanding the pendency of a
claim under the RWI Policy for the RWI Parallel Claim. In addition, to the
extent that any portion of a Claim under this Article IX constitutes RWI
Excluded Matter, the stay hereunder shall be lifted if and to the extent that
the exercise of indemnification rights and procedures under this Article IX
will not materially prejudice pursuit of a recovery under the RWI Policy for
the RWI Parallel Claim.

  


 

  

9.6. _Defense of Claims_.

  


 

  

(a) In the case of third-party claims (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnifying Party may elect to assume and control the defense of any such
Claim, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party and the payment of expenses related thereto, if: (i) the
Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and
diligently; (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with
evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying
Party will have adequate financial resources to defend against the claim and
fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder; (iii) the claim involves
only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party; (iv) the Indemnified Party has not been advised
by counsel that an actual or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of the claim;
(v) the claim does not relate to or otherwise arise in connection with any
criminal or regulatory enforcement matter or investigations or official
inquiries regarding the same, and (vi) prior to assuming the defense of any
such Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party must first have agreed in
writing to the satisfaction of the Indemnified Party that the Third-Party
Claim is subject to indemnification under this Article IX. Failure of the
Indemnifying Party to notify the Indemnified Party of its election to defend
any such claim or action by a third party within thirty (30) days after notice
thereof shall have been given by the Indemnified Party, shall be deemed a
waiver of any such election.

  

  

 

72  

  

(b) If the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third Party
Claim in accordance with Section 9.6(a), (i) the Indemnified Party may retain
separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the
defense of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnified Party will not consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third Party Claim, nor take any voluntary action prejudicial to the
determination of the Third Party Claim, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party and (iii) the Indemnifying Party will not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third Party Claim unless written agreement is obtained releasing the
Indemnified Party subject to the Third Party Claim from all liability
thereunder. If the Indemnifying Party is not conducting the defense of the
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim or
litigation in such manner as it deems appropriate, but the Indemnified Party
will not consent to the entry of any settlement or enter into any settlement
with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  


 

  

9.7. _Indemnity Escrow_

  


 

  

. Buyer shall be entitled to all or a portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount
to the extent of any obligations of the Equityholders, Largus or the
Constituent Companies under this Article IX. To the extent funds are due to
Buyer, Buyer and the Equityholders' Representative shall deliver a Joint
Direction to the Escrow Agent to release such funds to Buyer. In the event
there is a dispute regarding the amount of funds to be released from the
Adjustment Escrow Account or the Indemnity Escrow Account, only that portion
of the funds in dispute shall be held back and not released until resolution
of the dispute. If any funds remain in the Indemnity Escrow Account eighteen
(18) months after the Closing Date, Buyer and the Equityholders'
Representative shall deliver a Joint Direction to the Escrow Agent to release
all remaining funds as instructed by the Equityholders' Representative, other
than amounts in dispute under any indemnity Claim of Buyer then still
unresolved (which amounts in dispute shall be released as instructed by the
Equityholders' Representative once all such Claims are resolved).

  


 

  

9.8. _Exclusive Remedy_

  


 

  

. If the Closing shall occur, from and after the Closing, in the absence of
fraud, the remedies provided in this Article IX shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies of the Buyer Parties with respect to this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transaction except as expressly provided in this Agreement;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent or prohibit any party
hereto from seeking specific performance, injunctive relief or any other
equitable remedy.

  

  

 

ARTICLE X

  

Miscellaneous

  


 

  

10.1. _Equityholders ' Representative_.

 

  

  

 

(a) Each of the Equityholders hereby constitutes and irrevocably appoints,
effective from and after the date hereof, John T. McMahan as such
Equityholder's agent and attorney-in-fact (in such capacity, the "
_Equityholders ' Representative_"), with full power of substitution to act as
Equityholders' Representative on behalf of the Equityholders to the extent and
in the manner set forth in this Agreement. In the event of the resignation of
the Equityholders' Representative, a successor Equityholders' Representative
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer shall thereafter be appointed by an
instrument in writing signed by Buyer, each of the Equityholders and such
successor Equityholders' Representative.

  

 

  

 

73  

  

(b) The Equityholders' Representative is hereby authorized and empowered to
act for, and on behalf of, any or all of the Equityholders (with full power of
substitution in the premises) in connection with (i) the purchase price
adjustment set forth in Section 2.4, (ii) the termination of this Agreement as
set forth in Section 8.1 and (iii) such other matters as are reasonably
necessary for the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions including,
without limitation, (A) to direct or receive all payments owing to the
Equityholders under this Agreement, (B) to withhold any amounts received on
behalf of the Equityholders in order to satisfy any actual or potential
liabilities of the Equityholders under this Agreement, (C) to make any
payments on behalf of the Equityholders and collect from the Equityholders (in
accordance with each Equityholder's Applicable Portion) any amounts paid in
settlement of any claims under this Agreement, (D) authorize the delivery or
release to Buyer of funds held in the Adjustment Escrow Account and the
Indemnity Escrow Account, (E) to terminate, amend, waive any provision of, or
abandon, this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Documents, (F) to act as the
representative of the Equityholders to review and authorize all claims and
disputes or question the accuracy thereof, (G) to negotiate and compromise on
their behalf with Buyer any claims asserted hereunder and to authorize
payments to be made with respect thereto, (H) to distribute any payments to
Equityholders as contemplated by this Agreement, (I) to take such further
actions as are authorized in this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, and
(J) in general, do all things and perform all acts, including, without
limitation, executing and delivering all agreements (including the Ancillary
Documents), certificates, receipts, consents, elections, instructions and
other documents contemplated by or deemed by the Equityholders' Representative
to be necessary or desirable in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary
Documents and the Contemplated Transactions. Buyer shall be entitled to rely
on such appointment and to treat the Equityholders' Representative as the duly
appointed attorney-in-fact of each Equityholder. Notices given to the
Equityholders' Representative in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement shall constitute notice to the Equityholders for all purposes under
this Agreement. The Equityholders' Representative shall not have any duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, and no
implied covenants, agreements, functions, duties, responsibilities,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or shall
otherwise exist against the Equityholders' Representative.

  


 

  

(c) The appointment of the Equityholders' Representative is an agency coupled
with an interest and is irrevocable and any action taken by the Equityholders'
Representative pursuant to the authority set forth in this Section 10.1 shall
be effective and absolutely binding on each Equityholder notwithstanding any
contrary action of or direction from such Equityholder, except for actions or
omissions of the Equityholders' Representative constituting intentional fraud.
The death or incapacity, or dissolution or other termination of existence, of
any Equityholder shall not terminate the authority and agency of the
Equityholders' Representative. Buyer and any other Party to an Ancillary
Document in dealing with the Equityholders' Representative may conclusively
rely, without inquiry, upon any act of the Equityholders' Representative as
the act of the Equityholders.

  

  

 

74  

  

(d) Each Equityholder hereby releases the Equityholders' Representative from,
and each Equityholder agrees to indemnify the Equityholders' Representative
against, liability for any action taken or not taken by the Equityholders'
Representative in its capacity as such (including the expenses referred to in
Section 10.1(e) hereof), except for the liability of the Equityholders'
Representative to an Equityholder for loss which such Equityholder may suffer
from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Equityholders'
Representative in carrying out its duties hereunder or under the Ancillary
Documents. The Equityholders' Representative shall not be liable to any
Equityholder or to any other Person, with respect to any action taken or
omitted to be taken by the Equityholders' Representative in its role as
Equityholders' Representative under or in connection with this Agreement or
any Ancillary Document, unless such action or omission results from or arises
out of intentional fraud or willful misconduct on the part of the
Equityholders' Representative, and the Equityholders' Representative shall not
be liable to any Equityholder in the event that, in the exercise of its
reasonable judgment, the Equityholders' Representative believes there will not
be adequate resources available to cover potential costs and expenses to
contest a claim made by Buyer against the Equityholders. Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that the Equityholders' Representative is a Party to this Agreement
solely for purposes of serving as the "Equityholders' Representative" and that
no claim shall be brought by or on behalf of Buyer against the Equityholders'
Representative with respect to this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or the
Contemplated Transactions (it being understood that any covenant or agreement
that requires performance by the "Parties" or a "Party" at or prior to the
Closing shall not be deemed to require performance by the Equityholders'
Representative unless performance by the Equityholders' Representative is
expressly provided for in such covenant or agreement).

  


 

  

(e) The Equityholders' Representative shall receive no compensation for
service as such but shall receive reimbursement from, and be indemnified from,
the Equityholders' Representative Expense Amount, by the Equityholders, in
accordance with each Equityholder's Applicable Portion, for any and all
expenses, charges and liabilities, including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys' fees (collectively, the " _Equityholders ' Representative
Expenses_"), incurred by the Equityholders' Representative in the performance
or discharge of its duties set forth in this Section 10.1. If the amount of
the Equityholders' Representative Expense Amount is less than the
Equityholders' Representative Expenses, each Equityholder hereby agrees to
pay, and shall pay, to the Equityholders' Representative an amount equal to
the product of (i) such Equityholder's Applicable Portion, _times_ (ii) the
difference between (x) the Equityholders' Representative Expenses and (y) the
Equityholders' Representative Expense Amount.

  


 

  

10.2. _Expenses_.

  


 

  

Except as provided in Section 10.1, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by the Party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the Contemplated Transactions are
consummated.

  


 

  

10.3. _Notices_.

  


 

  

All notices and other communications given or made pursuant hereto shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made (a) as of the date
delivered, if delivered personally, (b) on the date the delivering Party
receives an affirmative confirmation during normal business hours (and if not,
the next Business Day) from the Party or the attorney for the Party to whom
notice was intended, if delivered by facsimile or e-mail, (c) three (3)
Business Days after being mailed by registered or certified mail (postage

10.4. _Governing Law_.

  


 

  

This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws (excluding conflict of laws rules and principles) of
the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed
entirely within such State, including all matters of construction, validity
and performance.

  


 

  

10.5. _Entire Agreement_.

  


 

  

This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the
Constituent Company Disclosure Schedule, the Ancillary Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement of the Parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior contracts or
agreements, whether oral or written.

  


 

  

10.6. _Severability_.

  


 

  

Should any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any
Person or circumstance be held invalid or unenforceable to any extent: (a)
such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, and only to the extent, of
such unenforceability or prohibition and shall be enforced to the greatest
extent permitted by Law, (b) such unenforceability or prohibition in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision as
applied (i) to other Persons or circumstances or (ii) in any other
jurisdiction, and (c) such unenforceability or prohibition shall not affect or
invalidate any other provision of this Agreement.

  


 

  

10.7. _Amendment_.

  


 

  

Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms hereof may be terminated, amended,
supplemented or modified orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed
by the Constituent Companies, Largus, the Equityholders' Representative and
Buyer; _provided_ , that the observance of any provision of this Agreement may
be waived in writing by the Party that will lose the benefit of such provision
as a result of such waiver.

  

  

 

77  

  

10.8. _Effect of Waiver or Consent_.

  


 

  

No waiver or consent, express or implied, by any Party to or of any breach or
default by any Party in the performance by such Party of its obligations
hereunder shall be deemed or construed to be a consent or waiver to or of any
other breach or default in the performance by such Party of the same or any
other obligations of such Party hereunder. No single or partial exercise of
any right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
any right or power, shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. Failure on the part of a Party to
complain of any act of any Party or to declare any Party in default,
irrespective of how long such failure continues, shall not constitute a waiver
by such Party of its rights hereunder until the applicable statute of
limitation period has run.

  


 

  

10.9. _Parties in Interest; Limitation on Rights of Others_.

  


 

  

The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit
of, the Parties hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors
and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied,
shall be construed to give any Person (other than the Parties hereto and their
respective legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns and as
expressly provided herein) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under
or in respect of this Agreement or any covenants, conditions or provisions
contained herein, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise; _provided_ , that
from and after the Closing, the DandO Indemnified Parties shall be third party
beneficiaries of the provisions of Section 6.5, with the right to pursue
claims for damages and other relief (including specific performance or other
equitable relief) in the event of any breach thereof.

  


 

  

10.10. _Assignability_.

  


 

  

This Agreement shall not be assigned by the Constituent Companies or Largus
without the prior written consent of Buyer and the Equityholders'
Representative. Prior to Closing, this Agreement shall not be assigned by
Buyer without the prior written consent of the Constituent Companies, Largus
and the Equityholders' Representative; except that Buyer may assign its rights
and obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate of Buyer but such
assignment shall not release Buyer from its obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

 

78  

  

10.11. _Company Disclosure Schedule_.

  

  

For the purposes of this Agreement, any matter that is disclosed in the
Constituent Company Disclosure Schedule in a manner that makes its relevance
to one or more other schedules reasonably apparent shall be deemed to have
been included in such other schedules notwithstanding the omission of a cross
reference thereto. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter
in the Constituent Company Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an
admission or indication that such item or other matter is material (nor shall
it establish a standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever) or that
such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the
Constituent Company Disclosure Schedule. The information set forth in the
Constituent Company Disclosure Schedule is disclosed solely for the purposes
of this Agreement, and no information set forth therein shall be deemed to be
an admission by any Party hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever,
including any violation of Law or breach of any Contract. The Company
Disclosure Schedule and the information and disclosures contained therein are
intended only to qualify and limit the representations, warranties and
covenants of the Equityholders and the Constituent Companies, contained in
this Agreement. Nothing in the Constituent Company Disclosure Schedule is
intended to broaden the scope of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement or create any covenant. Matters reflected in the Constituent
Company Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by
the Agreement to be reflected in the Constituent Company Disclosure Schedule.
Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.

  


 

  

10.12. _Jurisdiction; Court Proceedings; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  


 

  

Any Litigation against any Party to this Agreement arising out of or in any
way relating to this Agreement shall be brought in any federal or state court
located in New Castle County, in the State of Delaware, and each of the
Parties hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the
purpose of any such Litigation; _provided_ , that a final judgment in any such
Litigation shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. EACH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES NOT TO ASSERT (A) ANY OBJECTION WHICH
IT MAY EVER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION IN ANY FEDERAL
OR STATE COURT LOCATED NEW CASTLE COUNTY IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE, (B) ANY
CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH LITIGATION BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN
AN INCONVENIENT FORUM AND (C) ANY CLAIM THAT SUCH COURT DOES NOT HAVE
JURISDICTION WITH RESPECT TO SUCH LITIGATION. To the extent that service of
process by mail is permitted by applicable Law, each Party irrevocably
consents to the service of process in any such Litigation in such courts by
the mailing of such process by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid,
at its address for notices provided for herein. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ACTION ARISING
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREES THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS
PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND
BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION.

  


 

  

10.13. _No Other Duties_.

  


 

  

The only duties and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement are as
specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no other duties or obligations
shall be implied in fact, law or equity, or under any principle of fiduciary
obligation.

  


 

  

10.14. _Reliance on Counsel and Other Advisors_.

  


 

  

Each Party has consulted such legal, financial, technical or other expert as
it deems necessary or desirable before entering into this Agreement. Each
Party represents and warrants that it has read, knows, understands and agrees
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

  

 

79  

  

10.15. _Remedies_.

  


 

  

All remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded to
the Parties hereunder, shall be cumulative and not alternative, and any Person
having any rights under any provision of this Agreement will be entitled to
enforce such rights specifically, to recover damages by reason of any breach
of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights granted by Law, equity or
otherwise.

  


 

  

10.16. _Specific Performance_.

  


 

  

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties agree
that, in addition to any other remedies, each Party shall be entitled to
enforce the terms of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy.
Each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy. Each Party further agrees that the only
permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action for equitable
relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of
this Agreement.

  


 

  

10.17. _Counterparts_.

  


 

  

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts (including
counterparts transmitted via facsimile or in .pdf or similar format) with the
same effect as if all signatory Parties had signed the same document. All
counterparts shall be construed together and shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

  


 

  

10.18. _Further Assurance_.

  


 

  

If at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary or desirable
to fully effect the Contemplated Transactions, each of the Parties shall take
such further action (including the execution and delivery of such further
instruments and documents) as any other Party reasonably may request.

  

  

 

80  

  

10.19. _Legal Representation_.

  

  

It is acknowledged by the Parties that the Constituent Companies, the
Equityholders (other than the Largus Seller) and the Equityholders'
Representative have retained Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP ("
_Fried Frank_ ") to act as its counsel in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions and that Fried Frank has not acted as counsel for any other Party
hereto in connection with the Contemplated Transactions and that none of the
other Parties hereto has the status of a client of Fried Frank for conflict of
interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. Buyer, the Constituent
Companies, Largus, the Equityholders and the Equityholders' Representative
hereby agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between Buyer, Largus, the Constituent Companies and/or the Constituent
Companies' Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Equityholders (other than
the Largus Seller) and/or the Equityholders' Representative, on the other
hand, Fried Frank may represent the Equityholders (other than the Largus
Seller) and the Equityholders' Representative in such dispute even though the
interests of the Equityholders and Equityholders' Representative may be
directly adverse to Buyer or the Constituent Companies and/or their
Subsidiaries or Largus, and even though Fried Frank may have represented the
Constituent Companies or their Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related
to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Buyer, the Constituent
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries. Buyer further agrees that, as to all
communications among Fried Frank, the Constituent Companies, Largus, the
Equityholders and/or the Equityholders' Representative and/or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates that relate in any way to the
Contemplated Transactions, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation
of client confidence belongs to the Equityholders (other than the Largus
Seller) and the Equityholders' Representative and may be controlled by the
Equityholders (other than the Largus Seller) and the Equityholders'
Representative and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer, the Constituent
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries or other Affiliates or Largus or any of
