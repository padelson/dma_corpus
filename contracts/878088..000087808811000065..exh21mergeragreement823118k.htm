time and only to the extent it becomes earned and distributable, the
applicable Pro Rata Share of any portion of the Escrow Amount paid to the
Company Securityholders pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and in accordance
with Section 11.11. The payment of the Closing Option Consideration shall be
reduced by any applicable income or employment Tax withholding required under
the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such Vested Company
Options to the extent paid over to the applicable Tax Authority. For the
avoidance of doubt, all Company Options with an exercise price greater than
the Per Share Consideration will be cancelled and will not have any right to
receive any consideration in respect thereof.

(iii)

No outstanding Company SARs shall be assumed or substituted by Parent. Each
Company SAR shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of Parent, the Company or the Company SARholder, be irrevocably cancelled and
terminated and each then unexercised and outstanding Vested Company SAR shall
convert into the right to receive a cash payment, without interest, which
shall be equal to: (A) the Closing SAR Consideration, payable in accordance
with Section 3.5(c), _plus_ (B) at such time and only to the extent it becomes
earned and distributable, the applicable Pro Rata Share of any additional
amount paid pursuant to Section 3.6(d) _plus_ (C) at such time and only to the
extent it becomes earned and distributable, the applicable Pro Rata Share of
any portion of the Escrow Amount paid to the Company Securityholders pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement and in accordance with Section 11.11. The payment of
the Closing SAR Consideration shall be reduced by any applicable income or
employment Tax withholding required under the Code or any provision of
applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of such Vested Company SARs to the extent paid over to the
applicable Tax Authority. For the avoidance of doubt, all Company SARs with a
grant price greater than the Per Share Consideration will be cancelled and
will not have any right to receive any consideration in respect thereof.


 

(iv)

Prior to the Closing, and subject to the review and approval of Parent, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Section 3.1 under the Company Equity Plans, Company RSU
agreements, Company Option agreements, Company SAR agreements and all other
plans or arrangements of the Company (whether written or oral, formal or
informal), including delivering all required notices and obtaining any
required consents, such that, at the Closing, the Company shall not have any
outstanding equity interests or equity-related interests other than shares of
Company Common Stock, Company RSUs, Company Options and Company SARs.

(d)

_Dissenting Shares_. 

(i)

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a Dissenting Stockholder (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") who, as of the
Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost his appraisal rights
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Per Share
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c), any additional amount paid pursuant
to Section 3.6(d) or any portion of the Escrow Amount paid to the Company
Stockholders. Each holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such
rights as are granted by the Dissenters Rights Statute and, unless and until
such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their
appraisal rights under the DGCL, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist.

(ii)

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1(d)(i), if any Dissenting
Stockholder effectively withdraws or loses (through the failure to perfect or
otherwise) his, her or its rights to receive payment for the fair value of
his, her or its Dissenting Shares under the Dissenters Rights Statute, then,
as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such
Dissenting Shareholders Company Common Stock (A) shall no longer be deemed
Dissenting Shares and (B) shall be treated as if it had been converted
automatically into and represents only the right to receive the consideration
set forth in Section 3.1(c)(i).

(iii)

The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
or purchase pursuant to the Dissenters Rights Statute, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the Dissenters Rights
Statute and received by the Company, and shall provide promptly copies of any
written notice or correspondence from any putative dissenter and/or
dissenters counsel, and (B) the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal or purchase under the
Dissenters Rights Statute. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
offer to make, agree to make or make any payment with respect to any demands
for dissenters rights with respect to Company Common Stock or offer to settle
or compromise any such demands.

(iv)

All expenses incurred by the Company and Parent with respect to the exercise
of any dissenters rights in accordance with the Dissenters Rights Statute
through the Closing Date shall be treated as Company Transaction Expenses, and
all such expenses incurred by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary thereof after the Closing Date (excluding any amounts paid to
Dissenting Stockholders in satisfaction of such appraisal rights that are
equal to the consideration received by Company Stockholders in accordance with


 

Section 3.1(c)) shall be payable out of the Escrow Amount pursuant to written
instructions delivered by Parent to Escrow Agent. 

Section 3.2

_Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the aggregate amount (including any amounts withheld pursuant to
Section 3.5(g)) Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company
Securityholders in exchange for the acquisition by Parent of all shares of
Company Common Stock (including each Company RSA and each share of Company
Common Stock represented by a Vested Company RSU) and the cancellation of all
Vested Company Options and Vested Company SARs shall be equal to the aggregate
of the following amounts: (a) an amount in cash equal to $410,000,000 (the "
_Closing Payment_ ") _plus_ (b) all Closing Cash (collectively, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), as adjusted pursuant to Sections 3.3 and 3.6 and payable in
accordance with Sections 3.4 and 3.5. 

Section 3.3

_Pre-Closing Adjustment; Disbursement Schedule_. 

(a)

Prior to the Closing, the Company shall first use its available cash to repay
all applicable Company Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses and Benefits
Liabilities, if any.

(b)

Not later than three Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date
(after giving effect to the payments of all amounts required by Section
3.3(a)), the Company and Parent shall together prepare a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries estimated as of the Closing (the "
_Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ "), prepared in accordance with GAAP,
together with a schedule and worksheet (the " _Estimated Closing Payment
Calculation_ ") setting forth the Companys good faith estimate of the (i)
Closing Working Capital ascertained from the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
(the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ "); (ii) Closing Date Indebtedness
(the " _Estimated Company Indebtedness_ "); (iii) Company Transaction Expenses
(the " _Estimated Company Transaction Expenses_ "); (iv) Benefits Liabilities,
if any (" _Estimated Benefits Liabilities_ "); (v) Closing Cash (" _Estimated
Cash_ ") and (vi) Transaction Deductions (the " _Estimated Transaction
Deductions_ "). In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall provide
to Parent, within a reasonable period of time prior to the preparation of such
estimates, copies of, or access to, all books, records, receipts and other
information and documentation reasonably necessary for Parent to confirm the
Companys calculation of the Estimated Closing Working Capital, Estimated
Company Indebtedness, Estimated Company Transaction Expenses, Estimated
Benefits Liabilities, Estimated Cash and Estimated Transaction Deductions. If
the amount of the Estimated Closing Working Capital is less than the Target
Working Capital Amount, then such deficiency shall be deducted from the
Closing Payment, and if the Estimated Closing Working Capital is greater than
the Target Working Capital Amount, then such excess shall be added to the
Closing Payment. The Closing Payment, following the adjustments contemplated
by this Section 3.3(b), is referred to herein as the " _Estimated Closing
Payment_ ".

(c)

Together with the delivery of the Estimated Closing Payment Calculation, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a schedule (the " _Closing Payment
Disbursement Schedule_ ") setting forth:

(i)

each Company Securityholders ownership of Company Common Stock, Vested
Company Options or Vested Company SARs, as applicable, as of the Effective
Time;


 

(ii)

the portion of Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness set forth next to the name
of each Person receiving such portion of the Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness;

(iii)

the portion of the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses set forth next to
the name of each Person receiving such portion of the Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses;

(iv)

the portion of the Estimated Benefits Liabilities, if any, to be paid to each
recipient thereof (assuming no failure of any of the conditions to each such
recipients receipt of a Change of Control and Severance Payment prior to the
Closing);

(v)

the applicable portion of the Estimated Closing Payment, if any, to be paid to
each Company Securityholder; and

(vi)

detailed wire instructions for each Person listed on the Closing Payment
Disbursement Schedule.

Escrow Agreement, the " _Escrow Amount_ "), which may be used by the Parent
Indemnified Persons to satisfy (A) the payment of a post-Closing adjustment

Section 3.6, and (B) any indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying

transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the Closing Payment
Disbursement Schedule.

(c)

to the Closing, Parent shall pay, on behalf of the Company and as a deduction
from the Estimated Closing Payment, the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses

Closing, Parent shall pay to the Company, as a deduction from the Estimated

applicable amount, less any required withholding, to each applicable payee of
a Benefit Liability.

the Securityholders Representative, by wire transfer of immediately available

be deducted from the Estimated Closing Payment. 

(f)

_Payment to Company Securityholders_. After the payments contemplated by
Sections 3.4(a) through 3.4(e) are made, (i) Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Paying Agent, by one or more wire transfers of
immediately available funds, (A) the remainder of the Closing Payment and (B)
the Severance Payment Contribution, which shall be in addition to the Closing
Payment payable by Parent hereunder; and (ii) the Company shall deposit with
the Paying Agent, by one or more wire transfers of immediately available

Paying Agent in accordance with Section 3.5. 

Section 3.5

_Surrender of Company Common Stock, Cancellation of Company Options and
Company SARs and Payment to Stockholders_.

(a)

_Paying Agent_. At the Closing, Parent and the Securityholders
Representative shall engage a mutually agreeable paying agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent and the Securityholders Representative. The agreement with the
Paying Agent shall state that the Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying
Agent in (i) short-term obligations of the U.S. government, (ii) certificates
of deposit issued by a bank or trust company having combined capital and
surplus of at least $500,000,000, (iii) short-term money market instruments or
(iv) such other investments as directed by joint written notice of Parent and
the Securityholders Representative. Any interest or other income produced by
such investment shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation. All fees and
expenses payable to the Paying Agent through and including the Closing Date
shall be treated as Company Transaction Expenses, and all such fees and
expenses incurred by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
thereof after the Closing Date shall be payable out of the Escrow Amount
pursuant to written instructions delivered by Parent to Escrow Agent. 

(b)

_Exchange Procedure_. Not later than the tenth Business Day prior to the
anticipated Closing Date (as mutually and reasonably determined by Parent and
the Company), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Company
Stockholder (other than holders of solely Dissenting Shares) (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent
and that includes customary representations and warranties with respect to
ownership of the applicable security and the right to sell such security and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in
exchange for the amount of cash such Company Securityholder shall be entitled
to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(c). Upon delivery to the Paying Agent of
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, together with
any applicable Certificates and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent consistent with this Section 3.5(b) ("
_Certificate Delivery_ "), the Company Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which his, her or its
Company Common Stock (including each share of Common Stock represented by a
Vested Company RSU, but excluding shares of Company Common Stock cancelled
pursuant to Section 3.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall have been
converted pursuant to Section 3.1(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled or terminated. Each Company


 

Stockholder shall be entitled to receive payment pursuant to this Section
3.5(b) by check or, at such Company Stockholders request, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by such Company
Stockholder on the earlier of (X) the Closing Date, if such holders
Certificate Delivery occurs at or prior to 10:00 a.m. New York City time on
the Closing Date and (Y) the first Business Day after such holders
Certificate Delivery, if such delivery is made after such time. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.5(b), each Certificate shall be
deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender (or at such other applicable time) such amount to
which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant and subject to
Section 3.1(c). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable
upon surrender of any Certificate. For the avoidance of doubt, in each
instance in this Section 3.5(b), the term "Company Stockholder" shall include
holders of Company Common Stock represented by a Vested Company RSU.

(c)

_Cancellation Procedures_. Not later than the tenth Business Day prior to the
anticipated Closing Date (as mutually and reasonably determined by Parent and
the Company), the Company shall solicit, as a condition to the receipt of any
portion of the consideration to which such holder would be entitled under this
Agreement (as determined in accordance with this Agreement):

(i)

a complete, duly-executed Company Option Cancellation Agreement in the form of
_Exhibit D_ hereto from each Company Optionholder that holds a Company Option
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(ii)

a complete, duly-executed Company SAR Cancellation Agreement in the form of
_Exhibit E_ hereto from each Company SARholder that holds a Company SAR as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Upon delivery to the Paying Agent on or before the Cancellation Agreement
Deadline of a Company Option Cancellation Agreement or Company SAR
Cancellation Agreement, as applicable, duly completed and validly executed,
together with any other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent consistent with this Section 3.5(c), the Company Optionholder or Company
SARholder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash
into which his, her or its Vested Company Options or Vested Company SARs, as
applicable, shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.1(c), and the
applicable Company Options or Company SARs shall forthwith be cancelled or
terminated. Each Company Optionholder or Company SARholder shall be entitled
to receive payment pursuant to this Section 3.5(c) by check or, at such
Persons request, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated by such Person on the earlier of (X) the Closing Date,
if such holder delivered such cancellation agreement to the Paying Agent on or
prior to 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the Closing Date and (Y) the first
Business Day after such delivery, if such delivery is made after such time;
provided, however, that payment shall in no event be made later than the first
Business Day after the Cancellation Agreement Deadline. The "Cancellation
Agreement Deadline" means the later of (i) December 15, 2011 or (ii) the 10th
day of the third calendar month following the Closing Date. Until payment is
made as contemplated by this Section 3.5(c), each Company Option or Company
SAR, as applicable, shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such delivery (or at such other
applicable time) and pursuant to the terms of this Section 3.5(c) such amount
to which the holder is entitled pursuant and subject to Section 3.1(c). No
interest shall be paid or shall


 

accrue on the cash payable upon delivery of the appropriate documents (or at
such other applicable time) contemplated hereby. 

(d)

_Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed prior to the Closing Date, then, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Company Securityholder claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue in
consideration of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the portion of the
Payment Fund to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to the express
terms of this Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that, if required by the
Paying Agent and as a condition to the issuance of the relevant portion of the
Payment Fund, such holder agrees to indemnify the Paying Agent against any
claim that may be made in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and shall, upon the
request of the Paying Agent, deliver a bond in such amount as the Paying Agent
may reasonably direct against any claim that may be made against the Paying
Agent with respect to such shares.

(e)

_Stock Transfer Books_. On the day prior to the Closing Date, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books
of the Company. If, on or after the Closing Date, Certificates are presented
to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or
for any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article III.

(f)

_No Liability_. Any portion of the Payment Fund held by the Paying Agent and
unclaimed at the end of six months after the Effective Time shall be returned
to Parent, after which time any holder of unsurrendered Certificates shall
look as a general creditor only to Parent for payment of such funds to which
such holder may be due, subject to applicable Law (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any additional amounts paid to the Paying Agent pursuant
to Section 3.6(d)). None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Securityholders Representative or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

(g)

_Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or other Persons, such amounts required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, any
provision of non-U.S. state or local Tax Law or any provision of U.S. Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Tax Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or other
Persons, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

(h)

_Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and such other Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) with respect
to the transfer of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger (or another
transaction contemplated herein (other than the transactions contemplated by
Section 6.11)) (referred to herein as " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid 50%
by the Company Stockholders (it being agreed by the Securityholders
Representative that he shall pay out of the Securityholders Representative
Expense Fund such


 

amount on behalf of the Company Stockholders), on the one hand, and 50% by
Parent, on the other hand.

Section 3.6

_Post-Closing Adjustments_.

(a)

No later than the 90th day following the Closing Date, Parent will prepare and
deliver to the Securityholders Representative a consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing (the " _Closing Balance
Sheet_ "), prepared in accordance with GAAP, together with a statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Parents good faith calculation of
Closing Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, Company Transaction
Expenses, Benefits Liabilities, Closing Cash and Transaction Deductions.

(b)

The Securityholders Representative shall have 30 days following the
Securityholders Representatives receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement to deliver to Parent any objections that the Company
Securityholders may have to any of the matters set forth therein. During such
30-day period, Parent shall grant to the Securityholders Representative and
its agents and representatives, subject to any applicable privileges,
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to
the books, records and other documents (including work papers) pertaining to
or used in connection with the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and
the Closing Statement. If the Securityholders Representative does not
deliver any written objections to Parent within such 30-day period,
Securityholders Representative (on behalf of himself and the other Company
Securityholders) shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance Sheet,
the Closing Statement and the calculations set forth therein, and the
Securityholders Representative (on behalf of himself and the other Company
Securityholders) shall have irrevocably waived any right to object thereto.
If the Securityholders Representative does timely deliver such written
objections (a " _Dispute Notice_ "), which Dispute Notice specifies in
reasonable detail the nature and dollar amount of any disagreement so asserted
(collectively, the " _Disputed Items_ "), then, during the 30 days following
Parents receipt of a Dispute Notice, Parent and the Securityholders
Representative shall diligently attempt to resolve in writing the Disputed
Items. Any Disputed Item resolved in writing by Parent and the
Securityholders Representative will be deemed final, binding and conclusive
on Parent and the Company Securityholders.

(c)

If Parent and the Securityholders Representative do not reach agreement on
all of the Disputed Items during such 30-day period (or such longer period as
they shall mutually agree), then not later than five Business Days after such
period, Parent and the Securityholders Representative will submit all
unresolved Disputed Items (collectively, the " _Unresolved Items_ ") to Ernst
and Young LLP (the " _Independent Accountants_ ") to review and resolve such
matters. Each of Parent and the Securityholders Representative agrees to
execute and deliver any engagement letter reasonably required by the
Independent Accountants. The Independent Accountants will determine each
Unresolved Item (the amount of which may not be more favorable to Parent than
the related amount reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing
Statement nor more favorable to the Securityholders Representative than the
related amount set forth in the Dispute Notice) as promptly as practicable,
and Parent and the Securityholders Representative will instruct the
Independent Accountants to endeavor to complete such process within a period
of no more than 30 days. The Independent Accountants may conduct such
proceedings as the Independent Accountants believe, in their sole discretion,
will assist in the determination of the Unresolved Items; provided, however,
that, except as Parent and the Securityholders Representative may otherwise
agree, all communications


 

between Parent and the Securityholders Representative or any of their
respective representatives, on the one hand, and the Independent Accountants,
on the other hand, will be in writing with copies simultaneously delivered to
the non-communicating Party. Provided that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation have made available to the Securityholders Representative and its
representatives in a timely manner all information relating to the Closing
Statement and any Unresolved Items reasonably requested by the
Securityholders Representative, then the Independent Accountants shall make
their determination solely based on (i) the documentation submitted by, and
presentations (any such documentation or presentation must be provided to the
other Party prior to its submission or presentation to the Independent
Accountants) made by Parent and the Securityholders Representative, (ii) the
definitions of Closing Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, Company
Transaction Expenses, Benefits Liabilities, Cash and Cash Equivalents and
Transaction Deductions, and (iii) GAAP. The Independent Accountants
determination of the Unresolved Items will be final, binding and conclusive on
Parent and the Securityholders Representative, absent manifest errors on all
parties, and enforceable before a Governmental Authority, effective as of the
date the Independent Accountants written determination is received by Parent
and the Securityholders Representative. Each of Parent and the
Securityholders Representative will bear its own legal, accounting and other
fees and expenses of participating in such dispute resolution procedure. The
fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants incurred pursuant to this
Section 3.6(c) shall be split equally between Parent and the Securityholders
Representative.

(d)

Upon final determination of the adjustments to be made (if any) to the
Estimated Closing Payment pursuant to this Section 3.6 (such amount, the "
_Final Closing Payment_ "), an adjustment to the Estimated Closing Payment
will be determined and paid as follows:

(i)

If the Estimated Closing Payment exceeds the Final Closing Payment, Parent
shall be entitled to deliver written instructions to the Escrow Agent
directing the Escrow Agent to pay to Parent the amount of such excess out of
the Escrow Amount. 

(ii)

If the Final Closing Payment exceeds the Estimated Closing Payment, Parent
shall pay the applicable amount(s) to the Paying Agent, for distribution to
the Indemnifying Persons, and/or to the Surviving Corporation, for payment to
the recipients of the Benefits Liabilities (after appropriate withholdings).
Any amount payable by Parent to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section
3.6(d)(ii) will be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds within
three Business Days after the determination of Final Merger Consideration.

(iii)

Any amount to be distributed to the Indemnifying Persons pursuant to this
Section 3.6(d) shall be distributed to each applicable Indemnifying Person in
accordance with such Indemnifying Persons Pro Rata Share.

(e)

Upon final determination of the adjustments to be made (if any) to the Closing
Cash pursuant to this Section 3.6, any differences from the Estimated Cash
paid at the Closing pursuant to Section 3.4 will be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within three Business Days to the recipient and in
the manner provided in Section 3.4, either by Parent to the Paying Agent or by
a distribution of funds to Parent from the Escrow Amount pursuant to written
instructions delivered by Parent to the Escrow Agent, as applicable.


 

(f)

For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of preparing the Closing Statement
and the Closing Balance Sheet, no effect will be given to any new accounting
pronouncements that may be issued following delivery of the Estimated Closing
Payment Calculation.

other plan, policy, program practice, agreement, understanding or arrangement
(whether written or oral) providing compensation or other benefits to any
current or former director, officer, employee or consultant (or to any
dependent or beneficiary thereof) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
which is maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or under which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has or may
have any current or future material Liability, including, without limitation,
all incentive, bonus, severance, change in control, deferred compensation,
vacation, holiday, cafeteria, medical, disability, stock purchase, stock
option, stock appreciation, phantom stock, restricted stock or other stock-
based compensation plans, policies, programs, practices or arrangements (each
a " _Company Benefit Plan_ "). 

(b)

The Company has made available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of
each of the Company Benefit Plans and related plan documents (including trust
documents, insurance policies or Contracts, employee booklets, summary plan

In addition to and without limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the
Company shall (i) make or cause to be made all filings required of each of
them or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates under the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby within ten (10) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement or on such date as is agreed upon by
Parent and the Company, (ii) comply at the earliest reasonably practicable
date with any request received by either of them or any of their respective

filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, providing
copies, or portions thereof, of all such documents to the non-filing parties
prior to filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental Authority with respect to
any such filing or any such transaction. Each of Parent and the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to the other Party all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to any prohibition against disclosure under the HSR Act or
any other applicable Law, each Party shall promptly inform the other Parties
of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written communications
with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or any such
transaction. No Party shall independently participate in any formal meeting
with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filing, investigation
or other inquiry without giving the other Parties prior notice of the meeting
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity
to attend and/or participate in such meeting. Subject to the HSR Act or any
other applicable Laws, the Parties will consult and cooperate with one another
in connection with any and all analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any Party relating to proceedings under the HSR Act. Parent and
the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate
any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section
6.2(b) as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the recipients outside legal counsel
and outside experts retained for purposes of any investigation or inquiry and
shall not be disclosed by such outside counsel or outside expert to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company,
as the case may be).

to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under the HSR Act. In connection therewith, if any proceeding is instituted
(or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement as being in violation of the HSR Act, each of Parent and the
Company shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to


 

contest and resist any such proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed,
or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is
in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all
commercially reasonable avenues of administrative and judicial appeal, unless
Parent and the Company mutually agree that litigation is not in their
collective best interests. Each of Parent and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to
cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act with respect to
such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this
Agreement. In connection therewith and without limiting the foregoing, Parent
and the Company each agree to use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly
any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under the HSR Act that may be asserted by any federal, state, local or non-
United States antitrust or competition authority, so as to enable the Parties
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously
as possible, including committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, trust or otherwise the sale or disposition of such of its
assets or businesses as are required to be divested in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order, whether preliminary,
temporary or permanent, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Purchaser shall pay all filing fees in connection with the HSR
Act; all other expenses will be paid by the Party incurring such expenses.

applicable Business Employee a cash bonus award from its Closing Cash, it
being understood and agreed that the identity of each eligible Business

increase the Tax liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any
Post-Closing Tax Period or result in the Company or any Company Subsidiary
incurring a Tax outside of the ordinary course of business; and (ii) refrain
from entering into any settlement or closing agreement with a Tax Authority
that is reasonably expected to increase the Tax liability of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary for any Post-Closing Tax Period or result in the

Section 6.13

_Parachute Payment Waivers; 280G Shareholder Approval_. 

(a)

The Company shall request from each person who is entitled to receive a
payment, benefits, options or stock, or accelerated vesting from the Company
or any Company Subsidiary that is contingent on the change of control of the
Company as contemplated by this Agreement that would, if paid without
shareholder approval under this Section 6.13, be nondeductible by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary under Section 280G of the Code or subject to an
excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code, a waiver pursuant to which each
such person shall agree to waive any and all right or entitlement to the
accelerated vesting, payments, benefits, options and stock to the extent the
value thereof exceeds 2.99 times such persons "base amount" as determined in
accordance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. Each such waiver obtained shall provided that unless the
requisite shareholder approval of such accelerated vesting, payments,
benefits, options and stock is obtained pursuant to the vote solicitation
contemplated by Section 6.13(b), the waived amounts will not be paid or
otherwise provided. Each waiver that is actually obtained shall be referred
to as a " _Parachute Payment Waiver_ ". The Company shall, not later than two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, notify Parent in writing of the
"disqualified individuals" who delivered a Parachute Payment Waiver to the
Company and the "disqualified individuals" who did not


 

deliver a Parachute Payment Waiver to the Company. If a "disqualified
individual" does not deliver a Parachute Payment Waiver to the Company prior
to the Closing, the Company shall, prior to the Closing, (i) calculate the
full amount of any gross-up with respect to the excise Tax under Section 4999
of the Code that such "disqualified individual" is entitled to pursuant to any
agreement with the Company (the " _Gross-Up Amount_ "); (ii) pay the Gross-Up
Amount to the "disqualified individual;" and (iii) obtain a release of claims
from the "disqualified individual" stating that payment has been made in full
with respect to any gross-up the "disqualified individual" is entitled to with
respect to the excise Tax under Section 4999.

(b)

The Company shall prior to the Closing solicit its shareholders to approve in
a manner which satisfies all applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code the payments that were previously waived pursuant to a Parachute
Payment Waiver such that, if the requisite shareholder approval is obtained,
none of the payments or benefits waived pursuant to a Parachute Payment Waiver
that will be paid or provided to the respective "disqualified individuals"
will be nondeductible under Section 280G of the Code or subject to an excise
Tax under Section 4999 of the Code.

(c)

For purposes of determining whether to request a waiver from any person, and
what payments a person is required to waive to be no more than 2.99 times such
persons base amount, Parent shall cooperate with the Company and provide any
reasonable requested information, including providing all information
regarding any rights to amounts payable under any employment contracts or
severance plan pursuant to a contract or agreement or plan entered into with
the Parent or the Company or any Company Subsidiary on or after the Closing
Date (or at the direction of the Parent) that could be considered to be
contingent on the change of control of the Company as contemplated by this

(b)

Parent or the Company, in the event that any condition set forth in Article

reasonably capable of being satisfied, by the 180th day from the date hereof
(which date shall be extended for up to 90 days plus the number of days
contemplated by or otherwise agreed upon pursuant to Section 2.3 in the event
that any applicable review period in connection with the HSR Act has not ended

180-day period) (the date, following all such extensions, the " _Walk-Away
Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Party may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this clause (b) if the failure of the applicable
condition in Article VII, VIII or IX (as the case may be) to be satisfied or
the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Walk-Away Date referred
to in the applicable paragraph results from (i) the breach by such Party of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement or (ii)
such Partys failure to use its required efforts to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(c)

Parent, if the Company breaches any representation, warranty, covenant,

(with the cooperation of the other parties) to remove such Order or appeal
diligently such other action; and provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(e) shall not be available to

deliver written notice of such termination to each of the other Parties, and

action by any Party, except that the provisions of Sections 6.1(f), 6.4 and
this 10.2 and Articles XI and XIV shall survive the termination of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such termination shall not relieve
any Party of any liability that arose prior to the date of termination or,
with respect to those provisions that survive termination, that arises after
such termination. 

(b)

If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, each Party shall, as
requested by the applicable other Party(ies), either redeliver to such other

Closing Date, and (ii) the final date on which amounts are required to be paid
with respect to the Transaction Tax Benefit Amount pursuant to Section 12.6
and Section 12.7. All other covenants and agreements of the Parties shall not
survive this Closing and shall thereupon terminate, except that claims for
indemnification in respect of any breach thereof shall survive until the
second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date (such survival periods referred
to in this Section 11.1, the " _Survival Periods_ "). For the avoidance of
doubt, the Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that the Survival Periods are
contractual statutes of limitations and any claim brought by any Party

(i)

After the Closing no Indemnitor shall have any liability under Sections
11.2(a)(i) or 11.2(b), as applicable, with regard to an individual claim for

of Section 11.2(c)(ii).

(ii)

After the Closing no Indemnitor shall have any liability under Sections

Damages suffered by the Parent Indemnified Person(s) or Securityholder
Indemnified Person(s), as the case may be, exceeds one percent (1%) of the
Closing Payment (the " _Threshold_ "), after which all Damages above the
Threshold, plus fifty percent (50%) those Damages used to reach the Threshold,
shall be recoverable by the applicable Parent Indemnified Person(s) or
Securityholder Indemnified Person(s), as the case may be; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Threshold shall not apply to claims for indemnification
with respect to a misrepresentation or breach of, or default in connection
with any of the representations and warranties specified in Section 11.1(a),
11.1(b) or 11.1(c).

(iii)

for which Parent and Merger Sub shall be liable as an Indemnitor under Section
11.2(b) shall not exceed 10% of the Closing Payment and (B) the maximum amount

Subject to Section 11.13, the funds that comprise the Escrow Amount, at any
given time, shall be the sole and exclusive source of recovery with respect to
Damages indemnifiable pursuant to Section 11.2(a) and shall limit the
liability of the Company and Company Securityholders, and in no event shall
the Parent Indemnified Person(s) be entitled to recover, or the liability of
the Company and Company Securityholders exceed, more than the amount of the
funds available as part of the Escrow Amount at any given time.

(d)

In determining the amount of any Damage, any qualifications in the
representations, warranties and covenants contained herein with respect to a
Material Adverse Effect, materiality, material or similar terms shall be
disregarded and will not have any effect with respect to the calculation of

warranty or covenant of the Company set forth in this Agreement or in any of
the Ancillary Agreements, exhibits, schedules or certificates to, or delivered
in connection with this Agreement.

(e)

EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS, NO PARTY WILL IN ANY EVENT BE LIABLE
UNDER THIS ARTICLE XI FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR EARNINGS, DIMINUTION IN VALUE
OR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES BY REASON OF A

HEREIN.

(f)

Securityholder Indemnified Person(s) in accordance with each respective
Company Securityholders Pro Rata Share.

Section 11.3

_Reduction of Damages_. Any Damages of a Parent Indemnified Person shall be
reduced by the amount of any increased Tax refunds or any reduction of Tax
liabilities (a " _Tax Benefit_ ") actually realized by such Parent Indemnified
Person or its Affiliates as a result of such Damages. If a Parent Indemnified
Person or any of its Affiliates actually realizes any Tax Benefit that was not
included in the computation of Damages that have been paid, Parent shall pay
to the Paying Agent for the distributions to the Securityholders in accordance
with the Securityholders Pro Rata Share the amount of such Tax Benefit. The
amount of any payment for a Tax Benefit that is due under the prior sentence
shall be paid within forty-five (45) days of the due date of the Tax Return
with respect to which the Tax Benefit is realized (or, if the Tax Benefit is
in the form of an increased refund, within forty-five (45) days of the receipt
of such Tax refund from the applicable Tax Authority). Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to claim, and
cause any Parent Indemnified Person or their Affiliates to claim, any Tax
Benefit that will give rise to a reduction in Damages or a payment under
Section 11.3; provided, however, neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
any Company Subsidiary nor any of their Affiliates shall be obligated to file
an amended Tax Return (other than an amended Tax Return of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period) to claim a Tax Benefit.
Subject to the applicable limitations in this Article XI, to the extent that a
Tax Benefit that gives rise to a payment under this Section 11.3 is lost,
reduced, or


 

disallowed, the Indemnifying Persons shall indemnify the Parent Indemnified
Person for the amount of such lost, reduced, or disallowed Tax Benefit as if
such amount was a Tax incurred in a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 11.3 shall not be
construed to require Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates to make
available any information that Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates
reasonably determines in good faith is confidential or privileged (including,
without limitation, Tax Returns and related work papers (other than Tax
Returns and related work papers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period). 

Section 11.4

_Indemnification Procedure_.

(a)

_Non-Third Party Claims_. The Person seeking indemnification hereunder (the "
_Indemnitee_ ") shall notify the Party providing indemnification hereunder
(the " _Indemnitor_ ") in writing (such notice, a " _Claim Notice_ ") promptly
of the Indemnitees discovery of any matter (including if a Claim is filed
against the Indemnitee) for which the Indemnitor may be liable to the
Indemnitee under this Article XI, which Claim Notice shall specify in
reasonable detail each individual item of Damages and the nature of the breach
of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement to which each such item is
related. The failure of an Indemnitee to deliver a timely Claim Notice
hereunder shall not affect its rights to indemnification hereunder, except to
the extent that the Indemnitor is actually and materially prejudiced by such
failure to provide timely notice.

(b)

_Third Party Claims_. With respect to any Claim made by a third Person (a "
_Third Party Claim_ ") against an Indemnitee for which the Indemnitee will
seek indemnification from the Indemnitor hereunder, after delivery of the
respective Claim Notice, the Indemnitor shall be entitled (if it so elects),
at its own cost, risk and expense, (a) to take control of the defense and
investigation of such Claim, (b) to employ and engage legal counsel of its own
choice to handle and defend the same (unless the Indemnitee has been advised
by counsel that there exists an actual or potential conflict of interest
between the Indemnitee and counsel chosen by the Indemnitor (including one or
more legal defenses or counterclaims available to it or to other indemnified
parties that are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying parties) that makes it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment
of the indemnified party for the same counsel to represent both the
indemnified party and the indemnifying parties, in which event the Indemnitee
shall be entitled, at the Indemnitors cost, risk and expense, to reasonable
fees of not more than one separate counsel of the Indemnitees own choosing),
and (c) to compromise or settle such Claim, which compromise or settlement
shall be made only with the written consent of the Indemnitee, such consent
not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld, unless (A) there is no finding or
admission against Indemnitee of any violation of the rights of any Person and
it is not reasonably expected to have an effect on any other claims that may
be made against the Indemnitee, (B) the sole relief provided is monetary
damages that are paid in full by the Indemnitor, and (C) the Indemnitee will
have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Claims
effected without its consent. After notice from the Indemnitor to the
Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a Claim, the Indemnitor
will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the
Indemnitee for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to
the defense of such Claim, except as otherwise provided in this Section
11.4(b) with respect to possible conflicts of interest between the Indemnitee
and Indemnitors counsel. If the Indemnitor fails to notify the Indemnitee
that the Indemnitor will assume the defense of such Claim within sixty (60)
calendar days after


 

delivery by the Indemnitee of the Claim Notice (or such shorter period as may
be expressly specified in the underlying Claim, provided that the Indemnitee
promptly delivered the Claim Notice and underlying Claim to the Indemnitor),
the Indemnitee will (upon delivering notice to such effect to the Indemnitor)
have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such
Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnitor and
Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnitee for the reasonable expenses of
counsel engaged by Indemnitee to defend such Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, in such event, the Indemnitee shall not settle or compromise any claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Person undertaking
the defense, compromise or settlement of the Claim will keep the other Parties
reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or
settlement, and the Indemnitor and Indemnitee shall cooperate (at the
Indemnitors expense) in all reasonable respects in the investigation, trial
and defense of such Claim and any appeal arising therefrom, and the Indemnitee
may, at its own cost, monitor and further participate in the investigation,
trial and defense of such Claim and any appeal arising therefrom. To the
extent that there is an inconsistency between this Section 11.4 and Article
XII as to any Tax matter, the provisions of Article XII shall control.

Section 11.5

_No Right of Contribution_. Neither the Securityholders Representative nor
any Company Stockholder shall make any claim for contribution from the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective officers, directors or employees with respect to any indemnity
claims arising under or in connection with this Agreement to the extent that
the Company, Surviving Corporation or any Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification hereunder for such claim, and the Securityholders
Representative, on its own behalf and on behalf of all Indemnifying Persons,
hereby waives any such right of contribution from the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective officers,
directors or employees it has or may have in the future.

Section 11.6

_Effect of Investigation; Reliance_. The right to indemnification, recovery
of Damages or any other remedy will not be affected by any investigation
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy
of or compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made
by the Company or any other matter. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any such representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to
indemnification, recovery of Damages or any other remedy based on any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. No Indemnitee shall be
required to show reliance on any representation, warranty, certificate or
other agreement in order for such Indemnitee to be entitled to indemnification
hereunder.

Section 11.7

_Insurance_. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect
the proceeds of any insurance that would have the effect of reducing any
Damages, and the amount of any Damages incurred by any Indemnitee shall be
reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds actually recovered by such
indemnified party, net of all costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
expenses, incurred by such Indemnitee in recovering such proceeds from its
insurers. If indemnification payments shall have been received prior to the
collection of such insurance proceeds, such Indemnitee shall remit to the
Indemnitor the amount of such insurance proceeds thereafter received, to the
extent of indemnification payments received in respect of such Damages (in
each case, net of all costs of collection thereof, including attorneys


 

fees). To the extent an Indemnitee receives payment from a third party not
affiliated with the Indemnitee (and that is not an insurance provider) that
are related to any Damages suffered by such Indemnitee, such payment (net of
the expenses of the recovery thereof) shall be credited against any such
Damages to the extent such Indemnitee seeks indemnification in respect
thereof.

Section 11.8

_Mitigation_. The Company Indemnified Parties or Parent Indemnified Parties,
as the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Damages sustained by such Person(s). In no event shall any indemnified party
be entitled to double recovery hereunder. If any circumstance constitutes a
breach of more than one representation, warranty or covenant of an Indemnitor,
the Indemnitee(s) shall only be entitled to recover once in respect of such
circumstance.

Section 11.9

_Subrogation_. An Indemnitor shall be subrogated to the Indemnitees rights
of recovery to the extent of any Damages paid by the Indemnitor. The
Indemnitee shall execute and deliver such instruments and papers as are
necessary to assign such rights to the Indemnitor.

Section 11.10

_Tax Matters_. In addition to the other limitations contained in this
Agreement, the Indemnifying Persons obligations to pay or indemnify for any
Taxes (and related Damages) shall be further limited as follows: (i) no
Indemnifying Person shall have any responsibility to pay or indemnify for
Taxes (or related Damages) that arise or accrue during a Post-Closing Tax
Period (or Taxes attributable to the portion of any Overlap Period beginning
on the day after the Closing Date); (ii) no Indemnifying Person shall have any
responsibility to pay or indemnify for any Taxes (or related Damages) to the
extent such Tax was included as a liability (or offset to any asset) in the
computation of the Closing Working Capital or included in the computation of
Benefits Liabilities; (iii) no Indemnifying Person shall have any
responsibility to pay or indemnify for any Transfer Taxes (or related Damages)
in excess of such Indemnifying Persons 50% share as provided in Section
3.5(h); and (iv) no Indemnifying Person shall have any responsibility to pay
or indemnify for any Taxes (or related Damages) that arise from the Parents
breach of any covenant or other agreement in Article XII.

Section 11.11

_Release from Escrow_. If the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee that it does
not dispute the claim described in a Claim Notice, the Damages identified in
such Claim Notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnitor,
and, if the Indemnitee is a Parent Indemnified Person, Parent shall be
entitled in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to instruct the Escrow Agent
to release the amount of such Damages to Parent. Upon the release of any
portion of the Escrow Amount to the Indemnifying Persons as provided in the
Escrow Agreement, each Indemnifying Person will be entitled to receive a
portion of such released amount equal to his, her or its Pro Rata Share. The
Escrow Agreement will provide for (a) the release to the Paying Agent, on the
first Business Day after the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, for
distribution to the Indemnifying Persons in accordance with each respective
Indemnifying Persons Pro Rata Share, 50% of the Escrow Amount then remaining
(less amounts being held pending resolution of unresolved indemnification
claims as provided in the Escrow Agreement); (b) the release to the Paying
Agent, on the first Business Day after the second (2nd) anniversary of the
Closing Date, for distribution to the Indemnifying Persons in accordance with
each respective Indemnifying Persons Pro Rata Share, 50% of the Escrow Amount
then remaining (less amounts being held pending resolution of unresolved
indemnification claims as provided in the Escrow Agreement); and (c) the
release to the Paying


 

Agent, on the first Business Day after the third (3rd) anniversary of the
Closing Date, for distribution to the Indemnifying Persons in accordance with
each respective Indemnifying Persons Pro Rata Share, the balance of the
Escrow Amount then remaining (less amounts being held pending resolution of
unresolved indemnification claims as provided in the Escrow Agreement).

Section 11.12

_Limitations not Applicable_. None of the limitations (whether monetary,
temporal or otherwise) set forth in this Article XI shall apply to any
Damages, or any indemnification obligations relating thereto, resulting from
the fraud or intentional misconduct of any Party.

Section 11.13

_Right of Setoff_. If, after the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date,
a Parent Indemnified Person believes that it has a claim for Taxes (or related
Damages) under this Article XI in connection with U.S. federal income Taxes
payable under the Tax Indemnity, Parent shall be entitled, after delivering
written notice thereof to the Securityholders Representative, to withhold
from the amount payable to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 12.7 an amount
that, in such Parent Indemnified Persons reasonable judgment, is sufficient
to cover such Damages. Upon final determination of the amount of such
Damages, whether by a non-appealable court order or final settlement of the
dispute, the Parent Indemnified Person shall be entitled to that portion of
the withheld amount required to cure such Damages. Subject to Section 11.12,
the rights under this Section 11.13 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
any Taxes (or related Damages) payable under the Tax Indemnity that has
survived beyond the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, other than
any Taxes (or related Damages) in respect of which a claim for indemnification
has been made prior to such third anniversary and in respect of which funds
remain in escrow after such third (3rd) anniversary pursuant to Section 11.11
and the Escrow Agreement.

Section 12.2

_Preparation of Tax Returns_. The Parties hereto agree as follows:

(a)

To treat any Transaction Deductions paid or accrued on or before the Closing
Date as being deducted in a Pre-Closing Tax Period and no party hereto shall
apply (or allow the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliates to apply)
the "next day rule" under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)
to such deductions.

(b)

To make the election under Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to apply the seventy
percent (70%) safe-harbor to any "success based fee" as defined in Treasury

(c)

To the extent permitted under applicable Law, elect to carry back any net

any Company Subsidiary in a Pre-Closing Tax Period prior to carrying forward
such item into a Post-Closing Tax Period.

(d)

To treat any gains, income, deductions, losses, or other items realized by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary resulting from any transaction outside of
the ordinary course of business (excluding any such transactions resulting
from any action of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to a
contractual commitment entered into by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
prior to the Closing) and not contemplated by this Agreement (including any
relating to the financing of the acquisition of the Company by Parent) on the
Closing Date, but after the Closing, as occurring on the day after the Closing
Date and each party hereto shall (and cause the Company and each Company
Subsidiary and each other Affiliate to) utilize the "next day rule" in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or any similar provision
of state, local, or non-U.S. law) for purposes of reporting such items on
applicable Tax Returns.


 

(e)

Not to make an election under Code Section 338(g) with respect to the
acquisition of the shares of the Company contemplated by this Agreement.

(f)

Not to make an election under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2) (or
allow the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any other Affiliate to make
such an election) to ratably allocate items incurred by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

(g)

To the extent permissible under applicable Laws, to elect to have each Tax
year of the Company and any Company Subsidiary end on the Closing Date and, if
such election is not permitted or required in a jurisdiction with respect to a
Tax such that the Company or any Company Subsidiary is required to file a Tax
Return for a Overlap Period with respect to such Tax, the Parties agree to use
the following conventions for determining the amount of Taxes attributable to
the portion of the Overlap Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion
of the Overlap Period beginning on the day immediately following the Closing
Date: (A) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis, the amount attributable to the portion of the Overlap Period
ending on the Closing Date shall be determined by multiplying the Taxes for
the entire Overlap Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Overlap
Period and the remaining amount of such Taxes shall be attributable to the
portion of the Overlap Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date; and
(B) in the case of all other Taxes (including income Taxes, sales Taxes,
employment Taxes, withholding Taxes), the amount attributable to the portion
of the Overlap Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined as if the
Company or any Company Subsidiary filed a separate Tax Return with respect to
such Taxes for the portion of the Overlap Period ending on as of the end of
the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology" and the
remaining amount of such Tax for the Overlap Period shall be attributable to
the portion of the Overlap Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date.
For purposes of clause (B), any item determined on an annual or periodic basis
(including amortization and depreciation deductions) shall be allocated to the
portion of the Overlap Period ending on the Closing Date based on the relative
number of days in such portion of the Overlap Period as compared to the number
of days in the entire Overlap Period.

(h)

To treat all indemnification payments under this Agreement as adjustments to
the Merger Consideration for all relevant Tax purposes.

(i)

To treat all interest and other earnings on the Escrow Amount as income of
Parent in accordance with the transition rule set forth in Proposed Treasury

(j)

To treat the payment of the Merger Consideration as an integrated purchase and
redemption in complete redemption of each Company Securityholders interest in
the Company for U.S. federal, state and local income Tax purposes.

(k)

To treat the payments to Company Stockholders with respect to the Tax refunds
under Section 12.5, upon the release of the Escrow Funds, and with respect to
the payments of the Transaction Tax Benefit Amount under Section 12.6 as
payments of additional Merger Consideration for all relevant Tax purposes,
provided that the Purchaser and Company Stockholders shall be entitled to
treat such payments as interest to the extent required Code Section 483 or any
other analogous provision of the Code or under state or local Tax law.


 

(l)

To treat payments to Company RSUholders, Company Optionholders or Company
SARholders with respect to the Tax refunds under Section 12.5 and Section
12.7, upon the release of the Escrow Funds, and with respect to the payments
of the Transaction Tax Benefit Amount under Section 12.6 and Section 12.7
payments as payments of "wages" that are included in the income of the
relevant Company RSUholder, Company Optionholder or Company SARholder in the
year of receipt (and not in the year of deposit with the Escrow Agent) and
Parent, the Company or applicable Company Subsidiary shall be entitled to
withhold any amounts required under the Code or applicable Tax Laws with
respect to such payments in accordance with Section 3.5(g) and reduce payments
for the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys portion of payroll Taxes as
provided for in Section 12.9.

Section 12.4

_Tax Contest_. ** **

(a)

Prior to the full release of the Escrow Amount to the Securityholders
Representative pursuant to Section 11.11 and the Escrow Agreement (or if

conduct another Claim with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or
Company Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Period or (2) a notice of deficiency
for Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period, the Parent shall notify the

Agreement). If the Securityholders Representative elects to participate as
provided for in Section 12.4(a), its right to participate shall include, but

Section 12.5

_Tax Refunds_. 

(a)

Prior to the full release of the Escrow Amount to the Securityholders
Representative pursuant to Section 11.11 and the Escrow Agreement, all refunds
of Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (whether in the form of cash received or a credit or other offset
against Taxes otherwise payable) to the extent not included in the Closing
Working Capital shall be property of the Company Securityholders. To the
extent that the Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any Company Subsidiary
receives a refund that is the property of the Company Securityholders, the
Parent shall pay the amount of such refund (and interest received from the Tax
Authority) as provided in Section 12.7. The amount due for any Tax refund
shall be payable ten (10) days after receipt of the refund from the applicable
Tax Authority (or, if the refund is in the form of a credit or offset, ten
(10) days after the due date of the Tax Return claiming such credit or
offset). Subject to the applicable limitations in Article XI, to the extent
that a Tax refund that gives rise to a payment under this Section 12.5 is
lost, reduced, or disallowed, the Indemnifying Persons shall indemnify the
Parent Indemnified Person for the amount of Taxes that the Company or any
Company Subsidiary incurs as a result of such loss, reduction, or
disallowance. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
this Section 12.5 shall not be construed to require Parent, the Company or any
of their Affiliates to make available any information that Parent, the Company
or any of their Affiliates reasonably determines in good faith is confidential
or privileged (including without limitation, Tax Returns or related work
papers (other than Tax Returns and related work papers of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period)).

(b)

The amount of refunds attributable to the portion of an Overlap Period ending
on the Closing Date shall be determined in accordance with Section 12.2(a).

(c)

Prior to the full release of the Escrow Amount to the Securityholders
Representative pursuant to Section 11.11 and the Escrow Agreement, the Parent

claim a refund payable in cash from the carrying back of a net operating loss
for the tax year ending on the Closing Date and an IRS Form 4466 (and any
comparable form for state or local Tax purposes) to claim a refund payable in

Section 12.6

_Transaction Deduction Tax Benefit_.

(a)

To the extent that a Transaction Tax Benefit Amount is realized for an
Applicable Tax Year, the Parent shall pay an amount equal to such Transaction
Tax Benefit Amount as provided in Section 12.7; _provided_ , _however_ ,
Parent shall not be obligated to pay any amounts in respect of the Transaction
Tax Benefit Amount or with respect to any Tax refunds payable under Section
12.5 arising from the Transaction Deductions that would result in aggregate
payments by Parent in respect of the Transaction Tax Benefit Amount and such
refunds addressed under Section 12.5 in excess of the Transaction Tax Benefit
Cap. Any Transaction Tax Benefit Amount payable under the prior sentence
shall be payable no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date the
Transaction Tax Benefit Amount is finally determined under Section 12.6(c).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the Transaction Tax Benefit
Amount arises from a refund for Taxes (whether by direct payment or credit),
the Transaction Tax Benefit Amount shall not be payable prior to the date that
is ten (10) Business Days after Parent, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any of their Affiliates receives such refund from the applicable Tax
Authority.

(b)

Within forty-five (45) days after the Parent files an Applicable Federal Tax
Return for an Applicable Tax Year, the Parent shall deliver to the
Securityholders Representative a certificate signed by an officer of Parent
that reasonably details the calculation of the Transaction Tax Benefit Amount
realized with respect to such year (each, a " _Draft Tax Benefit Computation_
"). The Parent will make available to the Securityholders Representative and
its representatives such additional information that the Securityholders
Representative reasonably requests as part of its review of the Draft Tax
Benefit Computation. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 12.6_ shall
not be construed to require Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates to
make available any information that Parent determines in good faith is
confidential or privileged (including without limitation, any Tax Returns and
related work papers (other than Tax Returns or related work papers of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ ,
_however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, such Tax Returns and related work
papers shall not include any Tax Returns or work papers of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary)). If the
Securityholders Representative delivers notice that it agrees with the Draft
Tax Benefit Computation or does not deliver a Tax Benefit Objection Notice
within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Draft Computation, the Parents
Draft Tax Benefit Computation shall be binding and the amount of the
Transaction Tax Benefit Amount shall be payable under Section 12.6(a) and
Section 12.7. If the Securityholders Representative disagrees with any
aspect of the Draft Tax Benefit Computation, the Securityholders
Representative shall, within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Draft
Tax Benefit Computation, deliver a notice (a " _Tax Benefit Objection Notice_
") to the Parent stating that it disagrees. The Parent and the
Securityholders Representative shall use reasonable efforts to resolve any
disagreements as to the Draft Tax Benefit Computation and the Tax Benefit
Objection Notice, but if they do not obtain a final resolution within sixty
(60) days after the Parent has received the Tax Benefit Objection Notice, the
Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall jointly retain
PricewaterhouseCoopers (or successor firm that Parent generally engages to
prepare the Parents U.S. federal income Tax Returns) (the " _Parent s Tax
Accountant_") to compute the Transaction Tax Benefit Amount; provided,
however, for the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the Parents
Tax Accountant or the Parent be required to make available to the
Securityholders Representative any information that Parent reasonably
determines in good faith is confidential or privileged (including without
limitation,


 

Tax Returns and related work papers) (other than Tax Returns and related work
papers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period;
_provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, such Tax Returns and
related work papers shall not include any Tax Returns or work papers of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company or any Company
Subsidiary)). The determination of the Parents Tax Accountant shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Parent and the Securityholders
Representative. Each of Parent and the Securityholders Representative will
bear its own legal, accounting and other fees and expenses of participating in
such dispute resolution procedure. The fees and expenses of the Parents Tax
Accountant incurred pursuant to this Section 12.6(b) shall be split equally
between Parent and the Securityholders Representative.

(c)

The Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to claim any deduction
for Transaction Deduction not governed by Section 12.2 or to claim refunds
that will give rise to payments under this Section 12.6; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to file an amended Tax Return
for any Applicable Tax Year to claim a refund or to claim a deduction for a
Transaction Tax Deduction

(d)

For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be obligated to pay more
than once to, or for the benefit of, the Company Securityholders any amount
with respect to the same Tax Benefit.

Section 12.7

_Payment of Refunds and Transaction Deduction Tax Benefits_. To the extent
that any amounts are required to be paid with respect to the Transaction Tax
Benefit Amount under Section 12.6 or refunds under Section 12.5, such amounts
shall be paid as follows: (i) if such amount is payable before the full
release of the Escrow Amount to the Securityholders Representative under
Section 11.11 and the Escrow Agreement, such amount shall be deposited with
the Escrow Agent and distributed in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement and this Agreement; and (ii) if such amount is payable on or after
the full release of the Escrow Amount to the Securityholders Representative
under Section 11.11 and the Escrow Agreement, such amount shall be paid,
subject to Section 11.13, to the Paying Agent for distributions to the
Securityholders as determined by the Securityholders Representative.

Section 12.8

_Prior Tax Agreements_. The Company shall terminate or cause to be terminated
any and all of the Tax sharing, allocation, indemnification or similar
agreements, arrangements or undertakings in effect, written or unwritten, on
the Closing Date as between the Company Stockholders or any predecessors or
Affiliates thereof, on the one hand, and the Company and any of the Company
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, for all Taxes imposed by any Tax Authority,
regardless of the period in which such Taxes are imposed, and neither the
Surviving Corporation, any Company Subsidiary, nor any Company Stockholder (or
predecessors or Affiliates thereof) shall have any continuing obligation to
make any payments under any such agreements, arrangements or undertakings.

Section 12.9

_Payroll Taxes._ To the extent the Parent, the Company, or any Company
Subsidiary incurs any payroll Taxes not included in the Closing Working
Capital as a result of the application of Section 12.2(l) on the release of
the Escrow, the payment of refunds under Section 12.5 and Section 12.7; or the
payment with respect to the Transaction Tax Deduction Amount under Section
12.6 and Section 12.7, the amount payable to, or on behalf of, the
Securityholders shall be reduced by the amount of such payroll Taxes and such
amounts shall be remitted to the Parent (or its designee) to be paid to the
applicable Tax Authority.

WAIVER, (II) IT OR HE UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVER, (III) IT OR HE MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT OR HE HAS

provisions of this Agreement, may be modified, waived or amended, to the
extent permitted by Law and, if applicable, approved by the Boards of
Directors of the Company, Parent and/or Merger Sub, by an instrument or
instruments in writing signed by each of the Parties. The failure of any
Party to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be
construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the
validity of this Agreement or any part of this Agreement or the right of any
Party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. The waiver by any
Party of a breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

Section 14.8

Section 14.11

performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or
obligation, and/or (b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened
breach. Each Party further agrees that no other Party shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 14.11, and
each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. 

Section 14.12

_Conflicts and Privilege_. The Parent and the Surviving Corporation hereby
agree that, in the event a dispute arises after the Closing between Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary and the Securityholders
Representative (or any Company Securityholder), Winston and Strawn LLP may
represent the Securityholders Representative or the Company Securityholder in
such dispute even though the interests of the Securityholders Representative
or the Company Securityholder may be directly adverse to the Company, and even
though Winston and Strawn LLP may have represented the Company or a Company
Subsidiary in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be
handling


 

ongoing matters for the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates. Parent, the
Securityholders Representative and the Company further agree that, as to all
communications between Winston and Strawn LLP, the Company, the Securityholders
Representative and the Company Securityholders that relate in any way to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Securityholders
Representative and the Company Securityholders and may be controlled by the
Securityholders Representative and the Company Securityholders, and shall not
pass to or be claimed or controlled by the Surviving Corporation or Parent;
provided that neither the Securityholders Representative nor the Company
Securityholders shall waive such attorney-client privilege other than to the
extent appropriate in connection with the enforcement or defense of their
respective rights or obligations existing under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a dispute arises between the
Parent or the Company and a Person other than the Securityholders
Representative or a Company Securityholder after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by Winston and Strawn LLP to such Person; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may not waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of the Securityholders Representative,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
