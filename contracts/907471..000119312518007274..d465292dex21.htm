MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

Section 2.01. _Merger Consideration_ _._ Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and the MBCA, at the Effective Time, automatically by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Buyer Parties,
the Company Parties or any holder of their respective securities: 

(a) Each Company Common Share owned directly by Buyer, Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (other than shares in trust accounts, managed
accounts and the like for the benefit of customers) immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time without
any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ with respect to fractional
Company Common Shares, each Company Common Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares described in
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ above) shall be converted into the right to receive
such number of shares of Buyer Common Stock determined by multiplying (i) one
(1) by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (the "Merger Consideration").

(c) Each share of Buyer Common Stock shall remain outstanding without change
following the Effective Time as shares of the Surviving Entity.

Section 2.02.  _Rights as Shareholders; Share Transfers_. At the Effective
Time, all Company Common Shares, when converted in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.01_, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate or Book-
Entry Share previously evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive for each such Company Common Share, the
Merger Consideration (and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer
Common Stock as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.03_) in accordance with this
_Article_ __ _ 2_. At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Shares
shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of Company, other

fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock as set forth in  _Section_ __ _
2.03_) in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ 2_. After the Effective Time,
there shall be no registration of transfers of Company Common Shares on the
share transfer books of Company.

 

Section 2.03. _Fractional Shares_. __ Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, no fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and no certificates or
scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger. In lieu thereof, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to each Person
who would otherwise be a holder of a fractional share of Buyer Common
Stock as a result of the conversion set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.01_,
rounded to the nearest one hundredth of a share, an amount of cash (without
interest and rounded down to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying
the fractional share interest in Buyer Common Stock to which such Person
would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all Company Common
Shares held at the Effective Time by such holder) by the Purchase Price. No
such Person will be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any other rights
as a shareholder in respect of any fractional shares.

 



4 Section 2.04. _Options and Other Share_ _-Based Award_ _s._

(a) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ shall pertain to all (i)
Company Options and (ii) other share-based awards granted by Company under the
Company Equity Plans that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 

(b) _Treatment of Company Options_.

 

(i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all unvested Company Options,
whether In-the-money Company Options or Out-of-the-money Company Options,
shall become vested and exercisable with respect to all shares covered
thereby.

(ii) As of the Effective Time, (A) all In-the-money Company Options shall be
cancelled and automatically converted into the right of each holder of such
In-the-money Company Option to receive an amount in cash (without interest)
equal to the product of (1) the number of Company Common Shares underlying

required in each case by Buyer or the Exchange Agent in lieu of such
Certificate) or Book-Entry Share is surrendered for exchange in accordance
with this _Article_ __ _ 2_. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws,

deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and
withhold under applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority and upon such remittance
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer or
the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

five (45) days following the time when the Registration Statement becomes

and the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 5.04(a)(i)_, through Company
Board, recommend to its shareholders the approval of the Merger and use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit such approval by such shareholders and
such other Persons entitled to vote on these matters (including as provided
under the ESOP or applicable law with respect thereto). Subject to _Section_
__ _ 5.10_ and the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 5.04(a)(i)_,

Recommendation in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.10_, Company shall not be
required to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit shareholders to
approve this Agreement and the Merger or to use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Requisite Company Shareholder Approval to consummate the Merger;
_provided_ , _however_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this

__ _ 5.4(a)_ shall limit Companys obligation to ensure that the Company
Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and ultimately conducted for
purposes of considering and voting upon the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger)).

 

(b) _Buyer Stockholder Approval._

 

(i) Following the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall take, in accordance with
applicable Law, the applicable rules of NASDAQ Global Select and the

time when the Registration Statement becomes effective, subject to extension
with the consent of Company) solely for the purpose of considering and voting
upon the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby

Buyers stockholders in order to permit consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any adjournment or postponement

and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus shall include the Buyer Recommendation. In
the event that there is present at such meeting, in person or by proxy,
sufficient favorable voting power to secure the Requisite Buyer Stockholder
Approval, Buyer will not adjourn or postpone the Buyer Meeting unless Buyer
Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of counsel that failure to do so would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(iii) Buyer shall adjourn or postpone (and may only adjourn or postpone) the
Buyer Meeting, (1) if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally
scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Buyer Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of such meeting, (2) if on the date of such meeting Buyer has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to
obtain the Requisite Buyer Stockholder Approval or (3) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure that Buyer has determined after consultation with outside legal

supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by

 



56  stockholders of Buyer prior to the Buyer Meeting. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.04(b)_ shall limit Buyers obligation

the Buyer Meeting and the Company Meeting on the same date. Each party shall
cooperate and keep the other party informed on a current basis regarding its
solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the

Section 5.05. _Registration Statement; Proxy Statement_ _-Prospectus_ _._

(a) Buyer and Company agree to cooperate in the preparation of the
Registration Statement to be filed by Buyer with the SEC in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the
issuance of Buyer Common Stock in the Merger (including the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus and all related documents). Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to promptly deliver to Buyer such information with respect to Company,
Company Bank, their respective Affiliates and the respective holders of their
capital stock as may be reasonably requested or required in order to file the
Registration Statement or any other report required to be filed by Buyer with
the SEC, or in connection with the qualification of the issuance of the Buyer
Common Stock with respect to state securities or "blue sky" Laws, in each
case, in compliance with applicable Laws, and shall, as promptly as
practicable following execution of this Agreement, prepare and deliver drafts
of such information to Buyer to review. Each of Buyer and Company agree to use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be filed with
the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, but in any event within sixty (60) days of the date of this
Agreement, and to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the filing thereof and keep the Registration Statement
effective for so long as necessary to complete the Merger. Company agrees to
cooperate with Buyer and Buyers counsel and accountants in requesting and
obtaining appropriate opinions, consents and letters from Companys
independent auditors in connection with the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus. After the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act, Company, at its own expense, shall
promptly mail or cause to be mailed the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to its
shareholders, and Buyer, at its own expense, shall promptly mail or cause to
be mailed the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to its shareholders.

(b) The Proxy Statement-Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto and
the Registration Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of Buyer and Company agrees, as to
itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of itself for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement
is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the
time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading or (ii) the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and any amendment or
supplement thereto

 



57  will, at the date it is first mailed to shareholders or stockholders of
Company and of Buyer (or such other persons entitled to vote in respect of
matters covered thereby, including ESOP participants as applicable) or at the
time of the Company Meeting or at the time of the Buyer Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
information relating to Company or Buyer, or any of their respective
Affiliates, shall be discovered by Company or Buyer which, in the
reasonable judgment of Company or Buyer, should be set forth in an amendment
of, or a supplement to, any of the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto, and Company and Buyer shall
cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or
supplement to, the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Registration Statement
and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained
in such amendment or supplement to shareholders of Company and stockholders of
Buyer. Buyer will advise Company, promptly after Buyer receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective, of
the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of Buyer
Common Stock issuable for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of any
request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration
Statement or upon the receipt of any comments (whether written or oral) from
the SEC or its staff. Buyer will provide Company and its counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Registration Statement
and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, including any amendments or supplements
thereto, and, except to the extent such response is submitted under
confidential cover, all responses to requests for additional information by
and replies to comments of the SEC (and reasonable good faith consideration
shall be given to any comments made by Company and its counsel) prior to
filing such with, or sending such to, the SEC, and Buyer will provide Company
and its counsel with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC.

(c) Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares
of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be
approved for listing on NASDAQ Global Select, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.06. _Regulatory Filings; Consents_.

efforts to comply with the terms and conditions of such permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations and (iii) cooperate and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated as expeditiously as practicable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Buyer be required to agree to
any Burdensome Condition. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
as soon as practicable and in no event later than sixty (60) days after the
date of this Agreement, Buyer and Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file any applications, notices
and filings required in order to obtain the Regulatory Approvals and other
Governmental Authority consents and approvals required to consummate the
Merger and the Bank Merger, including any notices to or filings with the SBA,
making any notices or filings under the HSR Act, if any is required, making

connection with any application, or petition made by or on behalf of Buyer or
Company or their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) each
party hereto shall have the right to review and approve in advance all
characterizations of the information relating to such party and any of its

transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental Authority,
(C) Buyer and Company shall each furnish to the other for review a copy of
each such filing made solely in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement with any Governmental Authority prior to its filing and (D)
Buyer and Company will notify the other promptly and shall promptly furnish
the other with copies of any communication from any Governmental Authority
received by it with respect to the regulatory applications filed solely in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and its
response thereto); _provided_ , that in no event shall Buyer or Buyer Bank be
obligated to provide or otherwise disclose to Company confidential information
regarding Buyer, Buyer Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or any pending merger transaction, other than the Merger and the
Bank Merger.

(b) Each of Buyer and Company will use commercially reasonable efforts, and
each shall reasonably cooperate with the other upon request, to obtain all
Regulatory Approvals; _provided_ , that neither party nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be required to make any payment to or grant any concessions
to any third party in connection therewith. Each of Buyer and Company will,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, notify the other promptly and shall
promptly furnish the other with copies of notices or other communications
received by such

 



59  party or any of its Subsidiaries of any communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person (or another Person) is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(and the response thereto from such party, its Subsidiaries or its
representatives). Company will reasonably consult with Buyer and its
representatives so as to permit Company and Buyer and their
respective representatives to cooperate to take appropriate measures to
obtain such consents and avoid or mitigate any adverse consequences that may
result from the foregoing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude either Company or

consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of
the other, which shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld;
_provided, however_ , that (a) any such press release or public statement as
may be required by Law (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
filing with the SEC) or any listing agreement with or notice or application
to any national securities exchange may be issued or made without prior
consent of such other party (but after consultation with the other party, to
the extent practicable in the circumstances) and (b) a party may issue a
press release or make a public statement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any filing with the SEC) that is consistent with prior press releases
issued or public statements made in compliance with the first sentence of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ without such consultation. It is understood that
Buyer shall assume primary responsibility for the preparation of joint press
releases relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 5.08. _Access; Current Information_.

 

(a) For the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the
other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this
Agreement, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, each of
Buyer and Company agrees to afford the other and its officers, employees,

period prior to the Effective Time to its and its Subsidiaries books, records
(including Tax Returns and, subject to the consent of the independent
auditors, work papers of independent auditors), information technology
systems, properties and personnel and to such other information relating to
them as a party may reasonably request and the other shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide any appropriate notices to employees and/or
customers in accordance with applicable Law and its privacy policy and, during

60 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after they become available, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, Company will furnish to Buyer copies of

hereunder shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the conduct of business of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 5.08_ to the contrary,
neither Company nor Buyer shall be required to provide the other party with
access to or to disclose information that such partys or its Subsidiary
banks board of directors has been advised by counsel that such disclosure of
which to the other party would violate a confidentiality obligation or
fiduciary duty or any Law or regulation, or would result in its waiver of or
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege held by such party or its
Subsidiaries. In the event any of the restrictions in this _Section_ __ _
5.08(e)_ shall apply, each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide or obtain appropriate consents, waivers, decrees and approvals
necessary to satisfy any confidentiality issues relating to documents

in such partys Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to correct any
information in such partys Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered
materially inaccurate thereby (a "Schedule Supplement"). The delivery of any
Schedule Supplement shall not cure any breach by, or modify any representation
or warranty of, this Agreement by the party delivering such Schedule
Supplement.

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_, Company shall not, and shall cause

advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants, affiliates or other agents of
Company or any Subsidiary of Company (collectively, the

knowingly induce or encourage, or knowingly take any action to facilitate the
making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could

in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, its officers, directors, employees and advisors or Buyer)
regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to
any Person (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, its officers, directors,
employees and advisors or Buyer) any non-public information or data with
respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release any Person from, waive any provisions of,

behalf of Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement by Company. Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause each
of the Company Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all existing discussions, negotiations, and communications
with any Persons with respect to any existing or potential Acquisition
Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 5.10(a)_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, prior to the date of the Company Meeting, Company may take any of
the actions described in _Section_ __ _ 5.10(a)_ if, but only if, (A)
Company has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that
did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_; (B) Company Board
reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of its outside financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that (1) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to take such
actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Companys
shareholders under applicable Law; (C) Company has provided Buyer with at
least three (3) Business Days prior notice of such determination; and (D)
prior to furnishing or affording access to any information or data with
respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, Company receives from such Person a confidentiality
agreement with terms no less favorable to Company than those contained in the
confidentiality agreement with Buyer (it being understood that nothing therein
shall have the effect of a standstill provision). Company shall promptly
provide to Buyer any non-public information regarding Company or its
Subsidiaries provided to any other Person which was not previously provided to
Buyer, such additional information to be provided no later than the date
of provision of such information to such other party.

 



62 (c) Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Buyer in
writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any information is
requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated
or continued with, Company or the Company Representatives, in each case in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the
name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such
proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and conditions
of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials relating to
such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussion,
providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other electronic
communications) except to the extent that such materials constitute
confidential information of the party making such offer or proposal under an
effective confidentiality agreement). Company agrees that it shall keep Buyer
informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and terms of any such
proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions (including
any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer or request).

 

(d) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.10(e)_, neither Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall: (i) withhold, withdraw, change, qualify, amend or
modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, change, qualify, amend or modify, in
a manner adverse in any respect to the interest of Buyer, in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), or
take any other action or make any other statement inconsistent with, the
Company Recommendation, fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation within
three (3) Business Days following a request by Buyer, or make any statement,
filing or release, in connection with the Company Meeting or otherwise,
inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (it being understood that taking
a neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
shall be considered an adverse modification of the Company Recommendation);
(ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal; (iii) resolve to take, or announce an intention to take, any of the
foregoing actions (each of (i), (ii) or (iii) a "Company Subsequent
Determination"); or (iv) enter into (or cause Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle,

abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 5.10(d)_, prior to the date of the
Company Meeting, Company Board may make a Company Subsequent Determination
after the fifth (5th) Business Day following Buyers receipt of a notice (the
"Notice of Superior Proposal") from Company advising Buyer that Company Board
has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it
received (that did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _
5.10)_ constitutes a Superior Proposal if, but only if, (i) Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the
advice of outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to
take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
Companys shareholders under applicable Law (it being understood that the
initial determination under this clause (i) will not be considered a Company
Subsequent Determination), (ii) during the five (5) Business Day period after
receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal by Buyer (the "Notice Period"),
Company and Company Board shall have cooperated and negotiated in good 

 



63  faith with Buyer to make such adjustments, modifications or amendments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable Company to proceed
with the Company Recommendation without a Company Subsequent Determination;
_provided_ , _however_ , __ that Buyer shall not have any obligation to
propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and (iii) at the end of the Notice Period,
after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms, if
any, as may have been proposed by Buyer since its receipt of such Notice of
Superior Proposal, Company Board has again in good faith made the
determination (A) in clause (i) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10(e)_ and (B) that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event of any
material revisions to the Superior Proposal, Company shall be required
to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal to Buyer and again comply with
the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10(e)_, except that the Notice
Period shall be reduced to three (3) Business Days.

 

(f) Notwithstanding any Company Subsequent Determination, this Agreement shall
be submitted to Companys shareholders at the Company Meeting for the purpose
of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger) and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve Company of such obligation; _provided_ , _ however_ , __ that if
Company Board shall have made a Company Subsequent Determination with respect
to a Superior Proposal, then Company Board may recommend approval of such
Superior Proposal by the shareholders of Company and may submit
this Agreement to Companys shareholders without recommendation, in which
event Company Board shall communicate the basis for its recommendation of such
Superior Proposal and the basis for its lack of a recommendation with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to Companys
shareholders in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto.

 

Section 5.11. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, and in
any event subject to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 5.11(b)(iii)_, Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and former directors and
officers of the Company Parties (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, or liabilities incurred in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative arising out of actions or omissions
of such Persons in the course of performing their duties for Company or
Company Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries occurring at or before
the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) (each a "Claim"), to the same extent as such Persons have the right
to be indemnified pursuant to Companys articles of incorporation and bylaws
in effect on the date of this Agreement, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and in connection with any such Claim promptly advance expenses
from time to time as incurred, to the same extent as such Persons have the
right to expense advancement pursuant to Companys articles of incorporation
and bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, _provided_ , the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides
a reasonable and customary undertaking (which shall not include posting of
any collateral) to repay such advances, if it is ultimately determined that
such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

 



64 (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall promptly notify Buyer upon learning of any Claim,
_provided_ , that failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation of
Buyer under this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_, unless, and only to the extent that,
Buyer is materially prejudiced in the defense of such Claim as a consequence.
In the event of any such Claim (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time), (i) (A) Buyer shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof and Buyer shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for
any legal expenses or other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof,
unless such Indemnified Party is advised in writing by counsel that the
defense of such Indemnified Party by Buyer would create an actual or potential
conflict of interest (in which case, Buyer shall not be obligated to reimburse
or indemnify any Indemnified Party for the expenses of more than one such
separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties, in addition to one local counsel
in the jurisdiction where defense of any Claim has been or is to be asserted),
and (B) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such
matter, (ii) Buyer shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent and Buyer shall not settle any Claim without such
Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (iii) Buyer shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party if such indemnification would be in
violation of any applicable federal or state banking Laws or regulations,
or in the event that a federal or state banking agency or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnified
Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Laws and
regulations, whether or not related to banking Laws.

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Buyer will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to purchase and provide directors and
officers liability insurance (herein, "DandO Insurance") that serves to
reimburse the present and former officers and directors of Company or
its Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims
against such directors and officers arising from acts and omissions occurring
before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby),
which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and
contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties,
as that coverage currently provided by Company, _provided_ that, if Buyer is
unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this _Section_ __ _
5.11_, Buyer will provide as much comparable insurance as is reasonably
available (subject to the limitations described below in this _Section_ __ _
5.11(c)_); and  _provided_ , _further_ , that officers and directors of
Company or its Subsidiaries may be required to make application and provide
customary representations and warranties to the carrier of the DandO Insurance
for the purpose of obtaining such insurance. In no event shall Buyer be
required to expend for such tail insurance a premium amount in excess of an
amount equal to 200% of the annual premium paid by Company for DandO Insurance
in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum DandO Tail Premium").
If the aggregate cost of such tail insurance exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail
Premium, Buyer shall obtain tail insurance coverage or a separate tail
insurance policy with the greatest coverage available for an aggregate cost
not exceeding the Maximum DandO Tail Premium for, in the case of a tail
insurance policy, the aggregate Maximum DandO Tail Premium for the 6-year
period). At the option of Company, prior to the Effective Time and in lieu of
the foregoing insurance coverage, Company may, purchase a tail policy for
directors and officers liability insurance on the terms described in this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.11(c)_ (including subject to the aggregate Maximum DandO Tail

 



65  Premium, except if one or more directors elects to pay for any excess over
such amount) and fully pay for such 6-year policy prior to the Effective
Time, in which event Buyers obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.11(c)_
shall be fully satisfied. If such prepaid tail policy has been obtained by
Company prior to the Effective Time, Buyer will not, and will not permit any
of its Affiliates to, take any action that would reasonably be expected to
result in the cancellation or modification of such policy.

(d) If Buyer or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate with
or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5.11_.

(e) These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended
to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party. After the
Effective Time, the obligations of Buyer under this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any Indemnified Party unless the affected Indemnified Party shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification. If any Indemnified
Party makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ that is denied by Buyer, and a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such
indemnification or advancement of expense, in whole or in part, then Buyer or
the Surviving Entity shall pay such Indemnified Partys costs and expenses,
including legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with enforcing such
claim against Buyer.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ is not prior
to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

Section 5.12. _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Employees of Company and Company Bank shall be retained as "at will"
employees of the Surviving Entity or Buyer Bank after the Effective Time as
employees of Buyer or Buyer Bank. In addition, Company and Company Bank agree,
upon Buyers reasonable request, to facilitate discussions between Buyer and
Company employees a reasonable time in advance of the Closing Date regarding
employment, consulting or other arrangements to be effective prior to or
following the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, any interaction
between Buyer and Company employees shall be coordinated by Company or Company
Bank.

 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, or is otherwise determined
in writing by the Buyer no less than ten (10) days preceding the Closing
Date, not later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, Company
shall take all action required to (i) cause any Company Benefit Plan that has
liabilities in respect of its participants, to 

 



66  be fully funded to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer; (ii) terminate via
duly adopted resolution all such Company Benefit Plans, including any
nonqualified deferred compensation plans or arrangements Company 401(k) Plan
and the ESOP, effective immediately prior to Closing and fully vest each
participant in any unvested account balances thereunder; and (iii) commence
the process to pay out any vested benefits thereunder to participating and
eligible Company employees in such form or forms as Company or Company Bank
reasonably determined under the applicable Company Benefit Plans and as
permitted or required under applicable Law.

 

(c) The ESOP shall be terminated via duly adopted resolution the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "ESOP Termination Date"). On or
prior to the ESOP Termination Date, Company shall direct the ESOP trustee to
remit a sufficient number of unallocated shares of the Company Common Shares
held by the ESOPs suspense account to Company or any other lender (as
applicable) to repay the full outstanding balance of the ESOP loan(s). None of
the unallocated shares used to repay the ESOP loan(s) will be entitled to
receive any Merger Consideration. On or prior to the ESOP Termination Date,
the Company shall make a contribution to the ESOP and/or take such other
actions as requested by Buyer for prior years hires in connection with the
ESOP, as amended and restated effective January 1, 2016, in either case as may
be directed by Buyer. All remaining unallocated Company Common Shares and
other unallocated plan assets, if any, held by the ESOP shall be allocated
among the participant accounts on the ESOP Termination Date in accordance with
the terms of the ESOP, and, as of the Closing, all Company Common Shares held
by the ESOP shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. As soon as administratively feasible following the Closing
Date, the account balances of the ESOP shall be distributed in accordance
with the terms of the ESOP and the requirements of the Code and ERISA. Company
shall adopt the necessary amendment(s) and board resolution(s) to effect the
provisions of this Section 5.12(b), upon prior written notice and consent
of Buyer. From the date of this Agreement until the ESOP Termination Date,
contributions by Company to the ESOP shall continue to be accrued and made in
accordance with the terms of the ESOP except as otherwise directed by Buyer in
accordance with this clause (c).

Section 5.13. _Notification of Certain Changes_. Buyer and Company shall
promptly advise the other party of any change or event having, or which could
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect or which it believes
would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its or its respective Subsidiaries
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein, which reasonably
could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the
failure of a condition in _Article_ __ _ 6_ to be satisfied on the Closing
Date, _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing with respect to any change or event shall not be deemed to
constitute a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_, or otherwise constitute
a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each
case unless the underlying change or event would independently result in a
failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.01_, 
_Section_ __ _ 6.02_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ to be satisfied on the Closing
Date.

Section 9.07. _Entire Agreement_ ; _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules hereto) represent the entire
agreement of the parties hereto and thereto with reference to the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and supersede any and all other oral or
written agreements heretofore made among the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement. Except for the Indemnified Parties
rights under

 



95   _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ and shareholders of Company with respect to _Article_
__ _ 2_, each of the Buyer Parties and each of the Company Parties hereby
agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set
forth herein and therein are solely for the benefit of the other applicable
parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement,
and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person
(including any Person or employees who might be affected by _Section_ __ _
5.12_), other than the parties hereto, any rights or remedies hereunder,
including, the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set
forth herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto
may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 

Section 9.08. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and,
unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the
parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of
the Merger that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not
render invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only as broad as is enforceable.

 

Section 9.09. _Enforcement of this Agreement; Submission to Jurisdiction_. The
parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or other equitable
relief, without the necessity of proving actual monetary loss or posting any
bond or other security, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
identified in this _Section_ __ _ 9.09_, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties (i)
irrevocably submits itself to the personal jurisdiction of all state and
federal courts sitting in the State of Delaware, including to the
jurisdiction of all courts to which an appeal may be taken from such courts,
in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
facts and circumstances leading to its execution or performance, (ii) agrees
that all claims in respect of any such action, suit or proceeding must be
brought, heard and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware ( _provided_ that, in the event that subject matter
jurisdiction is declined by or unavailable in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, then such action, suit or proceeding shall be heard
and determined exclusively in any other state or federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware), (iii) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such
courts, (iv) agrees not to bring any action, suit or proceeding against the
other party or its Affiliates arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any facts and
circumstances leading to its execution or performance in any other courts,
and (v) waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
action, suit or proceeding so brought.

 



96  Each of the parties agrees to waive any bond, surety or other security that
might be required of any other party with respect to any such action, suit or
proceeding, including any appeal thereof. Each of the parties agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 9.06_ shall be effective service of process for any action,
suit or proceeding brought against it by the other party in connection with
this _Section_ __ _ 9.09_, _provided_ that nothing contained herein shall
affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 9.10. _Interpretation_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to sections, exhibits or
schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or Exhibit or schedule
to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and
captions and headings contained in this Agreement are included solely for
convenience of reference and shall be disregarded in the interpretation
of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The parties acknowledge and agree that if an
unreasonable condition is imposed on a consent, such consent will be deemed to
have been withheld.

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and the other agreements and documents contemplated
herein. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises under any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement or
document contemplated herein, this Agreement and such other agreements or
documents shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties thereto, and
no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring
any party by virtue of authorizing any of the provisions of this Agreement or
any other agreements or documents contemplated herein.

(c) Any reference contained in this Agreement to specific statutory or
regulatory provisions or to any specific Governmental Authority shall include
any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder and any successor statute or
regulation, or successor Governmental Authority, as the case may be. Unless
the context clearly indicates otherwise, the masculine, feminine, and neuter
genders will be deemed to be interchangeable, and the singular includes the
plural and vice versa.

 

(d) Unless otherwise specified, the references to "Section" and "Article" in
this Agreement are to the Sections and Articles of this Agreement. When used
in this Agreement, words such as "herein", "hereinafter", "hereof", "hereto",
and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole, unless the context
clearly requires otherwise. When used in this Agreement, references to (i)
"in respect of debt previously contracted" and similar phrases include actions
taken in respect thereof such as foreclosure and similar proceedings and
arrangements and (ii) "foreclosure" include other similar proceedings and
arrangements including a deed in lieu.

Section 9.11.  _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any
of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties, and any purported assignment in violation of
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



97 Section 9.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or by electronic data file and in one or more counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. Signatures delivered by facsimile
or by electronic data file shall have the same effect as originals.

 

Section 9.13. _Disclosure Schedules_. The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Section or subsection of either the Company Party
Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Party Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) the
representations and warranties or covenants, as applicable, of the relevant
party that are contained in the corresponding Section or subsection of this
Agreement and to any other representations, warranties or covenants of such
party that are contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of
that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
other non-corresponding representations, warranties and covenants would be
readily apparent to a reasonable Person who has read that reference and such
representations, warranties or covenants without any independent knowledge on
the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed. The mere
inclusion of an item in either the Company Party Disclosure Schedule or the
Buyer Party Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation, warranty
or covenant shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
