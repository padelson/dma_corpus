the Company or any Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or former director,
officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary or any predecessor in
business (collectively, the "Company Employees") or spouse, child or dependent
thereof, or with respect to which the Company or any Subsidiary has any
liability (contingent or otherwise), which is not an ERISA Plan (the "Non-ERISA
Plans"); provided, however, that there shall be no obligation hereunder to
schedule any Non-ERISA Plan that is not material. No agreement, commitment or
obligation exists to adopt any new Non-ERISA Plan.

     (b) The Company has made available to the Buyer in the Data Room true and
correct copies of each of the following:

          (i) the documents constituting and governing each Non-ERISA Plan
     listed in Schedule 4.14(a) (including, but not limited to all notices,
     announcements, details of amendments or enhancements, and explanatory
     literature of current effect);

     authority in the relevant jurisdiction with respect of each of the

     (d) Each Non-ERISA Plan currently complies and has complied in the past,
both as to form and operation, in all material respects with its terms and with
the requirements of the relevant taxation and other applicable authorities and
applicable law, and benefits under the Non-ERISA Plans are as represented in
such plan documents.

     (e) In relation to each Non-ERISA Plan which has specific assets held in
trust in advance relating to any obligation to provide benefits thereunder (a
"Funded Plan"), except as would not reasonably be expected to result in any
non-de minimus liability, all contributions and other payments due from the
Company or any Subsidiary have been paid to the Funded Plan and to the knowledge
of the Company, nothing has occurred or become known since the effective


                                       26
<PAGE>
date of the last actuarial valuation of each of the Funded Plans disclosed
pursuant to Section 4.14(c)(iv) above which might reasonably be expected to
cause the result of a valuation carried out at the date of the Agreement,
adopting the same actuarial methods and assumptions as were adopted for the
purposes of the relevant disclosed valuation to be materially different, in an
adverse manner, from the result of the valuation.

     (f) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.14(f): (i) no benefit available to

or otherwise communicated to the Company Employees (or any affected group
thereof) any plan, arrangement or commitment, whether legally binding or not, to

or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary. There is no action, suit or
claim, other than routine claims for benefits, pending or threatened with
respect to any Non-ERISA Plan, or against the assets of any Non-ERISA Plan of
which the Company or any Subsidiary is a trustee, the Company or any Subsidiary.
To the knowledge of the Company, there is no action, suit or claim, other than
routine claims for benefits, anticipated, pending or threatened with respect to
the fiduciaries of any Non-ERISA Plan or the assets of any Non-ERISA Plan of the

established, maintained or contributed to by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate,
to which the Company or any Subsidiary had an obligation to contribute during
the five years preceding the date hereof, or with respect to which the Company
or any Subsidiary has any liability (contingent or otherwise) (all such plans,
collectively, the "ERISA Plans"); provided, however, that there shall be no
obligation hereunder to schedule any Non-ERISA Plan that is not material.

     (b) The Company has made available to the Buyer true and correct copies of
the following:


                                       27

     or any similar governmental entity relating to any material compliance
     issues in respect of any ERISA Plan.

     (c) No non-exempt prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section 406
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code has occurred with respect to any ERISA Plan
that is a Pension Plan that has had or would reasonably be expected to result in
a material liability.

     (d) None of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is now contributing, or
has an obligation to contribute, or has ever contributed or has had an
obligation to contribute, to a "Multiemployer Plan" (as defined in Section 3(37)
of ERISA), to the extent that there remains any unsatisfied liability with
respect thereto.

     (e) No ERISA Plan that is a Pension Plan is subject to Section 302 of
ERISA, Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA. No ERISA Plan that is a
Pension Plan is a multiple employer plan as defined in Sections 4063 or 4064 of
ERISA.

     (f) There is no action, suit or claim pending (other than routine claims
for benefits) or that reasonably could be expected to be asserted against any
ERISA Plan or the assets of any ERISA Plan. No civil or criminal action brought

both as to form and operation, in all material respects, with the terms of such
ERISA Plans and with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Laws. All necessary


                                       28
<PAGE>
governmental approvals for the ERISA Plans have been obtained and a favorable
determination as to the qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code of each
of the ERISA Plans that are Pension Plans and of each amendment thereto has been
made by the IRS and a recognition of exemption from federal income taxation
under Section 501(a) of the Code of each of the funded ERISA Plans that are
Welfare Plans, if any, has been made by the IRS. Nothing has occurred since the
date of each such determination or recognition letter that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect such qualification or exemption.

     (h) No agreement, commitment, or obligation exists to materially increase
any benefits under any ERISA Plan or to adopt any new ERISA Plan.

     (i) No ERISA Plan provides for post-employment health, life insurance or
other welfare benefit coverage, other than as may be required under "COBRA"
pursuant to Part VI of Title I of ERISA or solely during a specified severance
period.

     (j) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, no event has occurred and
no condition exists, with respect to any Pension Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA, that would reasonably be expected to subject the Company or its
Subsidiaries, either directly or by reason of their affiliation with any ERISA
Affiliate, to any tax, fine, lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA,
the Code or other applicable Laws, rules and regulations.

     (k) Except as otherwise disclosed on Schedule 4.15(k), there will be no
payment, accrual of additional benefits, acceleration of payments or vesting of
any benefit under any contract, agreement, plan or other arrangement, whether or
not an ERISA Plan, and no employee, officer or director of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries will become entitled to severance, termination pay or similar
payments or benefits or be entitled to treat himself as redundant or otherwise
dismissed or released from any obligation, solely by reason of entering into or
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone
or in combination with any other event), other than as specifically provided for
in this Agreement. No payment, accrual of additional benefits, acceleration of
payments or vesting of any benefit under this Agreement, any ERISA Plan or
Non-ERISA Plan or similar agreement or arrangement between the Company or any of
its Affiliates and any "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
Section 280G of the Code) could reasonably be expected to be characterized as an
"excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G of the Code)
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in
combination with any other event).

SECTION 4.16. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW; EXPORT CONTROL LAWS.

other than fines not to exceed $250,000 in the aggregate. The Company and the
Subsidiaries are in material compliance with the terms of all applicable export
licenses or other approvals. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.16(b), there are

against the Company or the Subsidiaries with respect to such export licenses or
other approvals. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no actions,

other material Taxes that have become due or payable, including without
limitation all Taxes that the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is obligated to

interest and penalty in connection therewith, for all periods ending on or prior

                                       35
<PAGE>
Company Registered Marks. Except as may be set forth in Schedule 4.22(a)(2), all
Company Registered Marks have been registered or obtained in accordance with all
applicable legal requirements and are currently in compliance in all material
respects with all legal requirements (including the timely post-registration
filing of affidavits of use and incontestability and renewal applications) other
than any requirement that, if not satisfied, would not result in a cancellation,

Company Registered Marks. The Company Registered Marks are valid, subsisting
and, to the knowledge of the Company, enforceable, and no notice or claim
challenging the validity or enforceability or alleging the misuse of any of the
Company Registered Marks have been received by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Except as may be set forth in Schedule 4.22(a)(2), (i) neither the

form appearing in, and in connection with, the goods and services listed in
their respective registration certificates and applications therefor,
respectively.

     (c) Actions to Protect Trade Secrets. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has taken the steps necessary to maintain the confidentiality of
all material information that at such time constituted a Trade Secret of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, all current and former employees, consultants and contractors of the
Company or of any of its Subsidiaries who have participated in the creation of
any material Intellectual Property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in

information, confidentiality and assignment agreements substantially similar to
the Company's standard forms of such agreements.

and its Subsidiaries own exclusively all right, title and interest to the
Company Registered Marks and all other Intellectual Property used by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Intellectual Property licensed to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by a third party pursuant to a written
license agreement), free and clear of any Liens or other adverse claims or
interests, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice or claim challenging the Company's or such Subsidiary's ownership
of any of such Intellectual Property. None of such Intellectual Property owned
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order,
judgment, or stipulation restricting the use thereof by the Company or such
Subsidiary.

operations and that are licensed for a license fee, or for which the Company

of its Subsidiaries under any Inbound License Agreement is pending or reasonably
foreseeable or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. There is no
outstanding or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened dispute or
disagreement with respect to any Inbound License Agreement or Outbound License
Agreements that could materially affect any of the respective rights and
obligations of the parties thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Company of this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, will not result in the loss or impairment of, or give rise
to any right of any third party to terminate or reprice or otherwise modify any
of the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' rights or obligations under any
Inbound License Agreement or any Outbound License Agreement.

     (f) No Infringement. To the knowledge of the Company and its Subsidiaries,

materials or other Intellectual Property used, displayed, published, sold,
distributed or otherwise commercially exploited by or for the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has infringed upon, misappropriated, or violated, or does
infringe upon, misappropriate or violate any Intellectual Property of any third
party in any material respect, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any notice or claim asserting that any such
infringement, misappropriation or violation is occurring or has occurred. To the
knowledge of the Company and its Subsidiaries, no third party is
misappropriating or infringing any material Intellectual Property owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any material respect.

court or administrative agency, or any other restriction that would interfere
with the use of his or her best efforts to carry out his or her duties for the
Company or to promote the interests of the Company or that would conflict with
the Company's business. To the knowledge of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, at no

knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, there exist no inventions
by current and former employees or consultants of the Company, made or otherwise

SECTION 7.1. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

     The representations and warranties of the Sellers and the Company contained
in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects when made and true
and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date (except that the

and correct in all respects at and as of the Closing Date) with the same effect
as though made at and as of such time (except that those representations and

as of such date); provided, however, that this condition will be deemed to be
satisfied if such untrue or incorrect representations and warranties (without
regard to materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications) at and as of
the Closing Date do not, individually or in the aggregate, have or would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Sellers
and the Company shall have duly performed and complied in all material respects
with all covenants and agreements required by this Agreement to be performed by
him, her or it at or prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer shall have been
furnished with certificates of the Company, dated the Closing Date, certifying
in such detail as the Buyer reasonably may request to the fulfillment of the
foregoing conditions.

SECTION 7.2. LEGAL MATTERS.

shall have been terminated, and/or the relevant antitrust Governmental Authority
shall have issued or deemed to have issued an approval, clearance or
authorization under the antitrust laws of the jurisdictions identified in
Schedule 7.2, except where the failure to wait for the expiry of the waiting
period or the failure to obtain such approval, clearance or authorization would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or on the Buyer (for the
purposes of Section 7.2(a) only, Material Adverse Effect will be defined as
applying equally to the Buyer) such Material Adverse Effect being presumed with
regard to the filings in the US, the EU, Canada, Israel, and South Africa, and
would not expose any of the parties' officers or directors to criminal liability
by such Governmental Authorities; and


                                       52
<PAGE>
     (b) No Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any Law that has the effect of permanently making the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements illegal
or otherwise requiring the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries including for these
purposes the Company and the Subsidiaries to sell divest, transfer, dispose of
or otherwise hold separately any of their assets, businesses, product lines, or

agreement with any Seller who is an employee of the Company relating to such
person's employment by the Company.

     (b) Pursuant to Section 14.1 thereof, the Investment Agreement will
terminate on the Closing Date with no liability or accrued liability to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder other than the payment of the
following fees (the "Fees"): (i) the annual fee provided for under Section 10.3
of the Investment Agreement for the period from October 16, 2004 through and
