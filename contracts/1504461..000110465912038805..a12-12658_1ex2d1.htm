shall thereupon cease. HSE shall be the surviving entity in the

      
 

 



 

Merger (sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Company_ ") and shall
continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and the separate
existence of HSE, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger.

take place at 11:00 a.m. (Chicago, Illinois time) on a date to be specified by
NGL and HSE, which date shall be no later than the third Business Day after

Approval and the Subordinated Unitholder Approval, the " _Unitholder
Approvals_ "), but other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing (but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions), unless another time or date, or both, are agreed to in writing by
the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing is held is herein referred
to as the " _Closing Date_." The Closing will be held at the offices of

of Merger_ "), which filing shall be made on the Closing Date.

 



 

SECTION 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. From and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth under the DRULPA and the LLC Act.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 **EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF THE 
CONSTITUENT COMPANIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

 



 

SECTION 2.1. _Effect on Ownership Interests_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any equity
interests of HSE or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of HSE Units_. Subject to _Section 2.1(e) and (f)_, each HSE
Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the
right to receive the following consideration (the " _LP Consideration_ "):

 



 

(i) Subject to _Section 2.1(f)_, each HSE Unit shall be converted into the
right to receive (A) an amount equal to the Cash Purchase Price (as defined in
_Section 2.1(d)_ below) _divided_ _by_ the total number of HSE Units
outstanding at Closing (on a fully-diluted basis) (the " _LP Cash
Consideration_ "), and (B) a number of units representing limited partnership
interests of NGL (" _NGL Common Units_ ") (rounding to the nearest ten-
thousandth of an NGL Common Unit) equal to (x) (1) the Equity Consideration
Amount (as defined below) _divided_ _by_ (2) $21.50; _divided_ _by_ (y) the
total number of HSE Units outstanding at Closing (on a fully-diluted basis)
(the " _LP Equity Consideration_ "). For the purposes of this Agreement, the "
_Equity Consideration Amount_ " shall mean a dollar amount equal to (A) (i)
the Total Consideration Amount _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) 0.82, _minus_ (B) the
Cash Purchase Price (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event the Equity Consideration Amount is a negative amount (the " _Deficiency_
"), the Cash Purchase Price shall be reduced by such Deficiency and the Equity
Consideration Amount shall be deemed zero.

 



 

(ii) Each HSE Unit converted into the right to receive the LP Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ shall cease to be outstanding and shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of an HSE Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether certificated or non-
certificated and represented in book-entry form) shall thereafter cease to be
a limited partner of HSE or have any rights with respect to such HSE Units,
except the right to receive the LP Consideration.

 



 

(b) _HSE General Partner Units_. Each issued and outstanding general
partnership interest of HSE (" _HSE General Partner Unit_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
in the Surviving Company in the form as set forth in the Surviving Company
Partnership Agreement, and the HSE General Partner, as the holder of such
general partner interest, shall continue as the sole general partner of the
Surviving Company as set forth in the Surviving Company Partnership Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Limited Liability Company Interests; Admission
of General Partner and Limited Partner_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of NGL or any of its
Subsidiaries (i) HSE General Partner shall be admitted to the Surviving
Company as the sole general partner as described in

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 2.1(b)_, (ii) NGLs limited liability company interest in Merger
Sub shall be converted into and become a 99% limited partner interest in the
Surviving Company, and NGL shall be admitted to the Surviving Company as the
sole limited partner, and (iii) HSE shall continue without dissolution.
Immediately after the Effective Time, such general partner interest and
limited partner interest referred to in the preceding sentence will constitute
the only outstanding partnership interests in the Surviving Company. At the
Effective Time, General Parter and NGL shall be automatically bound by the
Surviving Company Partnership Agreement and the books and records of the
Surviving Company shall be revised to reflect the admission of HSE General
Partner and NGL as the sole general partner and sole limited partner,
respectively, of the Surviving Company and the withdrawal, immediately
following such admissions, of all Limited Partners as limited partners of the
Company.

 



 

(d) _Cash Purchase Price_. For purposes hereof, the " _Cash Purchase Price_ "
shall be $100,000,000.00. The Cash Purchase Price shall consist of the Cash
Sale Consideration and the Cash Distribution Consideration.

 



 

(e) _Adjustments_. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, the outstanding equity interests of NGL or HSE, including securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for equity interests of NGL or
HSE, shall be changed into a different number of units, shares or other
securities by reason of any split (including reverse split), combination,
merger, consolidation, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or
other similar transaction, or any distribution payable in any equity interests
in the equity interests of NGL or HSE shall be declared thereon with a record
date within such period, the Aggregate Merger Consideration (as defined
below), the exchange ratios and any other similarly dependent items described
herein, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of interests of the NGL or HSE the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event, and as so adjusted shall,
from and after the date of such event, be the Aggregate Merger Consideration,
the applicable exchange ratio or other dependent item, as applicable, subject
to further adjustment in accordance with this sentence; _provided_ , _however_
, that nothing herein shall be construed to permit the HSE Group Entities to
take any action with respect to their securities that is expressly prohibited
by _Section 5.1_.

 



 

(f) _Adjustment for Non-Accredited Investors_. In the event there are more
than thirty-five (35) HSE Unitholders (as defined in _Section 2.3(a)_) that
certify they do not qualify as, or NGL does not reasonably believe to be,
"accredited investors" (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated
under the Securities Act) (the " _Non-Accredited Investors_ "), then,
notwithstanding _Section 2.1(a)(i)_ to the contrary, the LP Consideration
payable with respect to each HSE Unit held by a Non-Accredited Investor shall
be comprised solely of cash in an amount equal to (A) (i) the Total
Consideration Amount _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) 0.82, _divided by_ (B) the number
of HSE Units outstanding as of the Closing (the " _Additional Non-Accredited
Investor Cash Amount_ "); _provided_ , in no event shall NGL be obligated to
make the additional cash amount payable to the Non-Accredited Investors in the
event the Additional Non-Accredited Investor Cash Amount is in excess of
$5,000,000. For purposes of _Section 2.1(a)(i)_, the Cash Purchase Price
shall be increased by the aggregate amount of the Additional Non-Accredited
Investor Cash Amount paid pursuant to the foregoing sentence, if any, and the
Equity Consideration Amount shall be reduced by the total amount of such
Additional Non-Accredited Investor Cash Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event the Additional Non-

 



      
 

 



 

Accredited Investor Cash Amount would exceed $5,000,000, HSE may elect to
allocate a portion of the Cash Consideration equal to such excess (up to an
additional $5,000,000) to the Non-Accredited Investors and allocate a
corresponding portion of the Equity Consideration Amount equal to such excess
to all other HSE Unitholders. For purposes hereof, any HSE Unitholder who has
not delivered a duly executed Questionnaire to NGL as of the day before
Closing shall be deemed a "Non-Accredited Investor" hereunder.

 



 

(g) _Non-Vested HSE Units_. Any unvested HSE Units (including HSE Restricted
Units) outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be deemed terminated,
cancelled and forfeited without any further action of the Parties.

 



 

(h) _Distribution Waiver_. As a condition precedent to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereunder, and without any further action of the
Parties hereto, if the Closing occurs in or after the fiscal quarter of NGL
ending June 30, 2012, each holder of NGL Common Units issued pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)(i)_ shall be, with respect to such NGL Common Units, (i)
deemed to have waived any right to receive any distribution declared and paid
by NGL for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2012, and (ii) entitled to
receive one-third of any distribution declared and paid for the fiscal quarter
of NGL ending June 30, 2012.

 



 

SECTION 2.2. _Total Consideration Amount_. No later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, HSE shall prepare and deliver to NGL a good faith
calculation of the Total Consideration Amount (including Net HSE Indebtedness
and HSE Transaction Expenses). Such calculation shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to NGL. In the event NGL disagrees with such
calculation, the Parties shall work together in good faith to resolve any such
dispute and shall not consummate the Closing until resolution thereof. The
Cash Purchase Price shall be deposited on the Closing Date by NGL with the
Paying Agent (as defined herein).

 



 

SECTION 2.3. _Surrender and Payment of Consideration for HSE Units_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, NGL shall designate a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to HSE to act as agent for the holders of
HSE Units (the " _HSE Unitholders_ ") in connection with the Merger (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") to receive, for the benefit of the HSE Unitholders the LP
Cash Consideration and the LP Equity Consideration (collectively, the "
_Aggregate Merger Consideration_ "). The LP Cash Consideration shall be
deposited with the Paying Agent as provided in this Agreement. The LP Cash
Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall, pending its disbursement
to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by NGL. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on
deposit with the Paying Agent will be payable to NGL or as NGL otherwise
directs. Any net loss resulting from such amounts on deposit will be
replenished by NGL.

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedures for HSE Units_. As promptly as practical after the
date hereof, HSE shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding HSE Units (the " _Certificates_ "), whose HSE Units will, upon the
Effective Time, be converted into the right to receive a portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_, (x) a letter of
transmittal in substantially the form attached hereto as **_Exhibit C_**
(which shall specify that delivery shall be

 



      
 

 



 

effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent), (y) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of such
portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration as determined by this _Section
2_ and (z) an accredited investor questionnaire to determine whether each such
holder is an "accredited investor" under Regulation D of the Securities Act in
substantially the form attached hereto as **_Exhibit D_** (a "
_Questionnaire_ "). Upon the later of (A) surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and
such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent), and a duly completed and validly executed Questionnaire, and (B) 24
hours following the Effective Time, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefore, a portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ in exchange for each HSE Unit
formerly represented by such Certificate. If payment of any portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of a portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration to
a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Company
or NGL that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable; _provided_ ,
further, in the event that Material HSE Unitholders deliver a joint written
instruction to NGL certifying that one such Material HSE Unitholder wishes to
receive a greater percentage of its Aggregate Merger Consideration in the form
of LP Cash Consideration and the other in an equal dollar amount of LP Equity
Consideration, NGL covenants and agrees to cause such allocation of LP Cash
Consideration and LP Equity Consideration among such Material HSE Unitholders
to be effectuated; _provided_ , for claritys sake, in no event shall the
aggregate LP Consideration payable under _Section 2.1(a_) be increased or
decreased as a result of such written instruction. If a holder provides wire
transfer instructions in the letter of transmittal, the Paying Agent (or NGL
at its election) shall pay the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration
to which such holder is entitled by wire transfer to the designated account;
if no such instructions are provided, the Paying Agent (or NGL at its
election) shall mail the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration to
which such holder is entitled by mail to such address as is set forth in the
letter of transmittal, or if no such address is provided, to the address of
such holder as set forth on HSEs books and records. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.3_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive a portion
of the Aggregate Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_,
without interest. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms
hereof, the Paying Agent shall return all Certificates which have been
surrendered to the Paying Agent to the holders of such Certificates who
surrendered such Certificates to the Paying Agent.

 



 

(c) _No Further Registrations_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration or transfer of HSE Units. If, after the Effective Time,
any Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for a portion of Aggregate Merger Consideration in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 2.3_.

 



 

(d) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Company and NGL shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise payable to any
holder of HSE Units

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this Agreement only such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. If the Surviving Company or NGL, as
the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the HSE Units
in respect of which the Surviving Company or NGL, as the case may be, made
such deduction and withholding. In connection with any such withholding, all
such amounts shall be withheld first, from the LP Cash Consideration payable
to such holder and thereafter, from the LP Equity Consideration otherwise
payable to such holder.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and
the provision of an indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, all in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to NGL, the Surviving Company will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, a portion of the Aggregated Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the HSE Units represented by such
certificate.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Paying Agent Accounts_. At any time following 180 days
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any remaining funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto), and thereafter holders of HSE Units shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
the payment of any Aggregate Merger Consideration that may be payable upon
surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of NGL free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) _Fractional Units_. No certificates representing fractional NGL Common
Units or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof). In
lieu of such fractional share interests, NGL shall pay to each such HSE
Unitholder an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (y)
the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled, _by_ (z) $21.50.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HSE**

 



 

Except as disclosed in the HSE Disclosure Schedule, HSE represents and
warrants to the NGL Group Entities as of the date hereof and as of the Closing
Date as set forth below. Such representations and warranties of HSE shall
terminate as of the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 3.1. _Organization; Qualification_.

 



 

(a) Each HSE Group Entity has been duly formed and is validly existing and in
good standing under the applicable Law of each entitys jurisdiction of
formation with all requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to
own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as presently conducted. Each HSE Group Entity is duly
qualified and in good standing as a foreign entity to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing, holding or operating of its properties makes such qualification
necessary, except such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
in good standing would not have a HSE Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Each HSE Group Entity has heretofore made available to NGL a complete and
correct copy of its partnership agreement, limited liability company
agreement, certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as applicable.

 



 

SECTION 3.2. _Authority; No Violation; Consents and Approvals_.

 



 

(a) HSE and the HSE General Partner, subject to the Unitholder Approvals, have
all requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to enter into this
Agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance by
HSE and the HSE General Partner of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized by all requisite
action on the part of HSE and the HSE General Partner, and no other corporate,
company, shareholder, partnership or similar proceeding on the part of HSE,
the HSE General Partner or any Affiliate thereof is necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except the Unitholder
Approvals. Upon receipt of the consent to the transactions contemplated
hereunder by the Significant HSE Unitholders (as hereafter defined), no
further consents of the HSE Unitholders are required for consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereunder.

 



 

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by HSE and the HSE
General Partner and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
hereof by the other Parties, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement
of HSE and the HSE General Partner, enforceable against HSE and the HSE
General Partner in accordance with its terms (except insofar as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law)).

 



 

(c) Neither the execution and delivery by HSE or the HSE General Partner of
this Agreement, nor the consummation by HSE or the HSE General Partner of the
transactions contemplated hereby nor the performance by HSE or the HSE General
Partner under this Agreement will (a) violate, conflict with or result in a
breach of any provision of the HSE LP Agreement or the HSE General Partner LLC
Agreement, respectively; (b) require any consent, approval, authorization or
permit of, registration, declaration or filing with, or notification to, any
Governmental Authority (each, a " _Governmental Authorization_ "), other than
any notices or filings pursuant to applicable Antitrust Laws as contemplated
by _Section 5.2_ of this Agreement, the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, any such filings and
approvals that may be required to be made or obtained under the securities or

 



      
 

 



 

"Blue Sky" laws of various states in connection with the issuance of the NGL
Common Units pursuant to this Agreement, or any Governmental Authorization
that may be obtained after the Closing without penalty; (c) other than as set
forth on _Section 3.2(c) of the HSE Disclosure Schedule_, require any consent
or approval of any counterparty to, or violate or result in any breach of or
constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would become a default) under, or give to others any right of termination,
cancellation, amendment or acceleration of any obligation or the loss of any
benefit under, any Contract or Permit (as defined in _Section 3.6(b)_ below);
(d) result in the creation of an Encumbrance upon or require the sale or give
any Person the right to acquire any of the assets of HSE or restrict, hinder,
impair or limit the ability of HSE to carry on the Business; or (e) violate or
conflict with any Law applicable to HSE.

 



 

SECTION 3.3. _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) All of the issued and outstanding general partnership interests of HSE are
owned by the HSE General Partner. All of the issued and outstanding limited
partnership interests of HSE are owned by the Persons set forth on _Section
3.3(a) of the HSE Disclosure Schedule_, including a description of the type of
limited partnership interest held, the number of units and the dollar value
thereof. HSE has delivered to NGL a true and correct listing of all holders of
Units (and number of Units held thereby) as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) (i) There are no outstanding options, warrants, subscriptions, puts, calls
or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments (pre-emptive,
contingent or otherwise) obligating HSE to offer, issue, sell, redeem,
repurchase, otherwise acquire or transfer, pledge or encumber any equity
interest in HSE, except for the Fisher Put; (ii) there are no outstanding
securities or obligations of any kind of HSE that are convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for any equity interest in HSE, and HSE does not
have any obligation of any kind to issue any additional securities or to pay
for or repurchase any securities; (iii) there are not outstanding any equity
appreciation rights, phantom equity, profit sharing or similar rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments based on the value of the equity, book
value, income or any other attribute of HSE, except for the Marcum Payments;
(iv) there are no outstanding bonds, debentures or other evidence of
Indebtedness of HSE having the right to vote (or that are exchangeable for or
convertible or exercisable into securities having the right to vote) with the
holders of equity interests in HSE on any matter; and (v) except as set forth
in the limited partnership agreement for HSE, there are no unitholder
agreements, proxies, voting trusts, rights to require registration under
securities Laws or other arrangements or commitments to which HSE is a party
or by which any of its securities are bound with respect to the voting,
disposition or registration of any outstanding securities of HSE.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth on _Section 3.3(c) of the HSE Disclosure Schedule_,
HSE does not have any outstanding loans or advances or capital contributions
to, or investments in, any corporation, partnership or other Person (other
than the HSE Group Entities). _Section 3.3(c) of the HSE Disclosure Schedule_
sets forth any outstanding loans or advances between or among the HSE Group
Entities, other than in the Ordinary Course of Business.

 



 

(d) Except for issued and outstanding HSE Common Units, there are no issued
and outstanding HSE Parity Units.

 



       
 

 



 

SECTION 3.4. _Financial Statements_. Attached hereto as _Section 3.4 of the
HSE Disclosure Schedule_ are the audited consolidated financial statements of
HSE as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and the
unaudited consolidated financial statements of HSE for the three-month period
ending March 31, 2012 (collectively, the " _Financial Statements_ "),
including all related notes and schedules thereto. The Financial Statements
fairly present in all material respects the financial position of HSE, as of
the respective dates thereof, and the results of operations, cash flows and
changes in members equity of HSE for the periods indicated (in the case of
interim financial statements, subject to normal year-end adjustments and the
absence of financial footnotes), and have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except, in

to such partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the

occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence of which, would cause
any representation or warranty made by such party contained in this Agreement
to be untrue, and (iv) any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this

SECTION 5.6. _D andO Indemnification and Insurance_.

Group Entity (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such and against all Losses claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, Losses, and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or
investigation (and regardless of whether any claim is asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time) (each a "Claim") to the fullest
extent (A) required by HSE Charter Documents or any Employment Agreement as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and (B) permitted under applicable Law.
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any Indemnitee becomes involved
in any capacity in any Claim then from and after the Effective Time, the

other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation
incurred in connection therewith) promptly after statements therefore are
received (unless the Surviving Company shall elect to defend such Claim),

the amounts so advanced in the event of final non-appealable determination by

Subsidiary thereof shall be liable for any settlement effected without the
prior written consent of the Surviving Company. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Section 5.6_ to the contrary, in no event shall the Surviving Company
or any Subsidiary thereof be obligated to indemnify any Indemnitee for any

with respect to those persons who are currently covered by HSEs directors
and officers liability insurance policy (a correct and complete copy of which
has been heretofore made available to NGL), on terms with respect to such
coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to HSEs directors and officers
currently covered by such insurance than those of such policy in effect on the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall the
Surviving Company be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to
200% of current annual premiums paid by HSE for such insurance. Each of HSE
and NGL shall share equally the costs of such premiums and HSEs portion shall
be included as a "HSE Transaction Cost" hereunder.

jointly and severally pay the HSE Transaction Expenses; _provided_ , _further_
, that such holders shall not be required to pay any such HSE Transaction

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

 **TAX MATTERS**

 



 

SECTION 8.1. _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Parties intend to treat the transactions contemplated by Article II as
an "assets-over" partnership merger within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), whereby (i) first, the holders of HSE Common Units
(including HSE Subordinated Units and HSE Restricted Units that vest at
Closing) are treated as selling a portion of the HSE Common Units to NGL in
exchange for the Cash Sale Consideration in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(4), (ii) second, HSE is treated as contributing
to NGL an undivided interest in each of HSEs assets pursuant to Section 721
of the Code in exchange for the Equity Consideration Amount and the Cash
Distribution Consideration, and (iii) third, HSE is treated as liquidating and
distributing the Cash Distribution Consideration and the Equity Consideration
Amount to the holders of HSE Common Units (including HSE Subordinated Units

 



       
 

 



 

and HSE Restricted Units that vest at Closing). To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Cash Distribution Consideration shall be treated as a
reimbursement of a portion of HSEs pre-formation capital expenditures
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-4(d). The Parties agree to
report consistent with this _Section 8.1(a)_ on all relevant tax returns
(including the Partnership Tax Returns (as defined below)), except as
otherwise required by a determination, as defined in Section 1313 of the Code.

 



 

(b) NGL shall, within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date, prepare and
deliver to the Agent for its review and approval a purchase price allocation
among HSEs assets consistent with the principles of Sections 704(b) and 1060
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the
"Allocation") and the Agent shall have thirty (30) days following delivery of
the Allocation to object to the Allocation. If the Agent objects to the
Allocation and NGL and the Agent cannot come to a mutually agreeable
resolution regarding such objection, NGL and the Agent shall select a mutually
agreeable third-party public accounting firm to resolve such objection and any
other disputes relating to the Allocation. Upon agreement of NGL and the Agent
or determination of the third-party public accounting firm with respect to the
Allocation, NGL and the Agent agree (A) to file all tax returns consistently
with the Allocation, and (B) that neither Party or any of their respective
Affiliates or direct or indirect owners shall take a position on any tax
return, or before any Governmental Authority in connection with the
examination of a tax return or in any judicial proceeding, that is in any
manner inconsistent with the terms of the Allocation, except as required by a
determination, as defined in Section 1313 of the Code. If, any Governmental
Authority makes or proposes an allocation different from the Allocation, NGL
and the Agent shall cooperate with each other in good faith to contest such
Governmental Authoritys allocation (or proposed allocation), provided,
however, that, after consultation with Agent and the Party (or Parties)
adversely affected by such allocation (or proposed allocation), the other
Party (or Parties) hereto or Agent on behalf of HSE may file such protective
