2.1 _Conversion of Membership Interests_.

 

(a) _Membership Interests of the Company_. Each membership interest of the
Company (the " _Membership Interests_ ") held by New Holdco issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the
Effective Time automatically be converted into the right to receive (subject
to _Section 2.1(f)_) (i) an amount equal to the Aggregate Cash Merger
Consideration, _divided by_ the total number of Fully-Diluted Common Shares,
in cash, without interest, (ii) the Aggregate Stock Merger Consideration,
_divided by_ the total number of Fully-Diluted Common Shares and (iii) if and
when payable in respect of such Membership Interests in accordance with
_Section 2.8_, the Per Share Earn-Out Value, and thereafter shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled, and shall cease to exist
after the Effective Time (the " _Total Consideration_ "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof if
New Holdco would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock it shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the
nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of (x) such
fraction, multiplied by (y) the Parent Stock VWAP.

(b) _Common Shares of New Holdco_. Pursuant to the Distribution and
Liquidation Agreement, each holder of shares of voting common stock of the
Company, no par value (including, after the Companys conversion into a
limited liability company as contemplated by the Pre-Closing Restructuring,
the voting common stock of New Holdco, " _Voting Common Stock_ "), and each
holder of shares of nonvoting common stock of the Company, no par value
(including, after the Companys conversion into a limited liability company as
contemplated by the Pre-Closing Restructuring, the nonvoting common stock of
New Holdco, " _Nonvoting Common Stock_ " and, together with the Voting Common
Stock, the " _Common Stock_ "), including, for the avoidance of doubt, each
holder of unvested Restricted Shares, issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall receive a distribution from New
Holdco with respect to such shares consisting of such holders _pro rata_
share of the Installment Obligation (as defined herein) such that each such
holder shall receive from Parent (i) five (5) Business Days following the
Closing (A) the Aggregate Cash Merger Consideration, _divided by_ the total
number of Fully-Diluted Common Shares, in cash, without interest (the " _Per
Share Cash Merger Consideration_ ") and (B) the Aggregate Stock Merger
Consideration, _divided by_ the total number of Fully-Diluted Common Shares
(the " _Per Share Stock Merger Consideration_ " and, together with the Per
Share Cash Merger Consideration, the " _Per Share Closing Merger
Consideration_ ") and (ii) if and when payable in respect of such share in
accordance with _Section 2.8_, the Per Share Earn-Out Payment; _provided_ ,
if at any time during the period between the date hereof and the Closing, in
the case of the foregoing clause (i)(B), or, if at any time prior to the date
of the payment of the Earn-Out Amount pursuant to _Section 2.8_, in the case
of the foregoing clause (ii), there is a change in the number of issued and
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock, or securities convertible or
exchangeable into shares of Parent Common Stock, in each case, as a result of
a reclassification, stock split, stock combination, stock dividend or stock
distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, extraordinary dividend or
distribution, or any rights offering, or other similar transaction, the Per
Share Stock Merger Consideration and Per Share Earn-Out Payment, as
applicable, shall be equitably adjusted to provide the Shareholders with the
same economic effect based on the numbers of shares of Parent Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to such event. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, no fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will
be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each former holder of
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all such shares of Parent Common Stock
that would otherwise be received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an
amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal
to the product of (x) such fraction, multiplied by (y) the Parent Stock VWAP.

(c)  _Membership Interests of Merger Sub_. Each membership interest of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into, and be exchanged for, one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable membership interest of the Surviving Company at
the Effective Time.

(d) _Treatment of Options and Transaction Bonus Units_. For purposes of this 
_Section 2(d)_, each reference to the number of Common Shares underlying each
Option and Transaction Bonus Unit shall be deemed, from and after the Pre-
Closing Restructuring, to refer to the equal number of Membership Interests of
the Company into which Common Shares of the Company shall have been converted
in connection with the Pre-Closing Restructuring.

(i)  _Generally_. At the Effective Time, with respect to each outstanding
Option, whether vested or unvested, such Option shall be deemed to be a "
_Rollover Option_ " unless, with respect to any Vested Option, the holder
thereof elects to receive the Per Share Closing Merger Consideration in
respect of such Vested Option and satisfies the Cash-Out Option Conditions not
less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (any Vested Option
as to which such election has been timely made, a " _Cash-Out Option_ ").

(ii) _Cash-Out Options_. Each Cash-Out Option that is issued and outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically, and without
further action by the Company, any Option Holder or any other person, be
canceled and converted into the right to receive for each Common Share
previously subject to the Cash-Out Option:

(A) (1) cash in an amount equal to the excess of the Per Share Cash Merger
Consideration over the Exercise Price, and (2) the Per Share Stock Merger
Consideration which Per Share Stock Merger Consideration shall be subject to
the transfer restrictions set forth in the Transfer Restriction Agreement (the
payment under this clause (A), the " _Closing Option Payment_ "); and

(B) if and when payable in respect of such Cash-Out Option in accordance
with  _Section 2.8_, the Per Share Earn-Out Payment.

(iii) _Rollover Options_. Each Rollover Option that is issued and outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically, and without
further action by the Company, any Option Holder or any other person, be
canceled and converted into:

 

(A) a non-qualified option (an " _Adjusted Parent Option_ "), granted under
Parents 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended, or any successor plan, to
purchase the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares) equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Common Stock subject to such Rollover Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio, which
Adjusted Parent Option shall have an exercise price per share of Parent Common
Stock equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained
by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to such
Rollover Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) the Option
Exchange Ratio; and

 

(B) if and when payable in respect of such Rollover Option in accordance with
_Section 2.8_, the Per Share Earn-Out Payment.

 



5

    

For purposes of this _Section 2.1(d)_, the " _Option Exchange Ratio_ " shall
equal the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) obtained by dividing (i)
the fair market value of the Per Share Closing Merger Consideration (as
determined by mutual agreement of Parent and the Company in good faith if such
determination occurs prior to the Closing or, if such determination occurs
after the Closing, by mutual agreement of Parent and the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company in good faith) by (ii) the average of the daily volume
weighted average price per share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange (or on the principal exchange on which the shares of Parent Common
Stock are then traded) for each of the thirty (30) consecutive days on which
the New York Stock Exchange (or such other exchange) is open for trading
ending on the Closing Date (in each case, as reported by the New York Stock
Exchange or, if unavailable, by another authoritative source) and excluding
any day prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Closing Parent VWAP_ ").
Adjusted Parent Options (and rights to a Per Share Earn-Out Payment (if and
when payable in accordance with _Section 2.8_)) issued in respect of Unvested
Options shall be subject to the same restrictions and vesting that were
applicable to the associated Unvested Options immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that such vesting shall be no more frequently than
quarterly (provided that such quarterly vesting schedule shall not result in a
delay of any installments that would otherwise have vested monthly).
Furthermore, twenty percent (20%) of the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Adjusted Parent Options will be subject to the
transfer restrictions set forth in the Transfer Restriction Agreement. The
Per Share Earn-Out Payment in respect of any Rollover Option that is an
Unvested Option shall (if and when payable in accordance with _Section 2.8_)
become payable by Parent promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) days)
following (x) the date, if any, that the Per Share Earn-Out Payments are made
to the Shareholders in accordance with _Section 2.8_ or (y) if later, the
dates, if any, that such Unvested Option would have become vested under the
terms in place for such Unvested Option immediately prior to or at the
Effective Time. The Company acknowledges and agrees that no Adjusted Parent
Options issued hereunder will qualify as "incentive stock options" within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code.

(iv) _Vested Transaction Bonus Units_. Each Vested Transaction Bonus Unit
that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically, and without any further action by the Company, any
Transaction Bonus Unit Recipient or any other person, be canceled and
converted into the right to receive, for each Common Share previously subject
to the Vested Transaction Bonus Unit:

(A) (1) cash in an amount equal to the excess of the Per Share Cash Merger
Consideration over the Deemed Exercise Price, _plus_ (2) the Per Share Stock
Merger Consideration (the payment under clause this (A) in respect of each
Transaction Bonus Unit, the " _Closing Transaction Bonus Unit Payment_ ");
and

(B) if and when payable in respect of such Vested Transaction Bonus Unit in
accordance with _Section 2.8_, the Per Share Earn-Out Payment.

(v) _Unvested Transaction Bonus Units_. Each Unvested Transaction Bonus Unit
that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically, and without further action by the Company, any
Transaction Bonus Unit Recipient or any other person, be canceled and
converted into a Parent Restricted Unit that entitles the holder to receive
upon vesting, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this _Section
2.1(d)(v)_:

 



6

    

(A) a number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of (1) the Per Share Stock
Merger Consideration, and (2) the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration, _less_
the Deemed Exercise Price of such Transaction Bonus Unit, _divided by_ the
Parent Stock VWAP; and

(B) if and when payable in respect of each Transaction Bonus Unit that is
replaced by such Parent Restricted Units in accordance with _Section 2.8_,
the Per Share Earn-Out Payment (the payment under clause (A) and this clause
(B), in respect of each Transaction Bonus Unit, the " _Transaction Bonus Unit
Payment_ ").

 

Such Parent Restricted Units (and any right to receive a Transaction Bonus
Unit Payment thereunder) shall be subject to the same restrictions and vesting
that were applicable to the associated Transaction Bonus Units immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that such vesting shall be no more
frequently than quarterly. Furthermore, twenty percent (20%) of the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)(iv)(A)_ will be
subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the Transfer Restriction
Agreement. The Transaction Bonus Unit Payments made pursuant to _Section
2.1(d)(iv)(A)_ shall become payable by Parent promptly (and in any event
within thirty (30) days) following the dates, if any, that such Parent
Restricted Units become vested under the terms in place for the associated
Transaction Bonus Units immediately prior to or at the Effective Time, except
that such vesting shall be no more frequently than quarterly. The Transaction
Bonus Unit Payments equivalent to the Per Share Earn-Out Payment shall (if and
when payable in accordance with _Section 2.8_) become payable by Parent
promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) days) following (x) the date, if
any, that the Per Share Earn-Out Payments are made to the Shareholders in
accordance with _Section 2.8_ or (y) if later, the dates, if any, that such
Parent Restricted Units become vested under the terms in place for the
associated Transaction Bonus Unit Payments immediately prior to or at the
Effective Time. No Parent Restricted Unit, or right to any Transaction
Bonus Unit Payment thereunder, or right thereto, may be pledged, encumbered,
sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by operation of law) by
any person, other than Parent, or be taken or reached by any legal or
equitable process in satisfaction of any liability of such person, prior to
the distribution to such person of such Transaction Bonus Unit Payment in
accordance with this Agreement.

 

(vi) From and after the Effective Time, the Options shall no longer be
exercisable by the former Option Holders thereof for Common Shares, but shall
only entitle such Option Holders to the consideration set forth in this
_Section 2.1(d)_ and _Section 2.3_ in respect of the Options held by them.

 

(e) _Treatment of Phantom Awards_. For purposes of this _Section 2(e)_, each
reference to the number of Common Shares underlying each Phantom Share Award
shall be deemed, from and after the Pre-Closing Restructuring, to refer to the
equal number of Membership Interests of the Company into which Common Shares
of the Company shall have been converted in connection with the Pre-Closing
Restructuring.

(i) _Vested Phantom Awards_. Each Vested Phantom Share Award that is issued
and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall entitle
any employee or other service provider party to the effective Phantom Share
Agreement in respect of such award (" _Phantom Award Holder_ ") to receive for
each Common Share subject to the Vested Phantom Share Award:

 



7

    

(A) (1) cash in an amount equal to the excess of the Per Share Cash Merger
Consideration over the Phantom Exercise Price, _plus_ (2) the Per Share Stock
Merger Consideration which Per Share Stock Merger Consideration shall be
subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the Transfer Restriction
Agreement (the payment under clause (A), the " _Closing Phantom Award
Payment_ "); and

(B) if and when payable in respect of each Common Share subject to such
Vested Phantom Share Award in accordance with _Section 2.8_, the Per Share
Earn-Out Payment.

(ii) _Unvested Phantom Share Awards_. Each Unvested Phantom Share Award that
is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically, and without further action by the Company, any Phantom Award
Holder or any other person, be forfeited and canceled. Parent agrees to grant
to each holder of a forfeited Unvested Phantom Share who is employed by the
Company at the Effective Time and executes and delivers to Parent a Phantom
Share Cancellation Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ the
number of Parent Restricted Units set forth across from such holders name in
_Section 2.1(e)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, with each Parent
Restricted Unit entitling the holder to receive upon vesting, in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this _Section 2.1(e)(ii)_:

(A) a number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of (1) the Per Share
Stock Merger Consideration, and (2) the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration,
_less_ the Deemed Exercise Price of such Parent Restricted Unit, _divided by_
the Parent Stock VWAP; and

(B) if and when payable in respect of such Parent Restricted Unit in
accordance with _Section 2.8_, the Per Share Earn-Out Payment (in respect of
each Unvested Phantom Share Award, the " _Parent Award Payment_ ").

 

Such Parent Restricted Units (and any right to receive the Parent Award
Payment thereunder) shall be subject to the vesting schedule set forth
opposite the applicable holders name in _Section 2.1(e)(ii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. The portion of each Parent Award Payment described in
clause (A) of this _Section 2.1(e)(ii)_ shall become payable by Parent
promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) days) following the dates, if
any, that the corresponding Parent Restricted Units become vested. The Parent
Award Payments equivalent to the Per Share Earn-Out Payment shall (if and
when payable in accordance with _Section 2.8_) become payable by Parent
promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) days) following (x) the date, if
any, that the Per Share Earn-Out Payments are made to the Shareholders
in accordance with _Section 2.8_ or (y) if later, the dates, if any, that
the corresponding Parent Restricted Units become vested. Furthermore, twenty
percent (20%) of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to 
_Section 2.1(e)(ii)(A)_ will be subject to the transfer restrictions set
forth in the Transfer Restriction Agreement. No Parent Restricted Unit, or
right to any Parent Award Payment thereunder, may be pledged, encumbered,
sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by

 



8

    

 operation of law), by any person, other than Parent, or be taken or reached
by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any liability of such
person, prior to the distribution to such person of such Parent Award Payment
in accordance with this Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, no payment shall be made in respect of any
Phantom Share Award with a per share Phantom Exercise Price that exceeds the
sum of the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration and the Dollar Value of Per
Share Stock Merger Consideration.

 

(f) Parent shall be obligated to deliver to New Holdco the portion of the
Total Consideration consisting of (i) the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration
_times_ the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Per Share Stock Merger
Consideration _times_ the number of shares of Common Stock issued
and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time five (5)
Business Days after the Closing Date (subject to the final sentence of
_Section 2.1(b)_ and the proviso in the penultimate sentence thereof).
Parents obligation to deliver the amounts described in the immediately
foregoing sentence as well as the Per Share Earn-Out Payment, if and when
payable in accordance with _Section 2.8,_ _times_ the number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the "Installment Obligation") shall be divisible and transferrable by
New Holdco to its shareholders pursuant to the Distribution and Liquidation
Agreement.

 

(g) _Further Actions_. The Companys board of directors shall, prior to the
Closing, (i) approve the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.1_, which
approval shall include the items set forth in _Section 2.1(g)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and (ii) provide all Company Option holders with any
notices required under the Company Stock Plan, so that, following the
Effective Time, there shall be no outstanding Company Equity Awards (vested or
unvested) or obligations or liabilities to holders of Company Equity Awards,
other than payment of the consideration or the grant of Adjusted Parent
Options or Parent Restricted Units as set forth in this _Article II_. The
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review such
resolutions and other documents in respect of the actions set forth in this 
_Section 2.1(g)_ (including in _Section 2.1(g)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) reasonably in advance, and shall consider in good faith any comments
timely provided by Parent. As soon as practicable following the Closing
Date (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days following the Closing
Date), Parent shall file or have on file a registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor form or other appropriate form), with respect to the
issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Parent
Restricted Units and Adjusted Parent Options, and shall use its reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the Parent Restricted Units and
Adjusted Parent Options remain outstanding.

 

2.2 _Shareholder Representative Expense Amount_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Agreement, on the Closing
Date $1,000,000 of the Aggregate Cash Merger Consideration will be deducted
from the Aggregate Cash Merger Consideration otherwise to be paid to the
Shareholders, and such amount shall be paid by Parent to a bank account
designated by the Shareholder Representative (the " _Shareholder
Representative Expense Amount_ "). The Shareholder Representative Expense
Amount shall be held and used by the Shareholder Representative for its costs
and expenses incurred in connection with its services as the Shareholder
Representative under this Agreement.

issue Parent Common Stock in book-entry form (or, at the option of Parent, 

 



12

    

 certificates) in an amount equal to the aggregate of the stock portion of
the Closing Transaction Bonus Unit Payment corresponding to such Transaction
Bonus Unit Recipients Vested Transaction Bonus Units as soon as practicable
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than the first regular payroll
date that is at least three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date).

 

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent and
any applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold from
any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement or the Distribution and
Liquidation Agreement to any holder or former holder of Common Shares,
Restricted Shares, Options, Transaction Bonus Units or in respect of payments
to a party to a Phantom Share Agreement or Transaction Bonus Unit Recipient
such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or such other
withholding agent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or any applicable withholding agent and
paid over to the proper Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable Tax
Law, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
and the Distribution and Liquidation Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Common Shares, Restricted Shares or Options or the party to a
Phantom Share Agreement or the Transaction Bonus Unit Recipient in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving
Company, the Paying Agent or the applicable withholding agent, as the case may
be. Prior to deducting or withholding any amounts from the Per Share Closing
Merger Consideration otherwise payable with respect to the Common Shares,
Parent or the Surviving Company shall, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Paying Agent to, give reasonable advance notice of any
such anticipated deduction or withholding (together with the legal basis
therefor) to the Shareholder Representative and sufficient opportunity to
provide (or cause to be provided) any applicable certificates or other
documentary evidence or take such other steps in order to avoid or reduce such
withholding or deduction and shall reasonably cooperate with the Shareholder
Representative, in good faith, to reduce any amounts that would otherwise be
deducted and withheld pursuant to this _Section 2.4(g)_; _provided_ that
Parent, the Company and the Paying Agent shall have been timely furnished with
a duly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 in respect of each Shareholder and
any other documents prescribed by applicable Tax Law properly verifying that
the payment is exempt from withholding.

(h)  _Non-Accredited Investors_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, no Parent Common Stock that, but for this _Section 2.4(h)_,
would have become issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, _2.1(b)_ , or 
_2.1(d)(ii)_ or _Section 2.8_ to any Shareholder, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, each holder of unvested Restricted Shares, or Option
Holder may be issued to more than thirty-five (35) persons who are not
Confirmed Accredited Investors unless such shares have been registered on a
registration statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate form. Each such person
who is not a Confirmed Accredited Investor shall have, either alone or with
the Shareholder Representative (in his capacity as "the purchaser
representative" (as defined in Rule 501(i) of Regulation D under the
Securities Act)), such knowledge and experience in business and financial
matters that such person is capable of evaluating the merits of the risks of
the Parent Common Stock. To the extent any Parent Common Stock that has not
been registered would be issuable to more than thirty-five (35) persons who
are not Confirmed Accredited Investors, Parent Common Stock otherwise
issuable to an Option Holder, Phantom Award Holder or Transaction Bonus Unit
Recipient in respect of

 



13

    

 such Option Holders Options, such Phantom Award Holders Phantom Share
Awards or such Transaction Bonus Unit Recipients Transaction Bonus Units may,
in Parents sole discretion, be replaced by an amount of cash in lieu of
Parent Common Stock on the basis described in the following sentence if such
Option Holder, Phantom Award Holder or Transaction Bonus Unit Recipient is not
a Confirmed Accredited Investor. In such case, the amount of cash delivered
in lieu of the Parent Common Stock shall be determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock that would have been issued to such
Option Holder, Phantom Award Holder or Transaction Bonus Unit Recipient by
the Parent Stock VWAP.

2.5 _Closing of Company Register of Members_. At the Effective Time, the
Companys and New Holdcos registers of members shall be closed and no
transfer of Common Shares shall thereafter be made (except, for the avoidance
of doubt, pursuant to the Distribution and Liquidation Agreement).

 

2.6 _Certain Actions in Connection with the Merger_.

 

(a) _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. Any amounts delivered to the Paying
Agent pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ that remain unclaimed by eligible
Shareholders one (1) year after the Closing Date will be returned to the
Surviving Company, and any Shareholder entitled to receive the Per Share
Closing Merger Consideration who has not theretofore received payment of such
consideration in accordance with the Distribution and Liquidation Agreement
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of any Per Share Closing
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Common Shares
held by such holder, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, as a general
creditor and without any interest thereon.

 

(b) _No Liability_. None of the Company, the Surviving Company, Parent, any
Affiliates of the foregoing or any other person shall be liable for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

2.7  _Restricted Securities; Transfer Restrictions_.

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that the Parent Common Stock payable as
part of the Per Share Stock Merger Consideration and the Per Share Earn-Out
Payment pursuant to this Agreement and the Distribution and Liquidation
Agreement will not be registered under the Securities Act or under any state
securities laws and is being offered and sold in reliance upon federal and
state exemptions from registration for transactions not involving any public
offering. Each certificate representing Parent Common Stock (if such shares
are certificated) shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in
substantially the following form:

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED
FOR INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED, OR ANY STATE SECURITIES OR BLUE SKY LAWS. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT
BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN EXEMPTION
THEREFROM UNDER SAID ACT OR LAWS.

 



14

    

(b) In the event that the Parent Common Stock payable as part of the Per Share
Stock Merger Consideration and the Per Share Earn-Out Payment pursuant to
this Agreement and the Distribution and Liquidation Agreement (i) becomes
registered under the Securities Act or (ii) is eligible to be transferred
without restriction in accordance with Rule 144 or another exemption from
registration under the Securities Act, Parent shall issue new certificates or
other instruments representing such shares, which shall not contain the legend
in _Section 2.7(a)_ and shall instruct its transfer agent to make any
necessary notations in the share register book of Parent to reflect the
removal of such legend; _provided_ that such stockholder surrenders to Parent
or its transfer agent the previously issued certificates or other
instruments, if any (or provides an affidavit of loss reasonably satisfactory
to Parent), together, in the case of clause (ii) of this paragraph, with any
customary representation letter or, if such stockholder is not relying on
Rule 144, an opinion of counsel, regarding such persons eligibility to sell
under Rule 144 or such other exemption, in each case, if reasonably requested
by Parent.

 

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that the Parent Common Stock payable to
each Shareholder, including, for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of
unvested Restricted Shares, Option Holder, Transaction Bonus Award Recipient
and Phantom Award Holder as part of the Per Share Stock Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement (and, if applicable, the Distribution and
Liquidation Agreement) is subject to the Transfer Restrictions from the
Closing until the end of the day that is the third anniversary of the Closing
Date.

 

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that two-thirds of the Parent Common
Stock payable to each Shareholder, including, for the avoidance of doubt,
each holder of unvested Restricted Shares, as part of the Per Share Earn-Out
Payment pursuant to this Agreement and the Distribution and Liquidation
Agreement is subject to the Transfer Restrictions from the date of issuance of
such Parent Common stock until (i) the end of the day that is six (6) months
following the date of issuance of such Parent Common Stock with respect to
one-third of such Parent Common Stock and (ii) the end of the day that is
three (3) months following the date of issuance of such Parent Common Stock
with respect to one-third of such Parent Common Stock. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Transfer Restrictions shall not apply to one-third of the Parent
Common Stock paid as part of the Per Share Earn-Out Payment to each
Shareholder, including, for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of unvested
Restricted Shares.

 

(e) The parties authorize Parent to cause its transfer agent for the Parent
Common Stock and the broker used by Parent to administer its equity
compensation programs, if applicable, to, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, decline to transfer, and to note stop transfer
restrictions on the stock register and other records relating to the Parent
Common Stock. The parties further acknowledge that each certificate,
instrument or book entry representing Parent Common Stock shall be notated
with a legend in substantially the form set forth below:

 

THE SALE, PLEDGE, HYPOTHECATION, OR TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED
HEREBY IS SUBJECT TO, AND IN CERTAIN CASES PROHIBITED BY, THE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS OF A CERTAIN MERGER AGREEMENT AND TRANSFER RESTRICTION AGREEMENT BY
AND AMONG THE STOCKHOLDER, THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OTHER HOLDERS OF STOCK
OF THE CORPORATION. COPIES OF SUCH AGREEMENTS MAY BE OBTAINED UPON WRITTEN
REQUEST TO THE SECRETARY OF THE CORPORATION.

 



15

    

Upon termination of the Transfer Restrictions, Parent shall issue new
certificates or other instruments representing such shares, which shall not
contain the legend in this _Section 2.7(e)_ and shall instruct its transfer
agent to make any necessary notations in the share register book of Parent to
reflect the removal of such legend; _provided_ that such stockholder
surrenders to Parent or its transfer agent the previously issued certificates
or other instruments, if any (or provides an affidavit of loss reasonably
satisfactory to Parent).

 

(f) The Company shall notify each Shareholder, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, each holder of unvested Restricted Shares, Option Holder, Transaction
Bonus Award Recipient and Phantom Award Holder of the foregoing restrictions
prior to Closing.

(g) To the extent the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.7_ and the
Transfer Restriction Agreement conflict, the Transfer Restriction Agreement
shall control for any Shareholder, including, for the avoidance of doubt, each
holder of unvested Restricted Shares, Option Holder, Transaction Bonus Award
Recipient and Phantom Award Holder who has executed and delivered a Transfer
Restriction Agreement.

 

(h) The parties acknowledge and agree that any attempted transfer in violation
of this Section 2.7 shall be null and void _ab initio_.

2.8 _Earn-Out Payment_.

 

(a) _Earn-Out Payment_. Following the Closing, on the earlier of (x) a date
within ten (10) Business Days after the date on which the Earn-Out Amount is
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_ and (y) the occurrence of an
Acceleration Event, Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, (i) to (A)
each former Shareholder in respect of each Common Share issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time held by such
Shareholder (excluding any Restricted Share that was unvested immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that, had it remained outstanding after the
Effective Time, would have been forfeited by its terms prior to the end of the
Earn-Out Period), (B) each former holder of Vested Options in respect of each
Common Share previously subject to such Vested Option held by such holder,
(C) each former holder of Vested Phantom Share Awards for each Common Share
subject to such Vested Phantom Share Award held by such holder and (D) each
holder of a Parent Restricted Unit or Adjusted Parent Option that has vested
following the Closing and on or before settlement of the Earn-Out Amount
pursuant to this _Section 2.8(a)_, or subject to the penultimate sentence of
this _Section 2.8(a)_, that may become vested after such settlement,
in respect of each Common Share underlying the Unvested Option or Unvested
Phantom Share Award or each Transaction Bonus Unit, as applicable, to which
such Parent Restricted Unit or Adjusted Parent Option relates (in the case of
clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D), other than a Bad Recipient or a Bad Leaver),
the Per Share Earn-Out Payment and (ii) to participants in the Retention Bonus
Pool, the Retention Bonus Pool Amount, which shall be paid to each participant
(A) 25% (or 0%, in the case of any Retention Bonus Pool participant who is
subject to taxation in Canada as a resident of Canada) in the form of cash
(the " _Retention Bonus Pool Cash_ ") and (B) 75% (or 100%, in the case of any
Retention Bonus Pool participant who is subject to taxation in Canada as a
resident of Canada) of

 



16

    

 which shall be paid in an aggregate number of duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of 75% (or 100%, in the case of any Retention Bonus Pool
Participant who is subject to taxation in Canada as a resident of Canada) of
the participants allocated share of the Retention Bonus Pool Amount _divided
by_ the Parent Stock VWAP (the " _Retention Bonus Pool Shares_ "); _provided_
, that the sum of the aggregate amounts payable to all Retention Bonus Pool
participants pursuant to clauses (A) and (B) shall equal the Retention Bonus
Pool Amount, with the allocation to each participant determined in accordance
with the terms of the Retention Bonus Pool. No Earn-Out Amount shall be
delivered with respect to a Parent Restricted Unit or an Adjusted Parent
Option that is not vested on the date the Earn-Out Amount is otherwise
settled pursuant to this _Section 2.8(a)_ and any Earn-Out Amount that is
not so delivered shall be set aside by Parent and delivered to such holder
promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) days) following the dates, if
any, that such Parent Restricted Unit or Adjusted Parent Option becomes
vested, except that such vesting shall be no more frequently than quarterly (
_provided_ that such quarterly vesting schedule shall not result in a delay of
any installments that would otherwise vest monthly). All shares of Parent
Common Stock received in accordance with the foregoing provisions by former
Shareholders shall be subject to the Transfer Restriction Agreement.

 

(b) _Determination of Earn-Out Payment_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable, but no later than thirty (30) days after the end
of each Fiscal Year, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Shareholder
Representative (A) a statement setting forth a calculation of Variable Profits
for such Fiscal Year, which calculation shall be determined in accordance with
the Determination Principles and (B) in the case of the Fiscal Year ended
December 31, 2022, the calculation of the Earn-Out Amount, if any (such
calculations, collectively, the " _Proposed Earn-Out Calculations_ ");
_provided_ that, if, at the time the Proposed Earn-Out Calculations
would otherwise be due in accordance with the foregoing, there is an
unresolved dispute in connection with _subsection 2.8(d)(iv)_ of _Schedule
2.8_ , the due date for the Proposed Earn-Out Calculations shall be extended
to the date that is thirty (30) days after the final resolution of such
dispute; _provided_ , _further_ , that any portion of the Proposed Earn-Out
Calculations that is not subject to such dispute (if any) shall be paid
without regard to the preceding proviso. Parent shall promptly make available
to the Shareholder Representative supporting materials with respect to the
Proposed Earn-Out Calculations as the Shareholder Representative may
reasonably request and shall discuss the Proposed Earn-Out Calculations in
good faith.

(ii) _Earn-Out Calculations_.

 

(A) If the Shareholder Representative does not give written notice of any
dispute (an " _Earn-Out Dispute Notice_ ") to Parent within thirty (30) days
of receiving the Proposed Earn-Out Calculations, together with reasonably
detailed supporting information, the Proposed Earn-Out Calculations shall be
deemed to set forth the final Variable Profits for the applicable Fiscal Year
and, in the case of the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2022, the Earn-Out
Amount, if any. Prior to the end of such thirty (30) day period, the
Shareholder Representative may accept the applicable Proposed Earn-Out
Calculations by delivering written notice to that effect to Parent, in which
case the Proposed Earn-Out Calculations shall be deemed to set forth final
Variable Profits for the applicable Fiscal Year and,

 



17

    

 in the case of the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2022, the Earn-Out Amount,
if any. Any Earn-Out Dispute Notice shall set forth the Shareholder
Representatives proposed calculations of Variable Profits for the applicable
Fiscal Year and, in the case of the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2022, the
Earn-Out Amount.

 

(B) If the Shareholder Representative delivers an Earn-Out Dispute Notice with
respect to the Proposed Earn-Out Calculations within thirty (30) days of
receiving such Proposed Earn-Out Calculations, Parent and the Shareholder
Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve all such disputes during
the thirty (30) day period commencing on the date Parent receives the Earn-
Out Dispute Notice from the Shareholder Representative. During such thirty
(30) day period, the Shareholder Representative shall promptly make available
to Parent such additional supporting materials with respect to the
Shareholder Representatives proposed calculations as Parent or its
Representatives may reasonably request. If all disputes are resolved during
such thirty (30) day period, Parent shall (if necessary) promptly, and in any
event no more than ten (10) Business Days after such resolution, revise and
redeliver the calculations of Variable Profits and, if applicable, the Earn-
Out Amount that are consistent with the resolution of such dispute, which
calculations shall set forth the final Variable Profits for the applicable
Fiscal Year and, if applicable, the final Earn-Out Amount.

(C) For each of the Fiscal Years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31,
2021, if the Shareholder Representative and Parent do not agree upon a final
resolution with respect to the amount of the Variable Profits within such
thirty (30) day period, then (1) if the Shareholder Representatives proposed
calculation of Variable Profits is greater or less than Parents calculation
of Variable Profits by more than ten percent (10%) of Parents calculation of
Variable Profits, then each of Parent and the Shareholder Representative
shall promptly (and in any event no more than ten (10) Business Days after
referral of the matter to the Earn-Out Accounting Firm) submit in writing on a
confidential basis and without sharing the same with one another their
respective final proposals with respect to Variable Profits for the applicable
Fiscal Year to the Independent Accounting Firm, or if such firm declines to be
retained to resolve the dispute, another nationally recognized, independent
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Shareholder
Representative (in either case, the " _Earn-Out Accounting Firm_ ") and (2) if
the Shareholder Representatives proposed calculation of Variable Profits is
greater or less than Parents calculation of Variable Profits by less than or
equal to ten percent (10%) of Parents calculation of Variable Profits, the
dispute shall be submitted to and resolved by the Earn-Out Accounting Firm
after the end of Earn-Out Period.

(D) For the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2022, if the Shareholder
Representative and Parent do not agree on the Variable Profits for such
Fiscal Year or the Earn-Out Amount or have not agreed on the Variable Profits
for any prior Fiscal Year, then each of Parent and the Shareholder
Representative shall promptly (and in any event no more than ten (10)
Business Days after referral of the matter to the Earn-Out Accounting Firm)
submit in writing on a confidential basis and without sharing the same with
one another their respective final proposals with respect to Variable Profits
for any Fiscal Years in dispute and the Earn-Out Amount to the Earn-Out
Accounting Firm.

 



18

    

(iii) _Dispute Resolution_. Each of Parent, on the one hand, and the
Shareholder Representative, on the other, shall promptly (and in any event no
more than ten (10) Business Days after referral of the matter to the Earn-Out
Accounting Firm) provide to the Earn-Out Accounting Firm in writing on a
confidential basis and without sharing the same with one another their
assertions and details with respect to their proposals with respect to the
components of Variable Profits for any Fiscal Years in dispute and the Earn-
Out Amount. Following submission of same to the Earn-Out Accounting Firm,
neither Parent nor the Shareholder Representative shall be permitted to change
its final proposals with respect to any disputed components of Variable
Profits for the applicable Fiscal Year(s) and the Earn-Out Amount. Promptly
following receipt of both proposals with respect to any disputed components of
Variable Profits for the applicable Fiscal Year(s) and the Earn-Out Amount and
such assertions and details, Parent and the Shareholder Representative
shall direct the Earn-Out Accounting Firm to provide a copy of same to the
other party. The Earn-Out Accounting Firm shall be requested to render a
determination of the dispute within thirty (30) days after referral of the
matter to the Earn-Out Accounting Firm, which determination must be in
writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. Each of
Parent, on the one hand, and the Shareholder Representative, on the other,
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish the Earn-Out
Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and information
pertaining to the dispute as the Earn-Out Accounting Firm may reasonably
request. Copies of any such furnished materials shall be provided to the other
party concurrently with their being provided to the Earn-Out Accounting Firm.
No party shall engage in any _ex parte_ communications with the Earn-Out
Accounting Firm. In resolving the disputed items, the Earn-Out Accounting Firm
(A) shall be bound by the provisions of this _Section 2.8_, the
Determination Principles and the other terms of this Agreement, (B) shall only
accept either Parents or the Shareholder Representatives proposal with
respect to the components of Variable Profits for all Fiscal Years in dispute
( _e.g._ , if Total Revenues for the Fiscal Years ended December 31, 2020 and
December 31, 2022 are in dispute, then the Earn-Out Accounting Firm shall
select the sum of the Total Revenues for each such Fiscal Year proposed by
either Parent or the Shareholder Representative) and (C) shall limit its
decision to the matters in dispute and to only those adjustments to the Earn-
Out Amount that are necessary to give effect to the terms of this Agreement.
Such determination of the Earn-Out Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties, absent manifest error. The applicable Proposed Earn-
Out Calculations shall be revised as appropriate to reflect the resolution of
any dispute with respect thereto pursuant to this _Section 2.8(b)(iii)_ and,
as so revised, such Proposed Earn-Out Calculations shall be deemed to set
forth the final Variable Profits (and components thereof) and, if applicable,
the Earn-Out Amount, if any. All fees and expenses of the Earn-Out Accounting
Firm relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Earn-Out Accounting
Firm hereunder shall be shared equally between Parent and the
Shareholder Representative. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all
other costs and expenses incurred by the parties in connection with resolving
any dispute hereunder before the Earn-Out Accounting Firm shall be borne by
the party incurring such cost and expense.

(c) _Determination Principles_. Variable Profits shall be determined in
accordance with _Exhibit F_ (the " _Determination Principles_ ").

 



19

    

(d) _Post Closing Operation of the Surviving Company; Losses_. The provisions
of  _subsection 2.8(d)_ of _Schedule 2.8_ shall apply following the Closing.

(e) The parties intend that the Merger will be treated as an acquisition by
Parent of all of the assets and liabilities of the Company in exchange for an
installment obligation of Parent, and that each payment to any former
Shareholder (including for the avoidance of doubt any former holder
of Restricted Shares) under such obligation (including the payment of the Per
Share Closing Merger Consideration and the Per Share Earn-Out Payment
described in _Section 2.8(a)(i)(A)_) will be treated as payment for such
former Shareholders Common Shares pursuant to Section 453(h)(1)(A) of the
Code, in each case for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax
purposes. The parties shall report the Merger and any payments pursuant to the
Installment Obligation consistently with such treatment on all applicable Tax
Returns, except as otherwise required by Law.

(f) _Retention Bonus Pool_. Following the Closing Date, the Surviving Company
shall establish a retention bonus pool (the " _Retention Bonus Pool_ ") to
apportion the Retention Bonus Pool Amount to employees of the Surviving
Company and its subsidiaries as determined by the senior management of the
Surviving Company in its reasonable discretion and after good faith
consultation with Parent and subject to such other terms as and conditions as
mutually reasonably agreed by the senior management of the Surviving Company
and Parent; _provided_ that the portion of the Retention Bonus Pool Amount
payable to any participant in the Retention Bonus Pool who becomes a Bad
Leaver shall not be issued to such participant and shall instead
be reallocated as determined by the senior management of the Surviving
Company in its reasonable discretion and after good faith consultation with
Parent.

 

(g) _International Operations_. If (x) after good faith consultation with
Parent, the Surviving Company determines that its business shall incorporate
the distribution of insurance products contemplated by the Business Plan
(excluding underwriting or manufacturing of such products) in any Permitted
Expansion Country and otherwise in compliance with the other terms of 
_subsection 2.8(d)(ii)(A)_ and _(B)_ of _Schedule 2.8_ prior to the end of
the Earn-Out Period or (y) solely with Parents prior written approval, the
Surviving Company determines that its business shall incorporate the
distribution of insurance products in any country other than the United States
or any Permitted Expansion Country prior to the end of the Earn-Out Period,
then Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall seek in good faith
to agree on equitable and appropriate adjustments to the Earn-Out Amount and
the other terms of this _Section 2.8_, including by providing that (i) net
revenues arising from such expanded operations (calculated in accordance with
the Determination Principles and otherwise consistently with the other net
revenues included in Total Revenues) shall be included in Total Revenues and
(ii) any start-up costs incurred by the Surviving Company, but not by Parent,
shall reduce Variable Profits.

(h) _Competing Platforms_. The provisions of _subsection 2.8(h)_ of _Schedule
2.8_ shall apply following the Closing.

(i) _Coordination_.

 

(i) If the Shareholder Representative or (unless he has become a Bad
Recipient) either of the Founders believes in good faith that any action or
omission by

 



20

    

 Parent constitutes a material breach of Parents obligations under any of
clauses (A) through (I) of sub _section 2.8(d)(i) of Schedule 2.8_ , the
Shareholder Representative shall notify Parent in writing of such belief
within thirty (30) days of the Shareholder Representative or applicable
Founder (as the case may be) first becoming aware of such underlying action or
omission. In the event the Shareholder Representative delivers such a notice
within such thirty (30) day period, Parent and the Shareholder Representative
(in its capacity as such and on behalf of the Founders) shall discuss in good
faith the concerns raised by the Shareholder Representative or applicable
Founder (as the case may be). If Parent agrees to (and does) cease such action
or omission or if such discussion otherwise results in a mutually satisfactory
cure, the Shareholder Representative (in its capacity as such and on behalf
of the Founders) shall deliver a written notice to Parent evidencing its
agreement that such action or omission, taking into account such agreement or
cure, does not constitute (and shall be deemed not to have constituted) a
breach of this Agreement. No failure to give the notice referred to in the
first sentence of this paragraph shall relieve Parent of its obligations
hereunder, unless such failure shall have prejudiced Parent (in which case
Parent shall be relieved of its obligations solely with respect to the matter
in respect of which such notice was failed to be given).

(ii) If Parent believes in good faith that any action or omission by the
Surviving Company constitutes a breach of the Surviving Companys obligations
referred to in _subsection 2.8(d)(ii) of Schedule 2.8_ , Parent shall notify
the Shareholder Representative and (other than any such individual who has
become a Bad Recipient) the Founders in writing of such belief within thirty
(30) days of becoming aware of such underlying action or omission. In the
event Parent delivers such a notice within such thirty (30) day period,
Parent and Shareholder Representative and (other than any such individual who
has become a Bad Recipient) the Founders shall discuss in good faith the
concerns raised by Parent. If the Surviving Company agrees to (and does)
cease such action or omission or if such discussion otherwise results in a
mutually satisfactory cure, Parent shall deliver a written notice to the
Shareholder Representative evidencing its agreement that such action
or omission, taking into account such agreement or cure, does not constitute
(and shall be deemed not to have constituted) a breach of this Agreement. No
failure to give the notice referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph
shall relieve the Surviving Company of its obligations hereunder, unless such
failure shall have prejudiced the Surviving Company (in which case the
Surviving Company shall be relieved of its obligations solely with respect to
the matter in respect of which such notice was failed to be given).

(iii) At the Closing, Parent shall designate up to two individuals, who shall
initially be Parents Head of U.S. Businesses (or the reasonable equivalent
thereof) and Chief Financial Officer of U.S. Businesses (or the reasonable
equivalent thereof) (the " _Parent Designees_ ") and the Shareholder
Representative (in its capacity as such and on behalf of the Founders) shall
designate up two individuals, who shall initially be the Founders (the "
_Shareholder Representative Designees_ ") to serve on a committee (the " _Pre-
Clearance Committee_ "). If at any time during the Earn-Out Period, Parent or
the Surviving Company proposes to take any action in respect of the Surviving
Company, the Earn-Out Amount, the Business Plan or, in each case, any matters
related thereto, the

 



21

    

 Parent Designees or the Shareholder Representative Designees, respectively,
may present such proposed action to the Shareholder Representative Designees
or the Parent Designees, respectively, and the members of the Pre-Clearance
Committee shall discuss whether to approve such action. If such action is
unanimously approved by the Pre-Clearance Committee and such action is taken
substantially in accordance with the timing, scope and manner so approved, it
shall be deemed not to breach any provision of this _Section 2.8_. It is
understood and agreed that the failure of the Pre-Clearance Committee to
approve any proposed action shall not, in and of itself, have any effect on
the determination of whether such action constitutes a breach of this
_Section 2.8_. Parent may replace any Parent Designee at any time by written
notice to the Shareholder Representative and the Shareholder Representative
may replace any Shareholder Representative Designee at any time by written
notice to Parent.

(iv) The party proposing to take any action may also elect to cause the
determination of whether the proposed action would constitute a breach of this
Agreement to be submitted to arbitration in accordance with _Section
9.10(b)_; _provided_ that the procedures therefor may be modified by the
electing party to cause such arbitration to be completed on an expedited basis
(including by limiting the number of arbitrators to one and providing for a
decision on written submissions only without a hearing). Parent and
the Shareholder Representative may also mutually agree to an alternative form
of dispute resolution procedure (including expert determination) in lieu of
arbitration to resolve any such matter. The decision of the arbitrator(s) or
such alternative dispute resolution shall be final and binding on each of the
parties.

(j) _Limitations_.

respect to any one or more of the foregoing, including in certain "data
rooms", management presentations or other information provided or made
available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates or their respective

or business plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business
plans). Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf of themselves and their
Affiliates or their respective Representatives, hereby acknowledges and
agrees that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as
well as in such business plans, with which each of Parent and Merger Sub is
familiar, that each of Parent and Merger Sub is taking full responsibility for
making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such
business plans, so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information or business plans), and that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their Affiliates or their respective Representatives will have any claim
against the Company or any other Company Related Party with respect thereto.

non-disclosure agreement on customary terms, in connection with any necessary
business purpose relating to the Shareholders ownership of the shares of the
Company or their, or any of their Affiliates, status as a current or former
officer, director or shareholder of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
including preparation of governmental or regulatory reporting obligations, or
the resolution of any claims made against or incurred by the Shareholders in
respect of periods

 



51

    

 prior to the Closing, for a period of seven (7) years (or such longer period
as may be required by applicable Laws) after the Closing, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company and its subsidiaries to (i) retain the books and
records relating to the Surviving Company and its subsidiaries with respect to
periods prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably consistent with the prior
practice of the Company and its subsidiaries and (ii) upon reasonable advance
notice and, subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information
(it being agreed that Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its
subsidiaries to make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which such Laws apply), Parent and the
Surviving Company shall, and shall cause each of the Surviving Companys
subsidiaries to, afford to the Shareholders and their respective
Representatives, during normal business hours following the Closing Date, and
in a manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the
Surviving Company and its subsidiaries, reasonable access to the Surviving
Companys and each of its subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts and
records, and to their officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives and, during such periods the Surviving Company shall, and
shall cause its subsidiaries to, make available to the Shareholders all
information concerning their businesses, properties and personnel as they may
reasonably request for the purposes described above; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such right shall not (x) apply to information subject to an attorney-
client privilege (it being understood that the parties shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to enable such
information to be furnished or made available to the requesting party or its
Representatives without jeopardizing attorney-client privilege, including by
entering into a customary joint defense agreement or common interest agreement
with the requesting party to the extent such an agreement would preserve the
applicable privilege) or (y) cause the Surviving Company or any of its
subsidiaries to violate any applicable legal or confidentiality obligations
(it being further agreed that the parties will work in good faith to allow for
such disclosure or access in a manner that does not result in the events set
out in clauses (x) and (y)).

(d) At least five (5) Business Days but not more than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent an updated
_Section 3.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule as of the date of
delivery of such schedule that includes the Companys good faith estimate of
such schedule as of immediately prior to the Closing.

5.3 _Efforts; Approvals_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates and subsidiaries to use reasonable best
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed
on such parties or their subsidiaries with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby (including making all legally required filings) and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and
(ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other parties to obtain) as
promptly as practicable any consent, authorization, non-objection, Order or
approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity that is required to
be obtained by them or any of their respective subsidiaries in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and to comply with the terms and
conditions of any such consent, authorization, Order or approval.

 



52

    

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, undertakes and agrees to file as
soon as practicable, but in all cases, (i) within ten (10) Business Days
following the date hereof, a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act
with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the "
_Antitrust Division_ "), with respect to which the parties shall request early
termination of the applicable waiting period, and (ii) within five (5)
Business Days following the date hereof, filings with respect to the
Governmental Approvals set forth on Section 4.4 of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule.

 

(c) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, as applicable, shall (A)
respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests for
additional information or documentation received from any Governmental Entity,
(B) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust
Laws or enter into any agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any
other Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto, (C) defend through litigation (including appealing any adverse
decisions) any claim asserted in any court by any party, excluding any
Governmental Entity, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order in
any suit or proceeding under any Law, which would otherwise have the effect
of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the Outside Date, and (D)
negotiate, commit and effect all steps required in order to avoid or eliminate
impediments under any Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to
enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable following the date of
this Agreement and, in any event, prior to the Outside Date, including sales,
divestitures or dispositions of assets or businesses of Parent or its
subsidiaries (including the Company or the Company Subsidiary) or committing
to take such action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of Parent or its
subsidiaries (including the Company or the Company Subsidiary) (such actions
referred to in clause (D), collectively, " _Antitrust Remedies_ ").
Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section 5.3_ to the contrary, in no event
shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to undertake, or agree to undertake,
any Antitrust Remedies that would result in a material adverse effect on the
Company or on any business line of Parent or any of its subsidiaries as set
forth in Section 5.3(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (any such Antitrust
Remedy, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). At the request of Parent, the Company
shall agree to divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any
action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of the Company or its
subsidiaries, _provided_ , that any such action shall be conditioned upon the
consummation of the Closing and the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent
and Merger Sub shall be solely responsible for and shall pay all filing fees
payable to the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity
in connection with the antitrust, competition or trade regulation matters
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly furnish to the other party
copies of any notices or written communications, and keep the other party
informed of any substantive oral communications, in each case received by such
party or its Affiliates from any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each of Parent and the
Company shall permit counsel to the other party an opportunity to review in
advance, and shall consider in good faith the views of such counsel in
connection with, any

 



53

    

 proposed written communications (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
filings or notices) by such party or its Affiliates to any Governmental
Entity, including the FTC and the Antitrust Division, concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent agrees to provide the
Company and its counsel the opportunity, on reasonable advance notice, to
participate in any substantive meetings or substantive discussions, either in
person or by telephone, between Parent or any of its Affiliates, agents or
advisors, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity, including the FTC and
Antitrust Division, on the other hand, to the extent reasonably practical and
permitted by such Governmental Entity concerning or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) In no event shall the Company or the Company Subsidiary be obligated to
bear any expense or pay any fee or grant any concession in connection with
obtaining any consents, authorizations or approvals required in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limitation of
Parents obligations under _Section 5.3(b)_, neither the Company nor its
subsidiaries shall propose, negotiate or agree to (i) pay any material consent
fees or (ii) undertake any other conditions imposed by any Governmental
Entity, in each case, in consideration for any third party or Governmental
Entity providing any consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or any
exemption by, such third party or Governmental Entity that is required to be
obtained in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, without the
prior written consent of Parent.

(f) Without limiting the parties obligations under this _Section 5.3_, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, to do or
cause to be done and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated hereby, including: (i) the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of any of the parties and (ii) the execution and
delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other actions, as the
other party may reasonably require in order to carry out the intent of this
Agreement.

(g) Each of the Founders shall exercise the drag-along rights that he has
under the Shareholders Agreement to cause each Shareholder (as such term is
defined in the Shareholders Agreement) party thereto to execute and deliver
such instruments (including duly executed and completed Letters of
Transmittal and duly executed counterparts to the Transfer Restriction
Agreement), and take such other actions, as may reasonably be required in
order to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

 

5.4 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

 

(a) The provisions of the constituent documents of the Company and the Company
Subsidiary concerning the elimination of liability and indemnification of
directors or other persons shall not be amended in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any person that is as of the date
hereof or the Effective Time covered under any such elimination of liability
or indemnification provisions. In addition to the foregoing, from and after
the Effective Time for a period of six (6) years, the Surviving Company shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) indemnify and hold harmless
(or cause to be 

 



54

    

 indemnified and held harmless), to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law, each person who is, or at the Closing Date will be, a current
or former director, employee or officer of the Company or the Company
Subsidiary (the " _D andO Indemnitees_") against all Losses arising out of or
pertaining to acts or omissions (or alleged acts or omissions) of the DandO
Indemnitees, or any of them, in their capacities as such. To the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law, the indemnification and related rights
hereunder shall be mandatory rather than permissive, and the Surviving Company
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) promptly
advance expenses in connection with such indemnification to the extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , that any person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by
applicable Laws or the Companys or its applicable subsidiarys
organizational documents, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) The provisions of this _Section 5.4_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each person released or entitled to
indemnification or other benefit hereunder, and each such persons heirs,
representatives, successors and assigns, it being expressly agreed that such
persons shall be third-party beneficiaries of this  _Section 5.4_ and (ii)
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other right to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or
otherwise. The Surviving Company shall not (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company not to) (x) amend the provisions of this _Section 5.4_
in a manner that would adversely affect any such third-party beneficiary
without the prior written consent of such third-party beneficiary or (y)
following the Closing, enter into, or permit any of its Affiliates to enter
into, any merger, consolidation or other transaction unless the obligations
imposed by this _Section 5.4_ are assumed by the surviving or resulting
entity (including by operation of Law).

(c) The Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company
to), from time to time following the Closing, execute and deliver such other
documents and instruments and take such other actions as may be reasonably
requested by any DandO Indemnitee to implement the provisions of this _Section
5.4_.

 

5.5 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that, for a period of twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date (the " _Benefit Protection Period_ "), it shall provide or cause
the Surviving Company to provide to each employee of the Company or the
Company Subsidiary as of the Closing (" _Continuing Employees_ ") (i) base
wages and salaries that are no less than those provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) annual cash incentive
compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than those provided to
such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing that
are otherwise consistent with _subsection 2.8(d)(ii)_ of _Schedule 2.8_ and
(iii) other employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to either those in effect under the Company Plans immediately prior
to the Closing or those offered to similarly situated employees of Parent,
but in all cases excluding equity and equity based and long-term (including
multi-year variable) incentives, retention bonuses, transaction bonuses,
change in control entitlements, non-qualified deferred compensation
arrangements and, unless required by applicable Law, defined benefit pension
or retiree medical benefits. Without limiting the generality of the
immediately preceding sentence, 

 



55

    

 Parent shall provide or cause the Surviving Company to provide to each
Continuing Employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated without
"cause" during the Benefit Protection Period severance benefits equal to the
severance benefits for which such Continuing Employee was eligible as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time taking into account each Continuing
Employees service with the Company and its subsidiaries (and any predecessor
entities to the extent the Company has provided credit for such service) and,
after the Effective Time, Parent and its subsidiaries.

 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, assume and honor
the Company Plans listed on _Section 3.13(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule in accordance with their terms. Parent hereby acknowledges that a
"change in control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company
Plans will occur at the Effective Time.

 

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its subsidiaries
(other than a Company Plan) in which any Continuing Employees become eligible
to participate on or after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent
shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to: (i) waive all pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible
dependents under any New Plans, (ii) with respect to the plan year in which
the Effective Date occurs, provide each such employee and his or her
eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or coinsurance and
deductibles paid prior to becoming eligible to participate in the New Plans
under an analogous Company Plan, to the same extent that such credit was given
under the analogous Company Plan prior to becoming eligible to participate in
the New Plans, in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment,
coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans and
(iii) recognize all service of such employees with the Company and the
Company Subsidiary in any New Plan for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
level of benefits, but not for benefit accrual purposes, to the same extent
that such service was taken into account under the analogous Company Plan
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing service
recognition shall not apply to the extent it would result in duplication of
benefits for the same period of service.

 

(d) The Company shall take such actions as are necessary so that no Option may
be exercised on or following the date that is three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing and shall provide each holder of Options that are or will be
Vested Options on or prior to the Closing with notice of such actions at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to effectiveness of such actions in order to
allow such Option Holder to exercise his or her Vested Options prior to such
effectiveness. Effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, the Company
shall terminate the Company Stock Plan, except to the extent that
Parent provides written notice to the Company no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date that the Company Stock Plan shall not
be terminated. The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the Company
Stock Plan has been so terminated pursuant to resolutions of the board or any
applicable committee thereof. The Company shall provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review resolutions and other documents in respect of
the actions set forth in this  _Section 5.5(d)._

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof (and in any
event prior to the Closing), the Company shall take the actions set forth on
_Section 5.5(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



56

    

(f) Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company
shall grant, contingent on the Closing, Transaction Bonus Units to each of
the Transaction Bonus Unit Recipients, who are listed on _Section 5.5(f)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain signatures to the Transaction Bonus Unit Agreements from all
Transaction Bonus Unit Recipients prior to the Closing. The number of
Transaction Bonus Units to be granted, the vesting schedule applicable to such
Transaction Bonus Units and the Deemed Exercise Price of such Transaction
Bonus Units in respect of each Transaction Bonus Unit Recipient shall be as
set forth on _Section 5.5(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The
Transaction Bonus Units shall be granted pursuant to the award agreement in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit H_.

(g) Nothing contained herein, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to
establish, amend or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit Parents or the Companys
or any of its Affiliates ability to amend, modify or terminate
any particular benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) is
intended to confer upon any current or former employee any right to employment
or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment or (iv) is intended
to confer upon any individual (including employees, retirees or dependents or
beneficiaries of employees or retirees) any right as a third party beneficiary
of this Agreement.

 

5.6 _Tax Matters_.

(a)  _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes incurred in connection with consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by Parent
when due, and Parent will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges.

(b) _Tax Certificates_. The Shareholder Representative shall deliver to
Parent a certification substantially in the form of the sample certification
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B) in respect of New
Holdco, certifying that New Holdco is not a foreign person.

(c) _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Parent, the Company and the
Shareholder Representative shall provide to each other such reasonable
cooperation, documentation and information relating to the Company and its
subsidiaries as any of them may request that is reasonably necessary in filing
any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund or conducting any Tax
Proceeding or other claim or proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation
and information shall include providing copies of all relevant portions of
relevant Tax Returns, together with all relevant portions of relevant
accompanying schedules and relevant work papers, relevant documents relating
to relevant rulings or other relevant determinations by Taxing Authorities and
relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of relevant property
and other relevant information, which the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective subsidiaries, or the Shareholder Representative may possess. For
the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not be required to provide copies of
any consolidated Tax Returns or any other tax documentation or information
that does not relate exclusively to the Company and its

 



57

    

 subsidiaries. The Company, Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall
each make its employees or Representatives reasonably available on a mutually
convenient basis at its cost to provide an explanation of any documents or
information so provided.

(d) _Pre-Closing Tax Period; Certain Covenants_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, all U.S. federal income tax audits, claims or
proceedings of the Company (" _Tax Proceedings_ ") with respect to any taxable
period (or portion thereof) that ends prior to or on the Closing Date (a "
_Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ") shall be controlled by the Shareholder
Representative; _provided_ , that Parent may participate in such Tax
Proceeding, and no such Tax Proceeding that could have an adverse Tax impact
on Parent or any of its subsidiaries shall be settled without the consent of
Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
For the avoidance of doubt, all other Tax Proceedings shall be controlled by
Parent. The Shareholder Representative shall prepare (or cause to be
prepared) all U.S. federal, state and local income Tax Returns for the Company
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Shareholder Representative shall provide
Parent with copies of any such Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Returns that are to
be filed by Parent for Parents review and consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld) not less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing (it
being agreed and understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, the final IRS
Form 1120-S and any Schedules K-1 thereto of the Company (or New Holdco) and
any analogous state or local Tax Return is not required to be filed by Parent
and is not subject to this sentence). The Company (or New Holdco) shall
timely file, or cause to be timely filed, any such Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax
Returns that are due on or before the Closing Date, and Parent shall timely
file, or cause to be timely filed, any such Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax
Returns that are due after the Closing Date. Parent shall furnish to the
Shareholder Representative as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing
Date all information concerning the Company required for the preparation of
income Tax Returns of the holders of Common Shares, including Schedules K-1
(or equivalent information) for such holders, in sufficient detail to enable
each holder to prepare its U.S. federal, state and local income Tax Returns
with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period that includes the Closing Date.
Except with the prior written consent of the Shareholder Representative or as
otherwise required by Law, Parent shall not, and shall not cause or permit any
of its Affiliates (including the Company and its subsidiaries after the
Closing) to (i) make, change or revoke any Tax election (including any entity
classification election pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3)
with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries that has retroactive
effect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date or (ii) amend or cause to be amended any Tax Return of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries for a taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date.

(e) _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(i) For Tax purposes, Parent and the Shareholder Representative agree to (and
agree to cause their respective Affiliates to) allocate the aggregate Per
Share Cash Merger Consideration and any other amounts treated as consideration
for such Tax purposes among the assets deemed sold for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in accordance with applicable Tax Law, including Section 1060 of the
Code, and this _Section 5.6(e)_ (such allocation, the " _Allocation_ ");
_provided_ that the amounts allocated to the intangible assets of the Company
and its subsidiaries shall be consistent with the valuations arrived at by a
"Big 4" accounting firm engaged (and paid for) by Parent for such purposes and
furnished to the Shareholder Representative.

 



58

    

(ii) No later than sixty (60) days after the Closing, the Shareholder
Representative shall deliver to Parent a proposed draft of the Allocation
(the " _Shareholder Representative Draft Allocation_ "). If Parent disagrees
with the Shareholder Representative Draft Allocation, Parent may, within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the Shareholder Representative Draft
Allocation, deliver a notice (the " _Parent s Allocation Notice_") to the
Shareholder Representative to such effect, specifying those items as to which
Parent disagrees and setting forth Parents proposed Allocation. If Parents
Allocation Notice is duly delivered, Parent and the Shareholder Representative
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputes regarding Parents
Allocation Notice and the Shareholder Representative Draft Allocation. If
Parent and the Shareholder Representative are unable to resolve any dispute
regarding such proposed Allocation within thirty (30) days of the Shareholder
Representatives receipt of Parents Allocation Notice, the parties shall
submit the dispute for resolution to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ "), which shall be directed to, within thirty
(30) days after such submission, determine and report to the parties upon
such remaining disputes with respect to the Allocation, and such report shall
be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. The fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by
Parent and the Shareholder Representative. The Allocation as determined
pursuant to this _Section 5.6(e)(ii)_ (the " _Final Allocation_ ") shall be
conclusive and binding on all parties.

 

(iii) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, and the Founders shall
cause New Holdco to, and to cause its Affiliates to (A) prepare and file all
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation and (B) not take
any position inconsistent therewith on any Tax Return, in connection with any
Tax Proceeding or otherwise, in each case, except to the extent otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code or any similar provision of applicable state, local or foreign
Law. If any Governmental Entity disputes the Final Allocation, the party
receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto, and the parties shall cooperate in good faith in responding to such
dispute in order to preserve the effectiveness of the Final Allocation, as
the case may be.

(f) _Certain Deductions_. The parties agree and acknowledge that the Company
or New Holdco, as the case may be, shall be entitled to take any deduction
for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes
attributable to (i) any payment to any service provider of the Company or New
Holdco that occurs, and is attributable to services performed, at or before
the Closing, (ii) any Closing Option Payment made pursuant to Section
2.1(d)(ii)(A), (iii) any Closing Transaction Bonus Unit Payment pursuant to
Section 2.1(d)(iv)(A), and (iv) any Closing Phantom Award Payment in respect
of any Vested Phantom Share Awards made pursuant to Section 2.1(e)(i)(A), and
neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall take any such deduction in
respect of any such payment described in clauses (i) through (iv) of this
_Section 5.6(f)_.

 



59

    

5.7 _Publicity_. Parent and the Company shall (a) develop a joint
communications plan, (b) ensure that all press releases and other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby are consistent
with such joint communications plan and (c) except in respect of any
announcement required by (i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) a request by
a Governmental Entity, (iii) communications that are substantially similar to
communications previously approved pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ or (iv) an
obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange, consult with each other and obtain the advance approval of the other
party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical,
otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby that is not consistent with prior public
disclosures.

 

5.8 _Termination of Related Party Agreements_. The Company and, to the extent
a party thereto, the Founders, shall take such actions as may be necessary to
terminate all Related Party Agreements other than those set forth on _Section
5.8_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which termination shall be effective
as of or prior to the Closing and shall not result in any further obligations
of the Company or its Affiliates from and after the Closing.

5.9 _Exclusivity_.

 

(a) From the date hereof through the Closing or earlier termination of this
Agreement, the Company and the Founders shall not, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates not to, and shall instruct and cause their respective
Affiliates to instruct their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit, initiate, facilitate, continue, encourage, enter into or
participate in any discussions or negotiations or communications with, or
provide any information to, or enter into any agreement, understanding,
commitment or letter of intent with, any person or group of persons (other
than Parent and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives regarding
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) concerning any change of
control transaction, consolidation, merger, business combination, purchase or
disposition of share capital or other equity interest in the Company or its
subsidiaries, or sale of any substantial portion of the assets of the Company
or its subsidiaries, in each case however structured, other than pursuant to
this Agreement.

 

(b) The Company and the Founders shall and shall cause their respective
Affiliates and Representatives to (i) immediately cease any discussions or
negotiations of the nature described in _Section 5.9(a)_, if any, and (ii) as
soon as practicable following the date hereof request in writing that all
prospective purchasers of the Company to whom nonpublic
information concerning the Company has been distributed on or prior to the
date hereof in connection with the current process relating to the sale of the
Company (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives
acting on their respective behalf) return such information to the Company (or
destroy such information) in accordance with the terms of the confidentiality
agreements between the Company and such prospective purchasers.

 

5.10 _Electronic Data Room_. At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a complete and correct electronic copy of the virtual data
site titled "Rain" established by the Company and maintained at

on the date hereof.

 



60

    

5.11 _Pre-Closing Restructuring_. The Company and the Founders shall
consummate the Pre-Closing Restructuring prior to the Closing in accordance

61

    

 similar import as set forth therein) as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date as though made on and as of such date (except with respect to
representations and warranties that address matters only as of a particular
date, which need only be true and correct as of such date), except to the
extent that the failure to be true and correct has not had or would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

this _Section 6.2(e)_, no effect, event, change, development, occurrence or
circumstance shall, to the extent it was specifically disclosed
or specifically described in the Company Disclosure Schedule, contribute to
the finding of or constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect).

 

(f) _Key Employees_. Each Key Employee identified on Section 6.2(g)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules shall not have revoked or terminated his or her
applicable Employment Agreement, Restrictive Covenant Agreement and
Liquidation Proceeds Agreement and shall not have terminated his or her
employment with the Company (excluding for such purpose if such agreements,
other than the agreements of the Founders, are revoked or terminated or such
persons, other than a Founders, employment is terminated prior to the
Closing as a result of death or disability).

 

(g) _Pre-Closing Restructuring_. The Pre-Closing Restructuring shall have been
consummated in accordance with the steps set forth in Schedule 5.11.

62

    

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall have performed or complied with, in all material respects,
the obligations required to be performed or complied with by it under this
Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date.

Company may rely on the failure of any condition to its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in _Section 6.1_,
_Section 6.2_ or _Section 6.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if a
material cause of such failure was the failure of such party to perform or
comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

 

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent if there shall have been enacted any Law
or if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a
final, non-appealable Order or taken any other action, in each case after the
date hereof and in each case permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby;

 

(c) by either the Company or Parent if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have been consummated on or before the later of (i) the
one hundred fiftieth (150th) day following the date hereof and (ii) if any
party hereto brings any claim, action or proceeding for injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief as provided in _Section 9.9_, prior to
the date referenced in clause (i) above and against any other party hereto,
the date that is five (5) Business Days after the date on which such claim,
action or proceeding has been finally resolved pursuant to a non-appealable
order, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction (the " _Outside
Date_ "); _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this 
_Section 7.1(c)_ shall not be available to or on behalf of any party whose
action or failure to act has been a material cause of or resulted in the
failure of the Closing to be consummated on or prior to such date; and

 

(d) by either the Company or Parent if there shall have been a breach by
Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations contained in
this Agreement, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy one or
more of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ (in the case of a breach
by the Company) or _Section 6.3_ (in the case of a breach by Parent or
Merger Sub), and in any such case such breach shall be incapable of being
cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured prior to the
earlier of (i) thirty (30) days after providing written notice of such breach
to the breaching party and (ii) the Outside Date.

 



63

    

Any proper termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ shall
be effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the
terminating party to the other parties.

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 7.1_, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or
obligation on the part of any party hereto or its respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, shareholders, partners, members or other
Representatives, other than pursuant to the provisions of _Section 5.2(b)_
(Confidentiality), _Section 5.7_ (Publicity), this _Section 7.2_ (Effect of
Termination) and _Article IX_ (General Provisions) (which Sections and
Articles shall survive any termination of this Agreement); _provided_ , that
no such termination of this Agreement shall relieve or otherwise affect the
liability of any party hereto for any willful and intentional breach of this
Agreement by such party prior to such termination. For purposes hereof, a
"willful and intentional breach" shall mean a material breach of any material
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement set forth in this
Agreement that is a consequence of an act undertaken or failure to act by the
breaching party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act or
failure to act would cause a breach of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII

 

INDEMNIFICATION

8.1  _Survival of Covenants_.

(a) The covenants, agreements and obligations contained in this Agreement
required to be performed or complied with prior to the Closing shall survive
the Closing until the date on which the Buyers Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year in which the Closing occurs is required to be filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, and all other covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement shall survive in accordance with their respective
terms (or until the applicable statute of limitations has expired, if no term
for performance is specified).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any breach of
any covenant, agreement or obligation contained in this Agreement or any
matter set forth on _Schedule 8.2_ or _Schedule 8.2A_ in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at which
it would otherwise terminate pursuant to this _Section 8.1_,  _Schedule 8.2_
or _Schedule 8.2A_ , as applicable, if written notice of a claim hereunder
with respect thereto shall have been given by the Parent Indemnified Party to
the Founders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to such
time.

8.2 _Indemnification of Parent_. From and after the Closing Date, the Founders
shall severally and not jointly (and not jointly and severally), in
proportion to their relative ownership of Voting Common Stock as of
immediately prior to the Closing, indemnify and hold harmless Parent, Merger
Sub, its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Company
and its

 



64

    

 subsidiaries) and their respective successors (collectively, the " _Parent
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against Losses incurred by any Parent
Indemnified Party that result from (a) any Founder intentionally taking any
action, or intentionally failing to take any action, that causes a breach of
any covenant, agreement or obligation required to be performed pursuant to
this Agreement by the Company prior to the Closing (and if only one Founder
meets the foregoing standard only such Founder shall be liable hereunder with
respect to the applicable claim but such Founder, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall be liable for 100% of the applicable Losses, subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Article VIII_ ) or (b) the matters set forth on _Schedule
8.2_ or _Schedule 8.2A_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Indemnified
Parties rights to assert claims for Losses pursuant to this _Section 8.2_
shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_ (except,
to the extent applicable, as provided in _Schedule 8.2_ or _Schedule 8.2A_ ).
The Founders in their sole discretion may elect to satisfy any
indemnification obligation under this _Section 8.2_ by forfeiting shares of
Parent Common Stock then held by the Founders having an aggregate value equal
to the amount of such indemnification obligation, with such shares valued at
the greater of (i) the Parent Stock VWAP and (ii) the average of the daily
volume weighted average price per share of Parent Common Stock on the New York
Stock Exchange (or on the principal exchange on which the shares of Parent
Common Stock are then traded) for the thirty (30) consecutive days on which
the New York Stock Exchange (or such other exchange) is open for trading
ending on the last such day immediately prior to the date of such
forfeiture. 

8.3 _Limitations_.

 

(a) Subject to the additional limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_ ,
the Founders shall not be liable to the Parent Indemnified Parties for
indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)_ (i) unless and until the Parent
Indemnified Parties have incurred Losses with respect to any individual claim
or series of related claims in excess of $100,000 (the " _De Minimis
Threshold_ "), in which case the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to seek recovery for all Losses from the first dollar; _provided_ that, once
recovery pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ has reached $500,000 in the aggregate,
the De Minimis Threshold shall no longer apply. Subject to the additional
limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_ , the Founders shall be liable to
the Parent Indemnified Parties for indemnification under  _Section 8.2(b)_
only as provided in _Schedule 8.2_ or _Schedule 8.2A_ , as applicable.

(b) Except as provided in  _Schedule 8.2_ or _Schedule 8.2A_ , as applicable,
the maximum aggregate liability of the Founders under this _Article VIII_ for
Losses indemnified under _Section 8.2_ shall not exceed $117,500,000 in the
aggregate for both Founders taken together (the " _Cap_ ").

(c) For purposes of this _Article VIII_ , the Founders shall not be liable
for (i) punitive or exemplary damages or (ii) any other damages to the extent
such damages are not reasonably foreseeable; provided that the foregoing
provision of this _Section 8.3(c)_ shall not limit any Parent
Indemnified Partys ability to recover any such losses actually paid to any
unaffiliated third party in connection with a claim by an unaffiliated third
party.

 

8.4 _Direct Claims_. In the event any Parent Indemnified Party has a claim for
indemnity under _Section 8.2_ against the Founders that does not involve a
Third-Party Claim, such Parent Indemnified Party shall provide prompt written
notice of such claim to the Founders.

 



65

    

 Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis
for and anticipated amount of indemnification. The failure to so notify the
Founders shall not relieve the Founders of their obligations hereunder,
except to the extent such failure shall have prejudiced the Founders.

8.5 _Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) In the event any Parent Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under
_Section 8.2_, it shall provide prompt written notice to the Founders of the
assertion of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding
by any third-party (" _Third-Party Claim_ ") in respect of which indemnity may
be sought hereunder. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such
Third-Party Claim and the basis for and anticipated amount of indemnification.
The failure to so notify the Founders shall not relieve the Founders of their
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall
have prejudiced the Founders.

(b) Subject to the limitations below and except as provided in _Schedule 8.2_
or _Schedule 8.2A_ , the Founders shall be entitled to control and select
counsel (which counsel shall not be unreasonably objected to by Parent) for
such defense by delivering written notice within thirty (30) calendar days
after receiving the Parent Indemnified Partys notice of claim to such Parent
Indemnified Party of their intent to do so. If the Founders do not so elect to
defend such Third-Party Claim or fail to diligently prosecute the defense of
such Third-Party Claim, the Parent Indemnified Party shall have the right to
control and select counsel (which counsel shall not be unreasonably objected
to by the Founders) for such defense and, subject to the limitations in this
_Article VIII_ , seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon or
arising from such Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
understood and agreed that (i) Parent shall control and select counsel (which
counsel shall not be unreasonably objected to by the Founders) in respect
of the matter set forth in Section 2 of _Schedule 8.2_ , and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred by any
Parent Indemnified Party shall be Losses and subject to indemnity to the
extent provided therein and (ii) Parent shall control and select counsel
(which counsel shall not be unreasonably objected to by the Founders) in
respect of the matters set forth in _Schedule 8.2A_ as provided in _Schedule
8.2A_ and the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred by any Parent
Indemnified Party shall be Losses and subject to indemnity to the extent
provided therein.

(c) If the Founders assume the control of the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, (i) the Founders shall obtain the prior written consent of the Parent
Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of such Third-Party
Claim, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, if the settlement does not release each applicable Parent
Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Third-Party Claim, the settlement admits culpability on the part of any
Parent Indemnified Party or the settlement imposes injunctive or other
equitable relief against a Parent Indemnified Party or would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the ongoing business or operations of the Parent
Indemnified Parties in any material respect and (ii) the Parent Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of any
Third-Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such
purpose, _provided_ , that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel
shall be paid by the Parent Indemnified Party, except as provided below. The
Parent Indemnified Party and the Founders shall reasonably cooperate, and the
Parent 

 



66

    

 Indemnified Party shall cause its Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, in the
defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to
be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may
reasonably be requested in connection therewith. Notwithstanding an election
by the Founders to assume the defense of such action or proceeding, the
Parent Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and
to participate in, but not control, the defense of such action or proceeding.
The Founders shall (subject to the other limitations herein) bear the
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of one (1) firm of such separate counsel
(in addition to one firm of local counsel for the requisite jurisdiction(s))
for the Parent Indemnified Parties if, but only if, (i) the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall have been advised by counsel that an actual or potential
conflict of interest makes representation by the same counsel or the counsel
selected by the Founders inappropriate or (ii) the Founders shall have
authorized in writing the Parent Indemnified Parties to employ such counsel
at the Founders expense. No Founder shall be liable to indemnify any Parent
Indemnified Party for any settlement of any Third-Party Claim effected without
its consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(d) If any payment is made on a Third-Party Claim, the Founders shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the
Parent Indemnified Parties to any insurance benefits or other claims of the
Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to such Third-Party Claim and shall be
entitled to pursue recovery against the applicable insurers or other persons
in respect of such benefits or other claims.

8.6 _Character of Indemnity Payments_. The parties agree that any
indemnification payments made with respect to this Agreement shall be treated
as an adjustment to the purchase price for all applicable Tax purposes, except
as otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

8.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to _Section 9.9_, Parent acknowledges and
agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, its sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any and all claims for any breach of any covenant, agreement
or obligation set forth in or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this _Article VIII_ ; _provided_ that the foregoing provision shall not apply
to any claim involving any covenant, agreement or obligation set forth in
_Section 2.8_ (including any directly related definitions, Schedules or
Exhibits) or otherwise relating to the subject matter thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing shall not
limit any of Parents rights or remedies in the case of Fraud (it being agreed
that each Founder shall only be responsible for its own respective Fraud and
for fifty percent (50%) of any losses or damages resulting from any Fraud by
the individuals listed in _Section 9.1(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule).

 

8.8 _Calculation of Losses_. The amount of any claims for Losses subject to
indemnification by the Founders under this _Article VIII_ shall be calculated
net of any amounts recovered by the Parent Indemnified Parties under any
third-party indemnities or insurance policies (less the documented out-of-
pocket amount of the expenses payable to third parties reasonably incurred by
the Parent Indemnified Parties in procuring such recovery, including the
present value of any reasonably determined prospective increase in insurance
premiums), and, with respect to claims for Losses subject to indemnification
by the Founders under _Section 8.2(a)_ only, Parent shall make or cause to
be made all commercially reasonable claims for indemnification or insurance
under such third-party indemnification provisions or insurance policies that
may be applicable to the matter giving rise to the indemnification claim
hereunder.

 



67

    

8.9 _Mitigation_. The Parent Indemnified Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate Losses hereunder after the date on which such
Parent Indemnified Party becomes aware of an event, occurrence or action and
that such event, occurrence or action would reasonably be expected to give
rise to Losses recoverable under this _Article VIII_.

8.10 _Offset_. Any payment finally determined (time for appeal having expired)
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be due from a Founder to a Parent
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article VIII_ that remains outstanding
prior to the delivery of the Earn-Out Amount pursuant to _Section 2.8_ may,
in such Parent Indemnified Partys discretion, be satisfied in whole or in
part, by offsetting such amount against the portion of the Earn-Out Amount
payable to such Founder. The right to offset such amounts shall be in addition
to other rights and remedies which the Parent Indemnified Party may have to
recover such payment.

ARTICLE IX

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

9.1  _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_.

(a) None of the representations and warranties of any party hereto contained
in this Agreement or any of the other documents contemplated hereby

any party hereto required to be performed by such party before the Closing
shall survive the Closing and unless otherwise indicated, the covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement which by their terms are required to be
performed after the Closing shall survive the Closing until they have been
performed and satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
nothing herein shall be deemed to apply to, or limit in any way, any partys
rights and remedies in the case of Fraud (it being agreed that each Founder
shall only be responsible for its own respective Fraud and for fifty percent
(50%) of any losses or damages resulting from any Fraud by the individuals
listed in _Section 9.1(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule).

(b) Effective upon the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, except with respect to (i) claims for Fraud (it being agreed that each

percent (50%) of any losses or damages resulting from any Fraud by the
individuals listed in Section 9.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule),
(ii) claims under this Agreement, the Employment Agreements, Restrictive
Covenant Agreements and any other Contracts executed in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) claims arising under or in

not disclosed in _Section 3.19_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (iv) any
matter solely between a Company Related Party and any of its employees with
respect to matters arising in connection with the management or operation of
the businesses of the Company Related Parties that is unrelated to the

68

    

 ordinary course of business between a Releaser and a Company Related Party
that is unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
ownership or operation of the Company and its subsidiaries, each of Parent,
the Surviving Company and their subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Releasers_
") hereby knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly waives, acquits,
remises, discharges and forever releases each Company Related Party from any
and all liabilities and obligations to such Releasers arising out of the
organization, management or operation of the business of the Company of any
kind or nature whatsoever arising as of or prior to the Closing and, except
to the extent contemplated by _Article VIII_ , _Section 9.1(a)_ or _Section
9.9_, relating to this Agreement (or any certificate delivered in connection
herewith) or the transactions contemplated hereby or his, her or its
ownership interest in the Company, in each case whether absolute or
contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown, matured or unmatured
or determined or determinable, and whether arising under any Law or Contract
or otherwise at law or in equity, and each of the Releasers hereby agrees
that it will not seek to recover any amounts in connection therewith or
thereunder from any Company Related Party.

 

9.2 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented by
the parties hereto at any time solely by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto. The approval of the Merger by the
Shareholders shall not restrict the ability of the board of directors of the
Company to cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with 
_Section 7.1_, to cause the Company to enter into an amendment to this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ or to the extent permitted under the
WBCA or WLLCA (as applicable) or to waive compliance with any of the terms
or conditions of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.3_.

9.3 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, as applicable, the
parties hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) to the extent
permitted by Law, waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement by any other party or in any
document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by any other
applicable party or (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements
or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if expressly set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

9.4 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed
given (a) when received if delivered personally, (b) on the next Business Day
if sent by overnight courier for next Business Day delivery (providing proof

9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties. The exchange of a fully
executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by
electronic delivery in _.pdf_ format shall be sufficient to bind the parties
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

9.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, which the parties hereto agree shall terminate and
be of no further force and effect as of the Closing, this Agreement and the
documents and instruments referred to herein constitute the entire agreement
between the parties, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any person other than
the parties hereto any rights or remedies except (a) as provided in _Section
5.4_ (Directors and Officers Indemnification) and (b) that the Shareholders
and their Affiliates shall be third-party beneficiaries of _Article II_ ,
_Section 4.13_ (Non-Reliance), _Section 7.2_ (Effect of Termination) and
this _Article IX_ (General Provisions). For the avoidance of doubt, the
Shareholder Representative and the Shareholders shall have the right to
enforce _Article II_.

 

9.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware regardless of
the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict
of laws thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Merger shall be governed by
and subject to the terms and provisions of the WBCA or WLLCA, as applicable.

9.8 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned (in whole or in
part) by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other parties and any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void and of no effect, except that
Parent may assign its rights hereunder to a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
(for so long as such Subsidiary remains wholly owned, and which assignment
shall not release Parent from its obligations hereunder). No assignment by any
party shall relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject
to the preceding sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall
inure to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

 



72

    

9.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached and that any breach of this Agreement would not be adequately
compensated by monetary damages. Accordingly, the parties shall be entitled
to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement, including an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including
the parties obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties
hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance
that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law
to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

9.10 _Jurisdiction_.

(a) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect
of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than disputes arising after the Closing, which
shall be subject to  _Section 9.10(b)_ exclusively) exclusively in any
federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the State of
Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and, solely in connection with claims
arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this
Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen
Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or
proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen
Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party
and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or
proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section
9.4_.

(b) _Dispute Resolution_. The following provisions shall apply solely with
respect to any dispute arising after the Closing:



     | (i) |

Any dispute, controversy or claim arising from, relating to, or in connection
with this Agreement or the Parent Credit Facility, including with respect to
the formation, applicability, breach, termination, validity or enforceability
thereof, or the transactions contemplated thereby, shall be resolved by
arbitration. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

Notwithstanding _Section 9.7_, the arbitration and the arbitration agreement
set forth in this  _Section 9.10(b)_ shall be governed by Title 9
(Arbitration) of the United States Code. The arbitration shall be administered
by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration
Rules, except as they may be modified herein. No expedited procedures shall
apply unless mutually agreed in writing by the parties to the arbitration. The
arbitration shall be seated in New York, New York. 

---|---|--- 
 



73

         | (iii) |

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties to the arbitration, the arbitration
shall be conducted by three arbitrators. Each arbitrator shall be a former
judge of the chancery or appellate courts of the State of Delaware. 

---|---|--- 



     | (iv) |

If more than one arbitration is begun under this Agreement or the Parent
Credit Facility and any party contends that two or more arbitrations are
substantially related and that the issues should be heard in one proceeding,
the arbitrator(s) selected in the first-filed of such proceedings shall
determine whether, in the interests of justice and efficiency,
the proceedings should be consolidated before those arbitrator(s). 

---|---|--- 



     | (v) |

Any decision or award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding
on each of the parties, and judgment upon such decision or award may be
entered by any court having jurisdiction of the award or having jurisdiction
over the relevant party or its assets. The parties agree that any ruling by
the arbitrator(s) on interim measures shall be deemed to be a final award
with respect to the subject matter of the ruling and shall be fully
enforceable as such. 

---|---|--- 



     | (vi) |

A request by a party to a court of competent jurisdiction for interim measures
necessary to preserve the parties rights, including pre-arbitration
injunctions or attachments, shall not be deemed incompatible with, or a waiver
of, this agreement to arbitrate. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (vii) |

The parties agree that any arbitration hereunder shall be kept confidential.
The existence of the arbitration, any non-public information provided in the
arbitration, and any submissions, orders or awards made in the arbitration,
shall not be disclosed to any non-party except the arbitrator(s), the American
Arbitration Association, the parties, their counsel, experts, witnesses,
accountants and auditors, insurers and reinsurers, and any other person
necessary to the conduct of the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
party may disclose such information to the extent that disclosure may be
required to fulfill a legal duty, protect or pursue a legal right, or enforce
or challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings. This confidentiality
provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and of any arbitration
brought pursuant to this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that disputes related to the
calculation of the Earn-Out Amount (but not disputes relating to the
interpretation of legal (rather than financial) terms) shall be exclusively
resolved by the Earn-Out Accounting Firm in accordance with the dispute
resolution procedures expressly contemplated by  _Section 2.8(b)_.

9.11 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A

 



74

    

 TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) EACH PARTY HERETO UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER; (c) EACH PARTY HERETO MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) EACH PARTY HERETO HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 9.11_.

9.12  _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and
this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction
as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any
provision had never been contained herein, so long as the economic and
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in a
manner materially adverse to any party hereto.

9.13 _Disclosure Schedules_. All capitalized terms not defined in the
Disclosure Schedules shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this
Agreement. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Founders and the Company set forth in this Agreement are made and given
subject to, and are qualified by, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub
set forth in this Agreement are made and given subject to, and are qualified
by, the Parent Disclosure Schedule. Any disclosure set forth in one section or
subsection of either Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to and
qualify the section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in
number and each other section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such information is relevant
to such other section or subsection. The Disclosure Schedules may include
brief descriptions or summaries of certain agreements and instruments. The
descriptions or summaries do not purport to be comprehensive and are qualified
in their entirety by reference to the text of the documents described. No
disclosure set forth in the Disclosure Schedules relating to any possible
breach or violation of any Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission
or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred. The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedules shall
not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment that such information (a)
is required by the terms of this Agreement to be disclosed, (b) is material to
the Company, the Company Subsidiary, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, or
any other party, (c) has resulted in or would result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable or (d) is

Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to
be reflected in the Disclosure Schedules. Such additional matters are set
forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters
of a similar nature.

 



75

    

9.14 _Legal Representation_. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, partners, officers,
employees and Affiliates, that Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz may serve as
counsel to each and any Shareholder and its Affiliates (individually and
collectively, the " _Shareholder Group_ "), on the one hand, and the Company
and the Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz (or any successor) may serve as counsel to each
and any member of the Shareholder Group or any director, partner, officer,
employee or Affiliate of any member of the Shareholder Group, in connection
with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding
such representation and each of the parties hereto (including, but not limited
to, the Surviving Company) hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of
interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties shall cause
any controlled Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest
arising from such representation. Parent and Merger Sub agree that, as to all
communications prior to the Closing among Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, the
Company and the Company Subsidiary, the Shareholders and their respective
Affiliates that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to the Shareholders and their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, and may be controlled by the Shareholders and their respective
Affiliates and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Company or the Company Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Company or the Company Subsidiary and a third party other than a party to this
Agreement after the Closing, the Surviving Company may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Surviving Company may not have access to such confidential
communications or waive such privilege without the prior written consent of
the holders of a majority of the Shareholder Group. This _Section 9.14_ is
for the benefit of the Shareholder Group and such persons are intended third-
party beneficiaries of this _Section 9.14_.

9.15 _Expenses_. Except as may be otherwise provided herein, whether or not
the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs or expenses, including
for the avoidance of doubt, the Company, with respect to the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

9.16 _Shareholder Representative_.

 

(a) By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement, and without any further
action of any of the Shareholders, including, for the avoidance of doubt,
each holder of unvested Restricted Shares, Option Holders, Transaction Bonus
Unit Recipients, Phantom Award Holders or the Company, Gulliver Swenson is
hereby irrevocably nominated, constituted and appointed as the exclusive
representative, agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact of each of the
Shareholders, Option Holders, Transaction Bonus Unit Recipients and Phantom
Award Holders (the " _Shareholder Representative_ "), with full power of
substitution by the Shareholders or,

 



76

    

 following the Closing, by the Founders (and, if so substituted, the
Shareholder Representative and/or the Founders will promptly notify Parent of
such substitution) to act in the name, place and stead of the Shareholders,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of unvested Restricted
Shares, Option Holders, Transaction Bonus Unit Recipients and Phantom Award
Holders with respect to this Agreement, as the same may be from time to time
amended, and with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby; to act as
"purchaser representative" (as defined in Rule 501(i) of Regulation D under
the Securities Act) for any Shareholder, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, each holder of unvested Restricted Shares, Option Holder, Transaction
Bonus Unit Recipient or Phantom Award Holder that is not an Accredited
Investor; and to do or refrain from doing all such acts and things, and to
execute all such documents (including any amendments to this Agreement and
any requests, notices, waivers and consents), in each case as the Shareholder
Representative shall deem necessary, appropriate or desirable in connection
with this Agreement, any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; and to enforce and protect
(or refrain from enforcing) the rights and interests of the Shareholders,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of unvested Restricted
Shares, Option Holders, Transaction Bonus Unit Recipients and Phantom Award
Holders (including by asserting or defending any claim, consenting to,
compromising or settling any such claim or conducting any negotiation
regarding any such claim) arising out of or under or in any manner relating
to this Agreement, any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

(b) All decisions, actions (or failures to take an action or omissions of an
action), notices, instructions and communications of the Shareholder
Representative shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Shareholders,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of unvested Restricted
Shares, Option Holders, Transaction Bonus Unit Recipients and Phantom Award
Holders and may be relied upon by Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates as
the decisions, actions (or failures to take an action or omissions of an
action), notices, instructions and communications of the Shareholders,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of unvested Restricted
Shares, Option Holders, Transaction Bonus Unit Recipients and Phantom Award
Holders. The Shareholder Representative and each Shareholder, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, each holder of unvested Restricted Shares, Option
Holder, Transaction Bonus Unit Recipient and Phantom Award Holder shall be
entitled to disregard any notices or communications given or made by any
Shareholder, including, for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of unvested
Restricted Shares, Option Holder, Transaction Bonus Unit Recipient and
Phantom Award Holder not given or made through the Shareholder Representative.
The Shareholder Representative shall not be liable to any of the Shareholders,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of unvested Restricted
Shares, Option Holders, Transaction Bonus Unit Recipients and Phantom Award
Holders for any act done or omitted by the Shareholder Representative in good
faith pursuant to this Agreement or any agreement ancillary hereto or any
mistake of fact or Law unless caused by the Shareholder Representatives
knowing and material willful misconduct in the performance of its duties under
this Agreement. The Shareholders, including, for the avoidance of doubt, each
holder of unvested Restricted Shares, Option Holders, Transaction Bonus Unit
Recipients and Phantom Award Holders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Shareholder Representative from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees,
costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and
their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising

 



77

    

 out of or in connection with the Shareholder Representatives execution and
performance of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each
case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that
in the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have
been directly caused by the knowing and material willful misconduct of the
Shareholder Representative, the Shareholder Representative will reimburse the
Shareholders, including, for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of unvested
Restricted Shares, Option Holders, Transaction Bonus Unit Recipients and
Phantom Award Holders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to
the extent attributable to such knowing and material willful misconduct. If
not paid directly to the Shareholder Representative by the Shareholders,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of unvested
Restricted Shares, Option Holders, Transaction Bonus Unit Recipients and
Phantom Award Holders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the
Shareholder Representative from the Shareholder Representative Expense Amount;
_provided_ , that while this _Section 9.16(b)_ allows the Shareholder
Representative to be paid from the aforementioned source, this does not
relieve the Shareholders, including, for the avoidance of doubt, each holder
of unvested Restricted Shares, Option Holders, Transaction Bonus Unit
Recipients and Phantom Award Holders from their obligation to promptly pay
such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Shareholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to
it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Shareholder Representative be
required to advance any of his own funds on behalf of the Shareholders,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of unvested Restricted
Shares, Option Holders, Transaction Bonus Unit Recipients and Phantom Award
Holders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification
obligations of the Shareholders, including, for the avoidance of doubt, each
holder of unvested Restricted Shares, Option Holders, Transaction Bonus Unit
Recipients and Phantom Award Holders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are
not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Shareholder
Representative under this _Section 9.16_. The foregoing indemnities will
survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the Shareholder
Representative or the termination of this Agreement. In taking any action or
refraining from taking any action whatsoever the Shareholder Representative
shall be protected in relying upon any notice, paper or other document
reasonably believed by it to be genuine, or upon any evidence reasonably
deemed by it to be sufficient. The Shareholder Representative may consult
with counsel in connection with its duties and shall be fully protected in any
act taken, suffered or permitted by it in good faith in accordance with the
advice of counsel. Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates shall
not be liable in any manner whatsoever for any action taken or not taken in
reliance upon the actions taken or not taken or communications or writings
given or executed by the Shareholder Representative.

 

(c) The Shareholders, including, for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of
unvested Restricted Shares, Option Holders, Transaction Bonus Unit Recipients
and Phantom Award Holders will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Shareholder Representative Expense Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign
to the Shareholder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise
have had in any such interest or earnings. The Shareholder Representative
will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Shareholder Representative
Expense Amount other than as a result of its knowing and material willful
misconduct. The Shareholder Representative will hold these funds separate
from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses
or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The

 



78

    

 Shareholder Representative Expense Amount shall be retained by the
Shareholder Representative for such time as the Shareholder Representative
shall determine in his sole discretion. Any amounts from the Shareholder
Representative Expense Amount that remain unused through the date determined
by the Shareholder Representative pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
distributed to the Shareholders in accordance with their ownership interests
in the Company and entitlement to consideration in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. For tax purposes, the Shareholder Representative Expense
Amount will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by
the Shareholders, including, for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of
unvested Restricted Shares, Option Holders, Transaction Bonus Unit Recipients
and Phantom Award Holders at the time of Closing.

 

(d) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Shareholder, including, for the avoidance of doubt, each
holder of unvested Restricted Shares, Option Holder, Transaction Bonus Unit
Recipient and Phantom Award Holder and (ii) shall survive the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) Any Action against Parent or any of its subsidiaries that is brought by or
on behalf of a Shareholder, including, for the avoidance of doubt, each
holder of unvested Restricted Shares, Option Holder, Transaction Bonus Unit
Recipient or Phantom Award Holder, either individually or as a group, with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
may be brought only by the Shareholder Representative and/or either Founder.
