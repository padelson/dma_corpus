(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 3.2_ to the contrary,
the Cash Portion and the Stock Portion that would be payable to the
Blocker Corp if the Blocker Corp were participating in the Merger (rather
than the sale of common stock of the Blocker Corp pursuant to the Blocker

(a) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 6.7_ to the contrary,

books, records and systems solely to audit, during normal business hours
following at least two (2) Business Days' advanced written notice (the "
_Completed Order Audit_ ") the number of Measurement Period Completed Orders
(the " _Audited Measurement Period Completed Orders_ ").

  



  

(b) Parent shall cause the Independent Accountant to deliver a
written report of the Completed Order Audit to Parent and BiteSquad (the "
_Completed Order Audit Report_ ") concurrently and in no event later than
January 7, 2019, and if not delivered by such date (through no fault of

than the number of Audited Measurement Period Completed Orders by a
percentage amount greater than seven and one-half percent (7.5%) (the "
_Adjustment Threshold_ ") (such excess over the Adjustment Threshold, the "
_Completed Order Adjustment Percentage_ "), then the Merger Consideration
shall be reduced by an amount equal to (x) the Completed Order Adjustment
Percentage _multiplied by_ (y) the sum of (i) the Base Cash Consideration
_plus_ (ii) the Stock Consideration Value, allocated proportionally between
the Base Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration (based on the
Reference Price); and

  



    

19 
--- 

 



    



  

(ii) if the Completed Order Adjustment Percentage is zero (or a
negative number), then the Completed Order Adjustment shall be zero.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event
that the Completed Order Adjustment is greater than five percent (5%) of the
Base Merger Consideration, then Parent shall have the option in its sole
discretion to provide notice to BiteSquad, within five (5) Business Days
following receipt of the Completed Order Audit Report that it intends to deem
the Completed Order Adjustment to be equal to five percent (5%) of the Base
Merger Consideration, and if Parent elects not to deem the Completed Order
Adjustment to be 5% of the Base Merger Consideration, then BiteSquad shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ ,
which right must be exercised within five (5) Business Days following receipt
of notice from Parent contemplated in this _Section 3.3(d)_.

  



  

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Completed Order
Adjustment result in an increase in the Base Merger Consideration

  



  

Section 3.4 _Conversion of Membership Interests_.

  



  

(a) _Conversion of Series C Preferred Units_. At the Effective Time,
each Series C Preferred Unit shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, BiteSquad or any BiteSquad
Unitholder, be canceled and convert automatically into the right to receive
that portion of the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration as set forth on
the BiteSquad Closing Schedule, in each case, payable, without interest, to
the applicable BiteSquad Unitholder in accordance with _Section 3.5_ and
_Section 3.6_.

  



  

(b) _Conversion of BiteSquad Common Units_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, BiteSquad or any BiteSquad Unitholder, each issued and
outstanding BiteSquad Common Unit shall be canceled and convert
automatically into the right to receive that portion of the Cash
Consideration and Stock Consideration as set forth on the BiteSquad
Closing Schedule, in each case, payable, without interest, to the applicable
BiteSquad Unitholder in accordance with _Section 3.5_ and _Section 3.6_.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of In-the-Money Incentive Units_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of

automatically into the right to receive that portion of the Cash Consideration
and Stock Consideration as set forth on the BiteSquad Closing Schedule, in
each case, payable, without interest, to the applicable In-the-Money Incentive
Unitholder in accordance with _Section 3.5_ and _Section 3.6_. Each
Incentive Unit that is not an In-the-Money Incentive Unit shall
automatically, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of part of Parent, Merger Sub, BiteSquad or
the holders thereof, be cancelled.

(f) Subject to _Section 3.6_ , immediately after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue or pay from the Exchange
Agent Fund to each BiteSquad Unitholder that holds, immediately prior to the
Effective Time and as set forth in the BiteSquad Closing Schedule, Membership
Interests and each In-the-Money Incentive Unitholder, (i) evidence of book-
entry shares representing the number of whole shares of the aggregate Stock
Portion payable to such BiteSquad Unitholder and In-the-Money Incentive

Portion payable to such BiteSquad Unitholder and In-the-Money Incentive
Unitholder, _plus_ (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to
such BiteSquad Unitholder and In-the-Money Incentive Unitholder pursuant to
_Section 3.6(c)_ , by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account such BiteSquad Unitholders or In-the-Money Incentive Unitholders
identified in its respective BiteSquad Letter of Transmittal. Notwithstanding
anything in _Section 3.2_ or this _Section 3.5(f)_  to the contrary, with
respect to any In-the-Money Incentive Units that are subject to forfeiture
and/or redemption conditions following the Closing in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth in the applicable restricted unit award
agreement, the Cash Portion and the Stock Portion payable to the respective
In-the-Money Incentive Unitholders at the Closing shall be held in escrow by

BiteSquad Unitholders and In-the-Money Incentive Unitholders that Parent, in
its sole discretion, does not reasonably believe is an "accredited investor"
within the meaning of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Securities
Act (each, a " _Non-Accredited BiteSquad Unitholder_ "). In lieu of issuing
the shares of Parent Common Stock to which such Non-Accredited BiteSquad
Unitholder would otherwise be entitled under this _Article III_ , Parent may,
in its sole discretion, elect to pay to such Non-Accredited BiteSquad
Unitholder an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Stock Portion
payable to such Non-Accredited BiteSquad Unitholder, as set forth on the
BiteSquad Closing Statement, _multiplied by_ (ii) the Reference Price (the "
_Non-Accredited BiteSquad Unitholder Cash Payment_ "). Notwithstanding

Portion to be paid at the Closing to all BiteSquad Unitholders and In-the-
Money Incentive Unitholders that Parent, in its sole discretion, reasonably
believes is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D

Unitholders_ "), shall be increased by the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock that would have otherwise been paid to the Non-Accredited BiteSquad
Unitholders at the Closing, and such shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
allocated among the Accredited BiteSquad Unitholders on a pro rata basis in
accordance with such Accredited BiteSquad Unitholder's Percentage Interest
(without taking into account the Percentage Interests of the Non-Accredited
BiteSquad Unitholders) and (y) the aggregate Cash Portion to be disbursed by
the Exchange Agent to the Accredited BiteSquad Unitholders shall be decreased
by an amount equal to the Non-Accredited BiteSquad Unitholder Cash Payment,
and such Cash Portion shall be allocated among the Accredited BiteSquad
Unitholders on a pro rata basis in accordance with such Accredited BiteSquad
Unitholder's Percentage Interest (without taking into account the Percentage
Interests of the Non-Accredited BiteSquad Unitholders).

Section 3.6 _Procedures Regarding Membership Interests_.

  



  

(a) _Payment Procedures_. Prior to the Closing, BiteSquad shall
mail or otherwise deliver, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or
otherwise deliver, to each BiteSquad Unitholder and In-the-Money Incentive
Unitholder entitled to receive Stock Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.4(b)_ or _Section 3.4(c)_ , as the case may be, a letter of
transmittal to be agreed upon by the Parties and the Exchange Agent prior to
the Closing, which shall include the Registration Rights Agreement and the
Stockholder Lockup Agreement (the " _BiteSquad Letter of Transmittal_ ")
together with any notice required pursuant to the MN LLC Act or Section 262 of
the DGCL. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in _Article VII_, in
the event that at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a
BiteSquad Unitholder or In-the-Money Incentive Unitholder does not deliver to
the Exchange Agent a duly executed and completed BiteSquad Letter of
Transmittal, then such failure shall not alter, limit or delay the Closing;
_provided_ , that such BiteSquad Unitholder or In-the-Money Incentive
Unitholder shall not be entitled to receive its respective Stock
Portion until such Person delivers a duly executed and completed BiteSquad
Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent. Upon delivery of such duly
executed BiteSquad Letter of Transmittal, which shall include a duly executed
Registration Rights Agreement and Stockholder Lockup Agreement, by such
BiteSquad Unitholder or In-the-Money Incentive Unitholder to the Exchange
Agent, such BiteSquad Unitholder or In-the-Money Incentive Unitholder shall
be entitled to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Merger Consideration in respect of his, her or its Membership Interests
and In-the-Money Incentive Units referenced in such BiteSquad Letter of
Transmittal. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.6_ , each
Membership Interest and In-the-Money Incentive Unit shall be deemed at all
times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration to which such BiteSquad Unitholder or
In-the-Money Incentive Unitholder is entitled pursuant to this
_Article III_. Any portion of the Exchange Agent Fund that remains
undistributed to the BiteSquad Unitholders and In-the-Money
Incentive Unitholders twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Company and any BiteSquad Unitholder or In-the-
Money Incentive Unitholder that has not previously complied with this _Section
3.6(a)_ prior to the end of such twelve (12)-month period shall remain
entitled to payment of its applicable portion of the Merger Consideration but
will thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for such payment, for
which the Surviving Company shall remain obligated.

  



  

(b) _No Further Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of Membership Interests and In-the-Money Incentive Units
in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have
been exchanged and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
securities represented by such Membership Interests or In-the-Money Incentive
Units, as the case may be, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of any BiteSquad Party. From and
after the Effective Time, all BiteSquad Unitholders and In-the-Money
Incentive Unitholders shall cease to have any rights as members of BiteSquad,
except as provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law.

  



    

23 
--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no evidence of book-entry shares representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in exchange for
Membership Interests or In-the-Money Incentive Units. In lieu of the issuance
of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former BiteSquad
Unitholder or In-the-Money Incentive Unitholder that otherwise would be
entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) the Reference Price
_multiplied by_ (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock that such
BiteSquad Unitholder or In-the-Money Incentive Unitholder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article III_.

  



  

(d) _Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions declared with
respect to Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after
the Effective Time, shall be paid to any BiteSquad Unitholder or In-the-Money
Incentive Unitholder that has not delivered a properly completed, duly
executed BiteSquad Letter of Transmittal. After the delivery of a duly
executed BiteSquad Letter of Transmittal, such BiteSquad Unitholder or In-
the-Money Incentive Unitholder shall be entitled to receive any such dividends
or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which had become
payable with respect to Parent Common Stock issuable to such BiteSquad
Unitholder or In-the-Money Incentive Unitholder.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Merger Consideration Adjustments_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in no event
later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to prepare and deliver to the BiteSquad Member
Representative (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the " _Closing Balance
Sheet_ ") and (ii) a statement (together with the Closing Balance Sheet, the
" _Post-Closing Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth in detail Parent's
calculation of (A) Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time (the "
_Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (B) Transaction Expenses to the extent
unpaid at the Effective Time (the " _Closing Transaction Expenses_ "),
(C) Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Closing
Indebtedness_ "), (D) BiteSquad Cash as of immediately prior to the Closing
(the " _Closing BiteSquad Cash_ ") and (E) Cash Consideration as of the
Closing (the " _Closing Cash Consideration_ "). The Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement will be prepared, and the Closing Cash Consideration and all
components therein will be determined, in each case as of the Effective Time
in a manner consistent with the definitions set forth herein based on the
BiteSquad Parties' books and records and other information available at the
time, and in accordance with the same methodologies, principles, conventions,
policies and procedures as were used in the preparation of the Cash
Consideration in the BiteSquad Closing Schedule, including those that were
used in the preparation of the example calculation of Net Working Capital set
forth on _Exhibit A_.

  



    

24 
--- 

 



    



  

(b) If the BiteSquad Member Representative has any objections to the
Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, then the BiteSquad Member
Representative shall, within sixty (60) days after the BiteSquad Member
Representative's receipt thereof (the " _Notice Period_ "), give written
notice (the " _Objection Notice_ ") to Parent specifying in reasonable detail
such objections and the basis therefor. If the BiteSquad Member
Representative does not deliver the Objection Notice within the Notice Period,
the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement shall be final, binding and conclusive
on the BiteSquad Member Representative, the BiteSquad Unitholders, the
Incentive Unitholders and Parent. If the BiteSquad Member Representative
provides an Objection Notice within the Notice Period, then the BiteSquad
Member Representative and Parent shall negotiate in good faith regarding
objections specified in the Objection Notice only during the fifteen (15)
Business Day period (the " _Resolution Period_ ") after the date of
Parent's receipt of the Objection Notice to resolve any disputes regarding
the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement. If the BiteSquad Member Representative
and Parent are unable to resolve all such disputes within the Resolution
Period, then within five (5) Business Days after the expiration of the
Resolution Period, all unresolved disputes shall be submitted to the
Independent Accountant, who shall be engaged to provide a final, binding and
conclusive resolution of all such unresolved disputes within thirty (30)
Business Days after such engagement. The Independent Accountant shall act as
an expert and not as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on the
presentations by the BiteSquad Member Representative and Parent and not by
independent review, only those issues in the Objection Notice that remain in
dispute. Upon final resolution of all such disputed items, the Independent
Accountant shall issue a report showing its final calculation of such
disputed items. The determination of the Independent Accountant shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the BiteSquad Member Representative, the
BiteSquad Unitholders, the Incentive Unitholders and Parent. Parent shall pay
the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the BiteSquad Member Representative, the BiteSquad Unitholders and the
Incentive Unitholders (on the one hand) shall reimburse Parent for such fees
and expenses in proportion to the amounts by which its proposal differed from
the Independent Accountant's final determination, with such reimbursement to
be made from the Adjustment Escrow Account. In connection with the resolution
of any dispute, each Party shall pay its own fees and expenses, including
without limitation, legal, accounting and consultant fees and expenses.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any disputes
regarding amounts shown in the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement shall be
resolved as set forth in this _Section 3.7(b)_.

  



  

(c) (i) In the event that the Closing Cash Consideration as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 3.7_ is greater than the Estimated Cash
Consideration, then (A) Parent shall pay the amount of such difference in cash
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Exchange Agent to be
disbursed to the BiteSquad Unitholders and In-the-Money Incentive Unitholders
in accordance with the Exchange Agent Agreement, and (B) Parent and the
BiteSquad Member Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to
the Adjustment Escrow Agent to release by wire transfer of immediately
available funds the Adjustment Escrow Amount to the Exchange Agent to be
disbursed to the BiteSquad Unitholders and In-the-Money Incentive Unitholders
in accordance with the Exchange Agent Agreement; and (ii) in the event that
the Closing Cash Consideration as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
3.7_  is less than the Estimated Cash Consideration, (A) then Parent and the
BiteSquad Member Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to
the Adjustment Escrow Agent to release to Parent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds an amount equal to the portion of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount equal to such difference and, (B) thereafter, if there remains
any Adjustment Escrow Amount in the Adjustment Escrow Account, then Parent
and the BiteSquad Member Representative shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Adjustment Escrow Agent to release such balance to the
Exchange Agent to be disbursed to the BiteSquad Unitholders and In-the-
Money Incentive Unitholders in accordance with the Exchange Agent Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Adjustment
Escrow Amount shall be Parent's sole and exclusive remedy for any and all
claims it may have with respect to any adjustments to the Cash Consideration
under this Agreement and, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the
BiteSquad Unitholders and Incentive Unitholders (or any of them), the
BiteSquad Member Representative or any other Person have any obligation or
liability therefor even if the aggregate amount of such adjustments were to
exceed the balance of the Adjustment Escrow Account.

  



    

25 
--- 

 



    



  

(d) Payment of any applicable adjustment hereunder shall be made
within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the Closing
Cash Consideration hereunder.

  



  

(e) Any payment to be made pursuant to this _Section 3.7_ shall be
treated by all Parties for Tax purposes as adjustments to the

(a) Parent has filed all required registration statements, reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed by it
with the SEC since May 25, 2016 (collectively, as they have been amended since

Closing Date, then on the date of such filing), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,

designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent is made known
to Parent's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act are being prepared. To Parent's knowledge, such disclosure

claim, action or proceeding for injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief against Parent or any of its Affiliates to the extent
provided in _Section 10.13_ , unless a Qualified Termination has occurred and

; or (y) to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against Parent

Section 9.1 _Appointment_. By virtue of the adoption of this
Agreement by written consent the BiteSquad Unitholders and Incentive
Unitholders irrevocably nominate, constitute and appoint Arash Allaei (the "
_BiteSquad Member Representative_ ") as the agent and true and lawful
attorney-in-fact of the BiteSquad Unitholders and Incentive Unitholders, with
full power of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of the
BiteSquad Unitholders and Incentive Unitholders for purposes of executing any
documents and taking any actions that the BiteSquad Member Representative
may, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or
appropriate in connection with this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.2 _Authority._

  



  

(a) The BiteSquad Unitholders and Incentive Unitholders grant to the
BiteSquad Member Representative full authority to execute,
deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on behalf of the BiteSquad Unitholders
and Incentive Unitholders (in the name of any or all of the BiteSquad
Unitholders or Incentive Unitholders or otherwise) any and all documents that
the BiteSquad Member Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to
be necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such forms and containing such
provisions as the BiteSquad Member Representative may, in its sole
discretion, determine to be appropriate, in performing its/his duties as
contemplated by _Section 9.1_ , which grant shall include the irrevocable
proxy and power of attorney to take all necessary actions and execute and
deliver all documents deemed necessary and appropriate by the BiteSquad Member
Representative to effectuate the consummation of the Merger pursuant to
Section 9.2(e) of the BiteSquad Operating Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement
executed in connection with this Agreement: (i) Parent will be entitled to
deal exclusively with the BiteSquad Member Representative on all matters
relating to this Agreement (but the BiteSquad Member Representative will have
no liability for the obligations of the BiteSquad Unitholders and Incentive
Unitholders); and (ii) Parent will be entitled to rely conclusively (without
further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported
to be executed on behalf of any BiteSquad Unitholder or Incentive Unitholder
by the BiteSquad Member Representative, and on any other action taken or
purported to be taken on behalf of any BiteSquad Unitholder or Incentive
Unitholder by the BiteSquad Member Representative, as fully binding upon such

(b) _BiteSquad Member Representative Fund_. The BiteSquad Member
Representative Fund may be used at the discretion of the BiteSquad
Member Representative solely for the payment of reasonable and documented
expenses incurred in the administration of the BiteSquad
Member Representative's duties under this Agreement or any other documents or
agreements contemplated in connection with this Agreement, arising hereunder,
or otherwise related hereto. When determined in the reasonable discretion of
the BiteSquad Member Representative from time to time, the BiteSquad Member
Representative may reduce the amount of the BiteSquad Member Representative
Fund and, in connection therewith, shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the
Exchange Agent such portion of the BiteSquad Member Representative Fund to be
disbursed to the BiteSquad Unitholders and In-the-Money Incentive Unitholders
in accordance with the Exchange Agent Agreement. No interest shall be paid on
any portion of the BiteSquad Member Representative Fund that is so released
and paid to a BiteSquad Unitholder or In-the-Money Incentive Unitholder.

  



  

Section 9.3 _Power of Attorney_. The BiteSquad Unitholders and
Incentive Unitholders recognize and intend that the power of attorney granted
in _Section 9.1_  (a) is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable, (b) may
be delegated by the BiteSquad Member Representative (provided that such
delegation is reasonably acceptable to Parent) and (c) will survive the death
or incapacity of any BiteSquad Unitholder or Incentive Unitholders.

  



  

Section 9.4 _Replacement_. If the BiteSquad Member Representative
is unable to fulfill its responsibilities hereunder, the BiteSquad Unitholders
and Incentive Unitholders will (by consent of those Persons entitled to at
least a majority of the Merger Consideration), within thirty (30) days after
such dissolution or inability, appoint a successor to the BiteSquad Member
Representative and immediately thereafter notify Parent of the identity of
such successor. Any such successor will succeed the BiteSquad Member
Representative as the "BiteSquad Member Representative" hereunder. If for any
reason there is no BiteSquad Member Representative at any time, all
references herein to the BiteSquad Member Representative will be deemed to
refer to the BiteSquad Unitholders and Incentive Unitholders.

  



  

Section 9.5 _Exculpation_. The BiteSquad Member Representative
will not be liable to any BiteSquad Unitholder or Incentive Unitholder for any
act done or omitted hereunder as BiteSquad Member Representative while acting
in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or
omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel will be conclusive evidence of such
good faith. The BiteSquad Unitholders and Incentive Unitholders will jointly
and severally indemnify the BiteSquad Member Representative and hold him
harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of the BiteSquad Member
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of his duties hereunder.

NOTWITHSTANDING THOSE TERMS ANY ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM
OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIM OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY,
WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, IS BROUGHT OR MAINTAINED AGAINST
ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE OR ANY FINANCING RELATED PARTY IN ANY WAY RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE DEBT
FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF, THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT IT MAY
NOT BE BROUGHT OR MAINTAINED IN ANY FORUM OTHER THAN ANY FEDERAL COURT OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN, OR , IF THAT COURT DOES NOT HAVE SUBJECT
MATTER JURISDICTION, IN ANY STATE COURT LOCATED IN, IN EACH CASE, THE BOROUGH

OF EACH SUCH COURT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING AND WAIVES ANY OBJECTION

LAW, PARENT, MERGER SUB AND BiteSquad EACH HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY

Section 10.13 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any Party does not perform
its obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing
to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the
Merger) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief,
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_ , this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement,
and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither
BiteSquad nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each Party
agrees that it shall not oppose the granting of specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy
at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this Section shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such injunction. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall any BiteSquad Related Party be entitled to a remedy
of specific performance or other equitable remedies against any
Debt Financing Source.

  



  

Section 10.14 _Non-Recourse_. Without limiting the rights of BiteSquad
under and to the extent provided under _Section 10.13_ , this Agreement may
only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of action based upon,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the entities that are
expressly named as Parties hereto and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. Without
limiting the rights of BiteSquad under and to the extent provided under
_Section 10.13_ , except to the extent a named Party to this Agreement (and
then only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named
Party in this Agreement), (i) no past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any named Party to this
Agreement and (ii) no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing
shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for
any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or
other obligations or liabilities of any one or more of BiteSquad or Parent
under this Agreement of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 10.15 _Publicity_. All press releases or other public
communications of any nature whatsoever relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the method of the release for publication
thereof, shall prior to the Closing be subject to the prior mutual approval of
Parent and BiteSquad, in writing, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld by any Party.

  



  

Section 10.16 _Non-Survival_. None of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument, document or
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective
Time and shall expire upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, except for
those covenants and agreements contained herein and therein which by their
terms expressly apply in whole or in part after the Effective Time and then
only to such extent.

Section 10.17 _No Recourse Against Debt Financing
Sources_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (a) none of
BiteSquad, the BiteSquad Unitholders, the Incentive Unitholders or the
BiteSquad Member Representative nor any of their Affiliates, stockholders,
partners, members, officers, directors, managers, employees, controlling
persons, agents and representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf
(each a " _BiteSquad Related Party_ " and collectively the " _BiteSquad
Related Parties_ ") shall have any rights or claims (including any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise) against any Debt Financing Source or Financing Related Party in
connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment
Letter or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise and (b) no Debt Financing Source
shall have any liability (whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise) to any BiteSquad Related Party for any obligations or
liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance
thereof, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each BiteSquad Related Party agrees not to
commence (and if commenced agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate) any
action or proceeding against any Debt Financing Source or Financing Related
Party in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt
Commitment Letter or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. In
addition, in no event will any Debt Financing Source be liable to any
BiteSquad Related Parties for consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or
indirect damages (including any loss of profits, business or anticipated
savings) or damages of a tortious nature.
