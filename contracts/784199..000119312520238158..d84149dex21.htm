2.4 _Withholding_ _Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this

deduct and withhold from any payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement
any amounts required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any
applicable Tax Law (and Securityholders and their respective Affiliates shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless such Payors against any amounts of such
Taxes required to have been deducted and withheld under applicable Tax Law
from amounts payable to Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement);
_provided_ , with respect to the Closing Consideration and the IDE Approval
Consideration, any such withholding or deduction related thereto may first be
deducted from the Closing Cash Consideration or the IDE Approval Cash
Consideration, as applicable, payable to the Securityholder subject to such
withholding or deduction and to the extent the amount of any such withholding
or deduction exceeds the Closing Cash Consideration or the IDE Approval Cash
Consideration, as applicable, payable to the Securityholder, the
Securityholder shall promptly pay the applicable Payor an amount equal to such
excess and (b) reasonably request any necessary Tax forms, as applicable, and
any similar information necessary to calculate the required deduction and
withholding. Except with respect to amounts taxable as compensatory payments
or the failure by a Securityholder to deliver to Buyer at the Closing the
deliverable contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 8.2(k)_ _(ii)(A)_ , if Buyer
reasonably determines that an amount is required to be deducted or withheld,
Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice within five
(5) Business Days before any expected deduction or withholding to the Person
with respect to which the withholding is to be made and to reasonably
cooperate with such Person to reduce or eliminate any such deduction
or withholding to the extent permitted under applicable Tax Law. To the
extent that any such amounts are deducted or withheld and timely remitted by
the Payor to the applicable Governmental Authority, the amounts deducted and
withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person whose payment was deducted or withheld.

2.5  _Consideration_ _Spreadsheet_. No later than two (2) Business Days
before the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer and the Paying Agent a
spreadsheet setting forth (a) the name, mailing address and e-mail of each
Securityholder; (b) the number and class of the Company Securities held or
owned by each Securityholder, in each case as of immediately prior to the
Closing; (c) each Securityholders Pro Rata Portion of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount and Adjustment Escrow Amount; (d) each Securityholders share of the
Closing Cash Consideration payable to each such Securityholder and the Closing
Stock Consideration issuable to each such Securityholder with respect to
their respective Company Securities; (e) each Securityholders Pro Rata
Portion of each Post-Closing Consideration; (f) the

 



-4- 

    

 amount of any unpaid compensation, including bonuses payable in connection
with or related to the Acquisition, to any Person, and each Person entitled to
receive any such amount, and (g) the aggregate dollar amount contributed to
the Securityholder Representatives Reserve Fund by each Securityholder (such
spreadsheet, the " _Consideration Spreadsheet_ "). Buyer and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to rely on the Consideration Spreadsheet. The Paying Agent
shall be responsible for the distribution of such amounts delivered by Buyer
to the Paying Agent in accordance with the Consideration Spreadsheet.

 

2.6 _Other Rights in Company_ _Securities_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall terminate or shall cause to be terminated any and all rights under or
related to, and rights to acquire rights or interests in, Company Securities
transferred, granted or issued following the Effective Time in violation of

(c) Within thirty (30) days following receipt by the Securityholder
Representative of the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, the Securityholder
Representative shall deliver written notice to Buyer of any dispute it has
with respect to the preparation or content of the Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement. If the Securityholder Representative does not notify Buyer in
writing of a dispute with respect to the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement
within such thirty (30)-day period, pursuant to a written notice describing in
reasonable detail the specific calculations that are disputed and the basis
for such dispute (a " _Closing Consideration Objection Notice_ "), such Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties. In connection with the Securityholder Representatives review of the
Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, Buyer shall cause the Company to make
available, during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice, to the
Securityholder Representative and its accountants such books, records and
personnel reasonably requested by the Securityholder Representative necessary
to confirm the accuracy of the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement. If the
Securityholder Representative provides Buyer a Closing Consideration
Objection Notice within such thirty (30)-day period, Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
dispute. If Buyer and the Securityholder Representative, notwithstanding such
good faith effort, fail to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days after
the Securityholder Representative delivers the Closing Consideration Objection
Notice, then Buyer and the Securityholder Representative jointly shall be
entitled to engage the Arbitration Firm to resolve such dispute. As promptly
as practicable thereafter (and, in any event, within thirty (30) days after
the Arbitration Firms engagement), the Securityholder Representative shall
submit to the Arbitration Firm in writing (with a copy to Buyer) any
unresolved elements of the Securityholder Representatives objection,
supported by any documents and arguments upon which the Securityholder
Representative relies. As promptly as practicable thereafter (and, in any
event, within fifteen (15) days following the Securityholder Representatives
submission of such objection), Buyer shall submit to the Arbitration Firm
(with a copy to the Securityholder Representative) Buyers response to the
Securityholders objection supported by any documents and arguments upon which
Buyer relies. Buyer and the Securityholder Representative shall request that
the Arbitration Firm render its determination within fifty (50) days
following its receipt of Buyers response. The scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Arbitration Firm shall be limited to the unresolved items to
which the Securityholder Representative specifically objected in the Closing
Consideration Objection Notice. Any item or calculation not set forth in the
Closing Consideration Objection Notice shall be deemed final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties. In resolving any disputed item based on GAAP, the
Arbitration Firm shall use GAAP and may not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value claimed for such item by either Party or less than the
smallest value claimed for such item by either Party. All determinations made
by the Arbitration Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties.
All fees and costs of the Arbitration Firm in resolving any disputed item
shall be payable by Buyer, on the one hand, and the Securityholder
Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders), on the other hand, based
upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to
each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party, as determined
by the Arbitration Firm at the time the determination of such firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted.

(d) If the Company Cash listed on the Statement of Cash, A/R, A/P and GAAP
Liabilities exceeds the Company Cash as of the Closing (as finally determined

this Agreement will be adjusted downward by an amount equal to such excess.
If the Accounts Payable of the Company as of the Closing (as finally

of Adjustment Items delivered prior to the Closing by the Company to Buyer
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a_ _)(_ _iv)_ , exceeds the Adjustment Items
(as finally determined after the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_),

(b) Within thirty (30) days following receipt by the Securityholder
Representative of the Additional Consideration Statement, the Securityholder
Representative shall deliver written notice to Buyer of any dispute it has
with respect to the preparation or content of the Additional Consideration

the Parties, and the Proposed Additional Consideration Amount will be the
final Additional Consideration Amount for all purposes under this Agreement.
If the Securityholder Representative provides Buyer an Additional

shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail
to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days after the Securityholder
Representative delivers the Additional Consideration Objection Notice, then
Buyer and the Securityholder Representative shall engage the Arbitration Firm
to resolve such dispute. As promptly as practicable thereafter (and, in any
event, within thirty (30) days after the Arbitration Firms engagement), the
Securityholder Representative shall submit to the Arbitration Firm in
writing (with a copy to Buyer) any unresolved elements of its objection,
supported by any documents and arguments upon which it relies. As promptly as
practicable thereafter (and, in any event, within fifteen (15) days following
the Securityholder Representatives submission of such unresolved elements),
Buyer shall submit its response to the Arbitration Firm (with a copy to the
Securityholder Representative) supported by any documents and arguments upon
which it relies. Buyer and the Securityholder Representative shall request
that the Arbitration Firm render its determination within fifty (50) days
following its receipt of Buyers response. The scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Arbitration Firm shall be limited to the unresolved items to
which the Securityholder Representative objected in such Additional
Consideration Objection Notice. Any item or calculation not set forth in an
Additional Consideration Objection Notice shall be deemed final, conclusive
and binding on the Parties. In resolving any disputed item, the Arbitration
Firm shall use GAAP and may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value claimed for such item by either Party or less than the smallest
value claimed for such item by either Party. In no event shall the
Arbitration Firm order payment of any Additional Consideration Amount that is
in excess of the Additional Consideration Cap. All determinations made by the
Arbitration Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. All
fees and costs of the Arbitration Firm in resolving any disputed item shall be
payable by Buyer, on the one hand, and the Securityholder Representative (on
behalf of the Securityholders), on the other hand, based upon the percentage
which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to

the matters submitted.

Securityholder Representative shall update the Consideration Spreadsheet to
include (i) each Securityholders share of the Additional Consideration
Amount, payable to each such Securityholder with respect to their respective
Company Securities and (ii) each Securityholders Pro Rata Portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount and Adjustment Escrow Amount, updated to reflect the
allocation of the Additional Consideration Amount (the " _Updated
Consideration Spreadsheet_ "), and deliver such Updated Consideration
Spreadsheet to Buyer and the Paying Agent. Within ten (10) Business Days
thereafter, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the Paying Agent the
Additional Consideration Amount for further distribution to each of the
Securityholders their respective portion of the Additional Consideration
Amount, less any applicable Taxes and amounts required to be withheld pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, all in accordance with the Updated Consideration
Spreadsheet. The Paying Agent shall be responsible for the distribution of
the Additional Consideration Amount delivered by Buyer to the Paying Agent in
accordance with the Updated Consideration Spreadsheet.

(d) Buyer will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts in the commercialization
and sale of the Solution following the Closing Date until the determination
date of the Additional Consideration Amount, but Buyer shall not have a duty
to sell the Solution, a duty to pursue the PMA Approval, the IDE Approval, the
JPMDA Approval or the CNMPA Approval or a duty to ensure that any Post-
Closing Consideration is earned. The Securityholder Representative shall have
an opportunity to ask certain Representatives of Buyer reasonably designated
by Buyer questions regarding, and to discuss with such Representatives, at
reasonably agreed times during normal business hours, the then status of
progress to obtain the IDE Approval, the PMA Approval, the JPMDA Approval, and
the CNMPA Approval and the then status of the sales of the Solution
and revenues generated in connection with such sales. Buyer will (and will
require that its Affiliates will) maintain complete and accurate records in
sufficient detail to permit the Securityholder Representative to verify
accurately whether Buyer has achieved the IDE Approval, the PMA Approval, the
JPMDA Approval, the CNMPA Approval and the Additional Consideration Amount.
Subject to the Securityholder Representative entering into a confidentiality
agreement with Buyer on terms reasonably acceptable to Buyer, Buyer will
provide the Securityholder Representative with a reasonably detailed summary
of the status of progress toward achievement of the IDE Approval, the PMA
Approval, the JPMDA Approval, the CNMPA Approval and the Additional
Consideration Amount, along with financial and other relevant records
evidencing such information within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of
a written request from the Securityholder Representative for such a summary; 
_provided_ , _however,_ that (i) Buyer shall not be required to respond to any
such request more than two (2) times in any twelve (12)-month period, and (ii)
with respect to its obligations in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_, Buyer shall
not be required to provide the Securityholder Representative with any
information that constitutes material non-public information under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

(e) If Buyer determines that it will not pursue the JPMDA Approval or if JPMDA
Approval is not received prior to June 30, 2027, whichever occurs first, then
the amount of the JPMDA Approval Payment will be added to the Additional
Consideration Cap; _provided_ , that Buyers obligation to pay the JPMDA
Approval Payment shall terminate immediately if the Additional Consideration
Cap is adjusted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(e)_, even if JPMDA
Approval subsequently obtained.

 

(f) If Buyer determines that it will not pursue the CNMPA Approval or if CNMPA
Approval is not received prior to June 30, 2027, whichever occurs first, then
the amount of the CNMPA Approval Payment will be added to the Additional
Consideration Cap; _provided_ , that Buyers obligation to pay the CNMPA
Approval Payment shall terminate immediately if the Additional Consideration
Cap is adjusted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_, even if CNMPA
Approval subsequently obtained.

(g) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control with respect to the Company,
Buyer shall require the acquiror in such Change of Control to assume Buyers
obligations to pay the Post-Closing Consideration under this Agreement,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, that have not been
paid prior to the consummation of such Change of Control.

3.3 _Tax Treatment_. The adjusted payment obligations contemplated in
_Sections_ __ _ 2.3(d)_, _2.3(e)_ , _2.3(f)_ , _2.3(g)_ , _2.3(h)_ and _2.3(_

purposes as adjustments to the Acquisition Consideration, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law.

been an Employee hereby assigns to the Company any moral rights in any of the
Company Intellectual Property of such Securityholder and such
Securityholders Affiliates.

7.8 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Returns_. The Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders) shall cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the Company
required to be filed after the Closing for any and all Pre-Closing Tax Periods
and all income Tax Returns of the Company for all Tax periods ending on or
before the Closing Date (each a " _Pre-Closing Tax Return_"), and Buyer shall
prepare (or cause to be prepared) any and all Tax Returns of the Company for
all other Straddle Periods (each a " _Straddle Tax Return_ ") and any Pre-
Closing Tax Returns that the Securityholder Representative does not cause to
be prepared pursuant to the preceding clause, which all such Tax Returns shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice except to the extent
required by applicable Law or otherwise consented to by the Non-Preparing
Party. Reasonable and documented third-party costs and expenses incurred
by Buyer with respect to a Straddle Tax Return shall be equitably apportioned
between the Securityholders and Buyer based on the relative responsibility for
Taxes in respect of such Straddle Tax Return, and the Securityholder
Representative (on the Securityholders behalf) shall promptly pay to Buyer
upon its request the amount of the Securityholders portion thereof (which
shall not be less than zero) out of the Securityholder Representatives
Reserve Fund. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including
extensions) for filing any such Tax Return, the Party preparing such Tax
Return (the " _Preparing Party_ ") shall deliver a draft of such Tax Return,
together with all supporting documentation and workpapers, to the other Party
(the " _Non-Preparing Party_") for its review and reasonable comment (other
than (i) Tax Returns relating to sales, use, payroll, or other Taxes that are
required to be filed contemporaneously with, or promptly after, the close of a
Tax period, which shall be provided as promptly as practicable, or (ii) Tax
Returns not described in clause (i) that are due within forty-five (45) days
of the Closing Date, which shall be provided as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date (such Tax Returns described in clauses (i) and (ii)
hereafter referred to as " _Expedited Tax Returns_ ")). The Preparing Party
shall revise any of the Pre-Closing Tax Returns or Straddle Tax Returns, as
applicable, to take into account any and all reasonable comments received from
the Non-Preparing Party not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date
(including extensions) for filing such Tax Return (or, in the case of an
Expedited Tax Return, received reasonably in advance of such due date) and
shall deliver a final copy of such Tax Return to the Non-Preparing Party not
less than five (5) days prior to such due date (or, in the case of an
Expedited Tax Return, as promptly as practicable). Buyer shall cause each
Pre-Closing Tax Return and Straddle Tax Return (as revised to incorporate any
timely reasonable comments pursuant to the procedures above) to be timely
executed and filed and cause all Taxes shown as due thereon to be timely
remitted, and the Securityholder Representative (on the Securityholders
behalf) shall pay to Buyer the amount of Seller Taxes shown on each such Tax
Return at least five (5) Business Days prior to the due date therefor (or, in
the case of an Expedited Tax Return, as promptly as practicable after delivery
of a final copy of such Tax Return).

 

(b) _Straddle Period Taxes_. In the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes that is
attributable to the portion of the period ending on the day immediately before
the Closing Date will be:

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible, or intangible) but subject
to  _Section_ __ _ 7.8(b)(iii)_ below, deemed equal to the amount that would
be payable as computed on a "closing of the books" basis if the relevant
Straddle Period of the Company (and each partnership in which the Company is
a partner) ended on the day immediately before the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
that exemptions, allowances, or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) will be allocated
between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the day immediately
before the Closing Date and the remainder of such Straddle Period in
proportion to the number of days in each period;

 



-46- 

    

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of the Company, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the day immediately before the
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the
entire Straddle Period; and

 

(iii) for purposes of all income or similar Tax Returns of or pertaining to
the Company and its activities, any deductions available to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries for costs, expenses, or payments borne by or
attributable to the Securityholders under this Agreement, including without
limitation all Adjustment Items and Third Party Transaction Expense, shall be
treated as pertaining to the period before the Closing and be reported and
reportable on a Pre-Closing Tax Return of the Company, to the greatest extent
permitted under applicable Tax Law.

 

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, value
added, goods and services, excise, registration and other similar Taxes, and
all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (including
any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with consummation of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be
paid fifty percent (50%) by Securityholders and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer
when due. The Securityholder Representative will (i) at the expense of the
Securityholders, prepare, or cause to be prepared, all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, (ii) submit
such Tax Returns and other documentation to Buyer for its review and comment
reasonably in advance of the due date therefor, and (iii) timely file, or
cause to be timely filed, such Tax Returns and other documentation,
incorporating any reasonable comments received from Buyer prior to the due
date therefor. If required by applicable Law, Buyer will, and will cause
its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

(d) _Cooperation_. Buyer, the Company and the Securityholder Representative,
on behalf of the Securityholders, shall cooperate, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with (i) the filing of
any Tax Returns of or with respect to the Business, the Company, or the
operations of the Company, and (ii) any audit, examination, voluntary
disclosure or other administrative or judicial proceeding, contest,
assessment, notice of deficiency, or other adjustment or proposed adjustment
with respect to Taxes of the Business, the Company, or the operations of the
Company (a " _Tax Contest_ "). Such cooperation shall include obtaining and
providing appropriate forms, retaining and providing records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Contest, and
making Employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder.
Except to the extent provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.8(d)_, the conduct
of Tax Contests shall be treated as a Third Party Claim for purposes of
_Section_ __ _ 9.4(f)_. The Party controlling any such Tax Contest pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ shall: (w) keep the other Party reasonably
informed of each material development of such Tax Contest, (x) consult in good
faith with the other Party before taking any material action with respect
to the conduct of such Tax Contest, (y) permit the other Party to participate
in any such Tax Contest at the other Partys sole cost and expense, and (z)
not settle or compromise such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of
the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, upon the request of Buyer with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or a Straddle Period, the Securityholders and the Securityholder
Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders) and each of their respective
Affiliates shall cooperate fully with the Company, the Buyer and its
Affiliates and Representatives in connection with Buyers efforts to (1)
avoid or minimize the application of the company-level audit and adjustment
rules of

 



-47- 

    

 the Bipartisan Budget Act (or any similar federal, state or local Tax Law,
if applicable), (2) make an election under Section 6226(a) of the Code,
commonly known as the "push out" election (or any similar election under
state or local Tax Law, if applicable), or (3) reduce an "imputed
underpayment" (as determined under the Code or any similar adjustment under
state or local Tax Law, if applicable) by utilizing the procedure described
in Section 6225(c)(2)(B) of the Code, commonly known as the "pull-in"
procedure (or any similar procedure under state or local Tax Law, if
applicable).

 

(e) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any Tax sharing, indemnification or allocation
Contract, arrangement, practice or policy to which the Company is a party or
by which it is bound (other than any commercial Contract with customary terms
entered into in the ordinary course of business of the Company and the
principal purpose of which is unrelated to Taxes) shall be terminated as
of the Closing Date, and the Company shall not have any liability or
obligation pursuant thereto.

(f) _Agreed Tax Treatment and Tax Allocation_. In reliance upon the
representations and warranties of the Securityholders and the Company
regarding the Company, including, for the avoidance of doubt, _Sections_ __ _
5.31(v)_ and _5.31(x)_ , the Parties agree that, for U.S. federal (and
conforming U.S. state and local) income Tax purposes, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated consistent with IRS Revenue
Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432 (Situation 2), including that: (i) with respect
to Buyer, Buyer is treated as acquiring the Company assets and (ii) with
respect to the Securityholders, the Securityholders are treated as selling the
Company Securities (such Tax treatment, the " _Agreed Tax Treatment_ "), and
the Parties will not file (or fail to file) any Tax Return or otherwise take
any position with respect to Taxes that is inconsistent with the Agreed Tax
Treatment as finally determined, except to the extent required by a final
"determination" pursuant to Section 1313 of the Code (or a similar
determination under U.S. state or local or non-U.S. Tax Law). Within sixty
(60) days of the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_, Buyer shall provide to the
Securityholder Representative a schedule allocation of the Acquisition
Consideration and any other amounts properly treated as consideration for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes among the Companys assets and the Non-
Competition Agreements in accordance with Sections 751 and 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the " _Asset Allocation Schedule_
"). Buyer and the Securityholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith
and use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute
with respect to the Asset Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days after
the Securityholder Representatives receipt of the draft Asset Allocation
Schedule (or such longer period as they may mutually agree). If Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative reach a written agreement with respect to the
Asset Allocation Schedule, the Asset Allocation Schedule shall be revised to
take into account any subsequent adjustments to the Acquisition Consideration
or any other amounts properly treated as consideration for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes in the manner consistent with Sections 751 and 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, and the Parties will not file
(or fail to file) any Tax Return or otherwise take any position with respect
to Taxes that is inconsistent with the Asset Allocation Schedule as finally
determined, except to the extent required by a final "determination" pursuant
to Section 1313 of the Code (or a similar determination under U.S. state or
local or non-U.S. Tax Law).

(g) _Post-Closing Amendments or Changes_. Except as required by applicable
Tax Law or otherwise set forth below or provided for in this Agreement, Buyer
may not (and may not cause or permit the Company to) (i) amend or refile (or
grant an extension of any statute of limitations with respect to) any of the
Pre-Closing Tax Returns or any Straddle Tax Returns relating in whole or in
part to the Company, or (ii) make any Tax election that has retroactive effect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period, in each case, without
giving the Securityholder Representative a reasonable opportunity to review
and approve such amendment, refiling or election (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided, however_ , that
such review and approval shall not be necessary if (A) the positions taken in
any such Tax Return do not increase Seller Taxes or (B) the Parties agree
in writing that any additional Taxes resulting therefrom will not be deemed
to constitute Seller Taxes.

 



-48- 

    

(h) _Tax Refunds_. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Company relating
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period (including overpayments of
Taxes for such Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period that the recipient
chooses to offset against a Tax Liability but excluding payments made by
Buyer or the Company after the Closing), to the extent allocable to the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on the day immediately before the
Closing Date pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.8(b)_, will be for the benefit of
the Securityholders except to the extent any such refund or credit is
reflected in the Updated Statement of Liabilities and Assets. Any refunds or
credits of Taxes of the Company for any Straddle Period, to the extent
allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period beginning on the Closing Date
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.8(b)_, or for any Tax period beginning on the
Closing Date, will be solely for the benefit of Buyer. Each Party shall
promptly pay, and shall cause its Affiliates to promptly pay, the Party
entitled to receive a refund of Tax pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.8(h)_
the amount of such refund actually received in cash (including any interest
thereon from the taxing authority), net of any reasonable third-party costs or
expenses incurred by such Party or its Affiliates in procuring such refund.

 

(i) _Limitations on Tax Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (i) in no event will the Securityholders have any
liability or indemnification obligation with respect to the amount,
availability or use of any Tax assets of the Company (including, but not
limited to, the Tax basis of the Companys assets and losses or deductions
of the Company) in any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date that
are attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and (ii) none of the payments
required to be made by or on behalf of the Securityholders or the
Securityholder Representative pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ shall be
paid out of or otherwise reduce the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund or
Adjustment Escrow Fund.

 

7.9 _Securityholder_ _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, and subject to
the consummation thereof, each Securityholder (in its capacity as such), on
behalf of such Securityholder and such Securityholders heirs, executors,
estates, devisees, Affiliates, and each of their respective heirs, executors,
estates, devisees, successors and assigns (each, a " _Releasing Person_ "),
hereby absolutely, unconditionally, and irrevocably releases, acquits and
forever discharges and covenants not to sue, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, the Company and, to the extent of any derivative claims

interest to the Company, Buyer and each of their respective current and past
managers, officers, directors, equity holders, Affiliates, service providers,

respective heirs, executors, estates, devisees, successors and assigns) (each,
a " _Released Person_ ") of, from and against any and all Liabilities,
obligations, actions, causes of action, claims, expenses, demands, damages,
judgments, debts, dues and suits of every kind, nature and description
whatsoever, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, both at law
and in equity, which such Releasing Person has at any time prior to the
Closing Date had, on the Closing Date has or thereafter may have, whether or
not pending on or asserted after the Closing, against any Released Person for
or by reason of any matter, cause or thing, in each case occurring on or
prior to the Closing Date (the " _Released Holder Claims_ "), including
matters arising in connection with such Securityholders ownership prior to
the Closing Date of any Company Securities or such Securityholders
contractual or other arrangements with the Company prior to the Closing Date;
_provided, however_ , nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ shall
affect or be deemed to be construed as a waiver or release of any claims or
rights arising from or relating to (a) accrued benefits under applicable Law
or Contract to which such Releasing Person is entitled or for any unpaid
salary, expense reimbursement, bonuses (including retention bonuses), change
of control or severance payments, or any similar employee-related benefits, in
respect of services performed by the Releasing Person as an Employee, officer
or director of, or consultant to, the Company prior to the Closing (b) any

any rights that the Releasing Person may have to indemnification by the

insurance policy, in each case, to the extent provided in _Section_ __ _
7.16_, (d) rights under any offer letter, employment agreement or retention
agreement between Releasing Person and any of the Company, Buyer, or any of
their Affiliates that by their terms expressly survive the Closing, (e) any
claims that cannot be released as a matter of Law, and (f) claims between a
Securityholder, on the one hand, and an Employee or another Securityholder, on
the other hand, pertaining to matters entirely unrelated to the Company, the
Business, this Agreement and the Related Agreements; and any such matters
described in the immediately preceding clauses (a) through (f) shall not be
deemed Released Holder Claims hereunder. Each Securityholder (x) understands
that the release contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ is binding on such
Securityholder and such Securityholders heirs, executors, estates, devisees,
Affiliates, and each of their respective heirs, executors, estates, devisees,
successors and assigns, in accordance with its terms, effective as of the
Closing, and subject to the consummation thereof, (y) represents and warrants
that (i) such Securityholder has had the opportunity to consult with counsel

the Company or any Released Person based upon any of the Released Holder
Claims (the " _Securityholder_ _Release_ ").

 

7.10 _Post-Closing Delivery of Records_. Within fourteen (14) days following
the Closing, the Securityholders shall deliver or otherwise make available to
Buyer all of the Company books and records that were not made available to
Buyer prior to the Closing.

7.11  _Restrictions on Other Transfers and Issuances_. During the Interim
Period, the Securityholders will not sell, convey, transfer, gift or otherwise
dispose of (a " _Disposition_ ") any Company Securities held or owned by
them, unless (a) such proposed transferee agrees to the terms and provisions
of, and to be bound by, this Agreement by executing a joinder and depositing
its Transfer Instruments with the Securityholder Representative and (b)
the Company gives notice to Buyer of each such transfer.

7.12 _Financial Statements_. On or before September 15, 2020,
the Securityholders shall deliver to Buyer Year-End Financials as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2019 and the Interim Financials and an unaudited

GAAP and (except for the June 30, 2019 financial statements) have been
"reviewed" in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement on Standards for Accounting and Review No. 21 by James
Moore and Company (together with all supporting schedules).

 

7.13 _Lock-Up Agreement_. Without the prior written consent of Buyer, each
Securityholder will not, during the period commencing on the date of this
Agreement and ending on, in the case of Ali Shahriari and his Related Parties,

Securityholder, the date that is six (6) months following the Closing Date,

transaction or arrangement that transfers or that is designed to, or that
might reasonably be expected to, result in the transfer to another, in whole
or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of Buyer Common
Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (a) or (b) above is to
be settled by delivery of shares of Buyer Common Stock, in cash or otherwise;
_provided_ ,

 



-50- 

    

 that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to transfers of shares of
Buyer Common Stock (i) as a bona fide gift, (ii) in the case of a
Securityholder that is an entity, as a distribution to such Securityholders
limited partners, members, stockholders or trust beneficiaries or (iii) by
will or other testamentary document or intestate succession upon death of the
Securityholders or by operation of law so long as, in each case of clause
(i), (ii) and (iii), the done, transferee, heir, beneficiary or distributee
agrees in writing prior to such transfer for the express benefit of Buyer
(with a copy thereof to be furnished to Buyer) to be bound by
the Securityholders obligations under this Agreement with respect to the
such shares of Buyer Common Stock.

7.14 _Termination of Employees_. The Company shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to terminate each employee of the Company effective prior to the

any Distributor Agreement if pursuant to written direction received from
Buyer.

7.16 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification_. For a period of

rights to be indemnified for, and to be advanced expenses with respect to, any
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing to the extent
provided under the Articles of Organization and the Operating Agreement;
_provided_ , that none of Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary shall be
obligated to indemnify or advance any expenses to any DandO Indemnified Party
for amounts such DandO Indemnified Party owes or may owe to Buyer in such DandO
Indemnified Partys capacity as a Securityholder pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (including _Article_ __ _ IX_). In the event that any claim
for indemnification or advancement of expenses is asserted or made within
such six (6)-year period, all rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses provided in this _Section_ __ _ 7.16_ will continue until such claim
is disposed of or all orders, injunctions, judgments, decrees or rulings of
any Governmental Authority in connection with such claim are fully satisfied.
This _Section_ __ _ 7.16_ will survive the Closing and is expressly intended
to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Party and
their respective heirs and legal representatives. In the event that the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or
assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (b) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, in each such case, proper provision will be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Company or the its Subsidiaries will
expressly assume and succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 7.16_.

 

7.17 _Securities Laws Compliance_.

 

(a) On the condition that the Securityholders representations and warranties
set forth in this Agreement are complete and accurate, Buyer agrees to timely
file a Form D with respect to the offering of the Stock Consideration. On the
condition that the representations and warranties of each Securityholder set
forth in _Article_ __ _ IV_ are complete and accurate, Buyer, on or before
the Closing Date, shall take such action as Buyer shall reasonably determine
is necessary in order to obtain an exemption for the issuance of the Stock
Consideration to the Securityholders at the Closing pursuant to
this Agreement under applicable securities or "Blue Sky" Laws of the states
of the United States. On the condition that the representations and warranties
of each Securityholder set forth in _Article_ __ _ IV_ are complete
and accurate, Buyer shall make all filings and reports relating to the offer
and sale of the Stock Consideration as Buyer shall reasonably determine are
required under applicable securities or "Blue Sky" Laws of the states of the
United States following the Closing Date.

 



-51- 

    

(b) Each Securityholder acknowledges and agrees that each certificate or book
entry evidencing shares of Buyer Common Stock issued as Stock Consideration
(such shares, " _Acquisition Shares_ ") shall bear a restrictive legend
stating that such shares of Buyer Common Stock have not been registered under
the Securities Act and may not be offered for sale, sold or otherwise
transferred without registration or in compliance with an applicable exemption
from registration. Upon the written request of a Securityholder, such
restrictive legend shall be removed and Buyer shall issue a certificate
without restrictive legend to the holder of the applicable Acquisition Shares
upon which it is stamped or, if applicable, issue to such holder by electronic
delivery at the applicable balance account at DTC (or, if the Acquisition
Shares are held in book-entry form in the account records of Buyers transfer
agent, remove any account holds, stops, or legends on such holders book-entry
account), if (i) such Acquisition Shares are registered for resale under the
Securities Act, (ii) such Acquisition Shares are sold or transferred pursuant
to Rule 144, or (iii) such Acquisition Shares are eligible for sale under Rule
144, without the requirement for Buyer to be in compliance with the current
public information required under Rule 144(c) (or Rule 144(i)(2), if
applicable) as to such securities and without volume or manner-of-sale
restrictions; _provided_ , that as a condition to any such restrictive legend
removal pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii), Buyer may require and subject such
restrictive legend removal to the delivery of an opinion of counsel in form
and substance satisfactory to Buyer, acting reasonably, to the effect that
registration of the Acquisitions Shares under the Securities Act is not
required in connection with such transfer and such legend may thereafter be
removed. Upon Rule 144 becoming available for the resale of Acquisition
Shares, without the requirement for Buyer to be in compliance with the current
public information required under Rule 144(c) (or Rule 144(i)(2), if
applicable) as to the Acquisition Shares and without volume or manner-of-sale
restrictions, Buyer, upon the written request of the Securityholder, shall
instruct the transfer agent to remove the legend from the Acquisition Shares;
_provided_ , that as a condition to any such restrictive legend removal, Buyer
may require and subject such restrictive legend removal to the delivery of an
opinion of counsel in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer, acting
reasonably, to the effect that such legend may be removed. Any fees with
respect to the transfer agent or Buyer counsel associated with the removal of
such legend shall be borne by Buyer, other than expenses incurred by such
Securityholder on its own behalf and applicable Taxes. If a legend is no
longer required pursuant to the foregoing, Buyer will no later than five (5)
Business Days following the delivery by a Securityholder to the transfer
agent (with notice to Buyer) of a legended certificate or instrument
representing such Acquisition Shares (endorsed or with stock powers attached,
signatures guaranteed, and otherwise in form necessary to affect the
reissuance and/or transfer) and a customary representation letter to the
extent required by Buyer counsel, deliver or cause to be delivered to such
Securityholder a certificate or instrument (as the case may be) representing
such Acquisition Shares that is free from all restrictive legends or, if such
Acquisition Shares are in book-entry form, evidence or confirmation that any
account stops, transfer restrictions, or legends have been removed from such
book-entry account. 

7.18 _Contract Terminations_. The Company shall cause the Contracts listed in
_Exhibit_ __ _ J_ to be terminated effective on or before 12:01 a.m. Eastern
Time on the Closing Date and provide Buyer evidence of such terminations.

reasonably available to Buyer as of the date of such Officers Certificate.

 

(ii) In order to seek indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_, the
Securityholder Representative shall deliver a Claim Certificate to Buyer at
any time before 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the applicable Survival Date. The
Securityholder Representative shall deliver a Claim Certificate promptly upon
the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Seller Indemnified
Persons) concluding it intends to assert a claim for indemnification;
_provided, however_ , the failure to promptly deliver a Claim Certificate
shall not affect the Seller Indemnified Persons right to recover Losses
under  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_, except to the extent the Buyer is materially
prejudiced by such failure. For the purposes hereof, " _Claim Certificate_ "
shall mean a certificate signed by the Securityholder Representative: (x)
stating that a Seller Indemnified Person has paid, sustained or incurred or
reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain or incur Losses, and
(y) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included
in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid, sustained or
incurred, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the
(1) misrepresentation, (2) breach or inaccuracy of a representation
or warranty, (3) breach or failure to perform a covenant or other agreement,
or (4) other basis for indemnity to which such item is related, but in each
case only to the extent such information is reasonably available to the
Securityholder Representative as of the date of such Claim Certificate.

the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Securityholder Representatives Reserve
Fund) _plus_ any Post-Closing Consideration that becomes due and payable
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (ignoring the effect of any
indemnification claims) (the " _10% Cap_ "), in which case each Securityholder
shall make payment directly to such Buyer Indemnified Person by wire transfer
of immediately available cash funds to an account designated by such Buyer
Indemnified Person (subject to the Individual Consideration Cap) and/or a
Buyer Indemnified Person shall be entitled, at its option, to recover such

_Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(_ _i_ _)_ (except in the event of Fraud) or under 
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(ii)_ through _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(v)_, then, subject
to the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ or otherwise in this
Agreement, the Buyer Indemnified Person must recover Losses, _first_ from the

available cash funds to an account designated by such Seller Indemnified
Person; provided that such payment shall not exceed in the aggregate with all
other indemnification payments made by Buyer the amount of
consideration payable by Buyer to the Securityholders hereunder.

(ix) In no event will any Securityholder be obligated to make any payments
directly to a Buyer Indemnified Person in respect of a Loss pursuant to this
_Article_ __ _ IX_ in an aggregate amount in excess of the Acquisition
Consideration actually received by such Securityholder (including any Post-
Closing Consideration actually received by such Securityholder) (the "
_Individual Consideration Cap_ "); _provided_ that, for the avoidance of
doubt, (i) amounts funded to the Indemnity Escrow Fund or the Adjustment

Indemnity Escrow Fund or the Adjustment Escrow Fund to a Buyer Indemnified
Person on behalf of a Securityholder and all or any portion of any Post-
Closing Consideration that becomes due or payable pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement but is subject to an offset, in each case, shall not be deemed
amounts received by a Securityholder or a payment a Securityholder is
obligated to make as used in this _ Section_ __ _ 9.4(c)(ix)_ and (ii) if
any Post-Closing Consideration is actually received by a Securityholder
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement after the time a Loss has been limited
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(c)(ix)_, the Individual Consideration
Cap shall be re-calculated to include such amounts, and such Buyer Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to recover any unsatisfied portion of such Losses
directly from such Securityholder.

(d) _Objections to Claims for Indemnification_. The payment of any amount
under _Section_ __ _ 9.4(c)_ shall be delayed pending resolution pursuant to

pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_, the Securityholder Representative shall
object to the claim made in the Officers Certificate in a written statement
labeled "Objection Notice" (an " _Objection Notice_ "), and such Objection
Notice shall have been received by Buyer and, if such claim involves a claim
against the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent, prior to 12:01 a.m.
Eastern Time on the thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of the Officers
Certificate, or (ii) with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to

Certificate in an Objection Notice, and such Objection Notice shall have been
received by the Securityholder Representative prior to 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time
on the thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of the Claim Certificate. If the
Securityholder Representative (with respect to any claim for indemnification

indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_) (as applicable, the "
_Responding Party_ ") does not object in writing within such thirty (30)-day
period, such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by
the Responding Party that the Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified
Person, as applicable, is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses
set forth in such Officers Certificate or Claim Certificate, and payment in
respect of such Losses shall thereafter be made in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 9.4(c)_, except that, to the extent that the amount of the Losses set
forth in the Officers Certificate or Claim Certificate is an estimate, the
Buyer Indemnified Person or the Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, will
not be so entitled to receive, and the Escrow Agent will not deliver, funds
in respect of such portions of such estimated Losses unless and until the
amount of such estimated Losses is finally determined either by the joint
written instructions from the Securityholder Representative and Buyer or by
a final, non-appealable order, decree or judgment of a court in accordance
with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 11.7_, the time for perfection of an
appeal of such final, non-appealable order, decree or judgment having expired.

 



-63- 

    

(e) _Resolution of Conflicts_.

 

(i) In case the Responding Party delivers an Objection Notice in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 9.4(d)_, the Securityholder Representative and Buyer
shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective Persons
with respect to each of such claims. If the Securityholder Representative and
Buyer should so agree, a document setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both the Securityholder Representative and Buyer. To
the extent such claim is recoverable from the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant
to the terms of this _Article_ __ _ IX_, the Securityholder Representative
and Buyer shall furnish a copy of such signed document to the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement. Payment in respect of such Losses shall
thereafter be made in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(c)_, except that,
to the extent that the amount of the Losses set forth in the Officers
Certificate or Claim Certificate is an estimate, Buyer Indemnified Person or
Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, will not be so entitled to receive,
and the Escrow Agent will not deliver, funds in respect of such portions of
such estimated Losses unless and until the amount of such estimated Losses is
finally determined either by the joint written instructions from the
Securityholder Representative and Buyer or by a final, non-appealable order,
decree or judgment of a court in accordance with the provisions of _Section_
__ _ 11.7_, the time for perfection of an appeal of such final, non-
appealable order, decree or judgment having expired.

 

(ii) If no such agreement can be reached before the twentieth (20th) Business
Day following delivery of an Objection Notice by the Responding Party or in
the event of any dispute arising pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ IX_, either
Buyer, on the one hand, or the Securityholder Representative, on the other
hand, may bring an action against the other to resolve the dispute in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.7_. Once a final resolution of any dispute
in accordance with this Section is obtained, payment in respect of such Losses
shall thereafter be made in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.4(c)_, except
that, to the extent that the amount of the Losses set forth in the Officers
Certificate or Claim Certificate is an estimate, the Buyer Indemnified Person
or the Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, will not be so entitled to
receive, and the Escrow Agent will not deliver, funds in respect of such
portions of such estimated Losses unless and until the amount of such
estimated Losses is finally determined either by the joint written
instructions from the Securityholder Representative and Buyer or by a final,
non-appealable order, decree or judgment of a court in accordance with the
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 11.7_, the time for perfection of an appeal of
such final, non-appealable order, decree or judgment having expired.

 

(f) _Third Party Claims_.

 

(i) If a Buyer Indemnified Person desires to seek indemnification with respect
to a third party claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") pursuant to this _Article_
__ _ IX_, Buyer shall notify the Escrow Agent (if the Third Party Claim is
made by Buyer or a Buyer Indemnified Person prior to the release of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund and may result in a claim against the Indemnity Escrow
Fund) and the Securityholder Representative in writing of such claim,
describing in reasonable detail the basis for indemnification with respect to
such Third Party Claim. Buyer shall have the right in its sole discretion to
conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim; _provided, that_ ,
Buyer will first seek the Securityholder Representatives consent to settle a
claim solely for monetary Losses (other than a claim by a Governmental
Authority), which shall not be withheld, conditioned or delayed unreasonably
and in the event any claim is settled without the written consent of the
Securityholder Representative, such settlement shall not be determinative of
the existence of an indemnifiable claim or the amount of Losses (if any) that
a Buyer Indemnified Person may be entitled to as a result of such Third Party
Claim. In the event that the Securityholder Representative has consented in
writing to any such settlement, the Securityholders shall

 



-64- 

    

 have no power or authority to object to the amount of any Third Party Claim
payable by Buyer pursuant to such settlement. If the Third Party Claim may
result in a claim for indemnification, the Securityholder Representative, on
behalf of the Securityholders, shall be entitled, at the Securityholders
expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of
such Third Party Claim.

 

(ii) If any Seller Indemnified Person desires to seek indemnification with
respect to a Third Party Claim pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _ IX_, the
Securityholder Representative shall notify Buyer in writing of such claim,
describing in reasonable detail the basis for indemnification with respect to
such Third Party Claim. Such Seller Indemnified Person shall have the right
in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such
claim; _provided, that_ , in the event that any claim is settled without the
written consent of Buyer, such settlement shall not be determinative of the
existence of an indemnifiable claim or the amount of Losses (if any) that such
Seller Indemnified Person may be entitled to as a result of such Third Party
Claim. In the event that Buyer has consented in writing to any such
settlement, Buyer shall have no power or authority to object to the amount of
any Third Party Claim payable by such Seller Indemnified Person pursuant to
such settlement. If the Third Party Claim may result in a claim for
indemnification, Buyer shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in,
but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim.

9.5  _Securityholder_ _Representative_.

(a) By virtue of executing this Agreement by each of the Securityholders
and without any further action of any of the Securityholders or the Company,
each of the Securityholders shall be deemed to have agreed to irrevocably
appoint Fortis Advisors LLC as such Securityholders true, exclusive, and
lawful agent and attorney-in-fact, as the Securityholder Representative for
and on behalf of the Securityholders, to take all actions under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Securityholder Representative
Engagement Agreement that are to be taken by the Securityholder
Representative, including to amend this Agreement, to waive any provision of
this Agreement, to take actions necessary to give effect to the
Acquisition, to negotiate payments due pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ IX_,
to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize payment to any
Buyer Indemnified Person from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in satisfaction of
claims by any Buyer Indemnified Person, to authorize payment to Buyer from
the Adjustment Escrow Fund, to object to such payments, to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders
of courts with respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect
to, any other claim by any Buyer Indemnified Person against any of the
Securityholders or by any of the Securityholders against any
Buyer Indemnified Person or any dispute between any Buyer Indemnified Person
and any of the Securityholders, in each case relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and to take all other actions
that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Securityholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)
specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
the Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement, in each case subject
to the limitation set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ or otherwise in this
Agreement and in accordance with the terms hereof, and Fortis Advisors LLC
hereby accepts such appointment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Securityholder Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the
Securityholders, except as expressly provided herein, in the Escrow Agreement
and in the Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement, and for
purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the Securityholder
Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Company
Disclosure Schedule. The Securityholder Representatives appointment shall
survive the death, incapacity, adjudication of incompetence or insanity, or
dissolution or bankruptcy, of any Securityholder. Such agency may be changed
by the Securityholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30)
days prior written notice to Buyer; _provided, however_ , that the
Securityholder Representative may not be removed unless Securityholders
representing the holders of at least a two-thirds interest of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted
agent. The immunities and rights to

 



-65- 

    

 indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Securityholder Representative or any member of the Advisory Group and the
Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. In
the event of a vacancy in the position of Securityholder Representative, the
role shall be temporarily filled by the Securityholders holding a majority in
interest of the Indemnity Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of
the Securityholder Representative. Notices or communications to or from the
Securityholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from all the
Securityholders. The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification granted
to the Securityholder Representative _Group_ hereunder: (i) are coupled with
an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence,
bankruptcy or liquidation of any Securityholder and shall be binding on any
successor thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by
any Securityholder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in
the Indemnity Escrow Fund or Additional Consideration. All actions taken by
the Securityholder Representative under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
or the Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement shall be binding
upon each Securityholder and such Securityholders successors as if expressly
confirmed and ratified in writing by such Seller, and all defenses which may
be available to any Securityholder to contest, negate or disaffirm the action
of the Securityholder Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or the Securityholder Representative Engagement
Agreement are waived.

(b) Each of the Securityholders represents and warrants to Buyer and to the
Escrow Agent that the Securityholder Representative has the irrevocable,
absolute and unconditional right, power and authority (i) to bind such
Securityholder pursuant to terms of this Agreement, (ii) to give and receive
directions and notices hereunder on behalf of such Securityholder and (iii)
to make all determinations on behalf of such Securityholder that may be
required or that it deems appropriate under this Agreement; in each case in
its capacity as the Securityholder Representative hereunder, all in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.

(c) Until notified in writing by the Securityholder Representative that it
has resigned, or that it has been removed by the requisite majority in
interest of the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to the term of clause (a)
above, Buyer and the Escrow Agent may rely conclusively and act upon
the directions, instructions and notices of the Securityholder Representative
named above and, thereafter, upon the directions, instructions and notices of
any successor named in a writing executed by the requisite majority-in-
interest of the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to the term of clause (a)
above, filed with the Escrow Agent or a successor appointed by a court of
competent jurisdiction, which actions (or failures to act), directions,
instructions and notices shall be conclusive and binding on all the
Securityholders, in each case subject to the limitation set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.5_ or otherwise in this Agreement, and Buyer shall not have
any liability of any kind or nature to any Securityholders in reliance
thereon.

(d) Without derogating from the generality of the above, the Securityholders
each hereby authorize the Securityholder Representative to, in each case
subject to the limitation set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ or otherwise
in this Agreement:

 

(i) Receive all notices or documents given or to be given to the
Securityholders pursuant hereto or in connection herewith and to receive
and accept service of legal process and file pleadings on behalf of the
Securityholders in connection with any suit or proceeding arising under this
Agreement;

 

(ii) Engage counsel, and such accountants and other advisors and incur such
other expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement as the Securityholder Representative may in its
sole discretion deem appropriate; and

 



-66- 

    

(iii) Take such action as the Securityholder Representative may in its sole
discretion deem appropriate in respect of: (A) waiving any inaccuracies in
the representations or warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement or in
any document delivered by Buyer pursuant hereto; (B) taking such other action
as the Securityholder Representative is authorized to take under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Securityholder Representative
Engagement Agreement; (C) receiving all documents or certificates and making
all determinations, in its capacity as Securityholder Representative,
required under this Agreement; and (D) all such actions as may be necessary to
carry out any of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement in its
capacity as Securityholder Representative, including to prosecute or defend
(or decline to do so) in the Securityholder Representatives discretion all
indemnification disputes (including hiring counsel and other litigation
assistance), and any claims for which indemnification is sought pursuant
to this _Article_ __ _ IX_; _provided_ , that the Securityholder
Representative shall have no authority to consent to the provision of any non-
monetary damages by Securityholders, without their written consent, and any
waiver of any obligation of Buyer;

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the event of any claims for which
indemnification is sought pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ IX_ against a
specific Securityholder, the Securityholder Representative shall notify such
Securityholder of such claim, promptly upon receipt of the
applicable Officers Certificate from Buyer Indemnified Person and such
Securityholder __ will have the right to control the defense of the Third
Party Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to Buyer instead of the
Securityholder Representative on the terms set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.4(f)_, (ii) the liability of any Securityholder shall be subject to the
limitation set forth in this Agreement and the Securityholder Representative
shall have no authority to consent to or authorize the amendment of such
limitations, without the written consent of such Securityholder and (iii) the
Securityholder Representative shall have no authority to consent to or
authorize the allocation of the Acquisition Consideration not in accordance
with the Consideration Spreadsheet (or the Updated Consideration Spreadsheet,
if delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_), without the written consent
of all Securityholders.

 

(f) Certain Securityholders have entered into an engagement agreement (the "
_Securityholder_ _Representative Engagement Agreement_ ") with the
Securityholder Representative to provide direction to the Securityholder
Representative in connection with its services under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement
(such Securityholders, including their individual representatives,
collectively hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). Neither the
Securityholder Representative nor its members, managers, directors, officers,
contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory Group
(collectively, the " _Securityholder_ _Representative Group_ "), shall be
liable to any Securityholder for any action or failure to act in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Securityholder Representatives
responsibilities hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under the
Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement, unless and only to the
extent such action or failure to act constitutes gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Securityholders shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, against such Securityholders ratable share, based
on the Pro Rata Portion, the Securityholder Representative Group from and
against any and all Losses, claims, judgments, fines or amounts paid in
settlement arising out of or in connection with the Securityholder
Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement in its
capacity as Securityholder Representative, or otherwise in connection with
acting as the Securityholder Representative, in each case as such Losses are
incurred, including the fees and expenses of any legal counsel, accountants,
auditors and other advisors retained by the Securityholder Representative in
its capacity as Securityholder Representative in connection with this
Agreement, costs of other skilled professionals and in connection with
seeking recovery from insurers (collectively, the " _Securityholder_
_Representative Expenses_ "). Any such Securityholder Representative Expenses
shall be recovered (i) first from any distribution of the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, but only if and when required to be distributed to the Securityholders,
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement at the time of distribution in 

 



-67- 

    

 accordance with written instructions delivered by the Securityholder
Representative to the Escrow Agent, and (ii) secondly, directly from the
Securityholders severally and not jointly and in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portion. The Securityholders acknowledge that the
Securityholder Representative shall not be required to expend or risk its own
funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or
performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Securityholder Representative
Engagement Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Furthermore, the Securityholder Representative shall not be required to take
any action unless the Securityholder Representative has been provided with
funds, security or indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to
protect the Securityholder Representative against the costs, expenses and
liabilities which may be incurred by the Securityholder Representative in
performing such actions.

(g) All of the Securityholder Representative Expenses incurred by the
Securityholder Representative in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement shall be
payable by the Securityholders, initially out of the Securityholder
Representatives Reserve Fund. Any of the Securityholder Representative
Expenses incurred by the Securityholder Representative in connection with this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Securityholder Representative
Engagement Agreement in excess of the Securityholder Representatives Reserve
Fund shall be reimbursed to the Securityholder Representative by the
Securityholders, severally and not jointly and in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portion. The Securityholder Representatives Reserve Fund
shall be held by the Securityholder Representative in a segregated client
account and shall be used (i) for the purposes of paying directly or
reimbursing the Securityholder Representative for any Securityholder
Representative Expenses incurred pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement, or (ii)
as otherwise determined by the Advisory Group. The Securityholder
Representative is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or
advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal
of the Securityholder Representatives Reserve Fund other than as a result of
its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Securityholder Representative
is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection
with the Securityholder Representatives Reserve Fund and has no
Tax reporting or income distribution obligations. The Securityholders will
not receive any interest on the Securityholder Representatives Reserve Fund
and assign to the Securityholder Representative any such interest. Subject to
Advisory Group approval, the Securityholder Representative may contribute
funds to the Securityholder Representatives Reserve Fund from any
consideration otherwise distributable to the Securityholders. Any remaining
funds in the Securityholder Representatives Reserve Fund not used by the
Securityholder Representative will be paid to the Securityholders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions of the Acquisition
Consideration. The Securityholder Representative shall have the right to
retain the Securityholder Representatives Reserve Fund for as long as the
Securityholder Representative deems necessary to discharge its duties.

 

(h) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Securityholder Representative
Group shall not be liable to the Securityholders, the Company, Buyer and\\\or
any other party, for any act done or omitted hereunder in its capacity as the
Securityholder Representative, unless caused by its willful misconduct. In all
questions arising in respect of any matter arising hereunder,
the Securityholder Representative may rely on the advice of counsel and any
action based upon such reliance shall relieve the Securityholder
Representative of any Liabilities hereunder. The Securityholder Representative
shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the Consideration Spreadsheet, (ii) rely
upon any signature believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume
that a signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable
Securityholder or other party.

(i) The Securityholder Representative acknowledges and agrees with Buyer and
the Company that the Securityholder Representative shall not receive and
shall not be entitled to receive any compensation from Buyer and shall not
receive any compensation from the Company after the Closing.

9.6 _Additional Limitations on Indemnification; Remedy_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Party nor any of
its Affiliates shall have liability under this  _Article_ __ _ IX_ for any
exemplary, special or punitive damages whatsoever or any Losses that were not
the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the relevant act, omission or
breach, and, in each case, the Losses indemnifiable hereunder shall not
include such damages unless such Losses are required to be paid in connection
with a Third Party Claim.

(b) Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, for purposes of determining the
amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under this _Article_ __ _
IX_, the amount of such Losses will be determined net of (i) any amounts taken
into account as liabilities or reserves in the calculation of the Accounts
Payable of the Company as of the Closing, or otherwise taken into account in
the calculation of the Acquisition Consideration (or any component thereof)
and (ii) any amounts actually recovered by a Buyer Indemnified Person under
insurance policies and\\\or any other third party or source with respect to
such Losses (net of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
collecting such amounts) (" _Recovered Proceeds_ "). The Buyer Indemnified
Persons will, and will cause their Affiliates to, and the Securityholders
will, and will cause the Companys pre-Closing managers and officers to, use
good faith commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Recovered Proceeds
from the "tail" director and officer liability insurance and product
liability insurance obtained by the Company in connection with the Closing.

 

(c) Neither a Buyer Indemnified Person nor a Seller Indemnified Person shall
be entitled to recover the identical Loss twice; _provided_ , that this
_Section_ __ _ 9.6(c)_ shall not limit a Party from recovering any additional
Losses incurred by such Party arising from the same facts or a similar set of
facts, even if such additional Losses are of the same general character as
the Losses previously recovered.

(d) Buyer and the Securityholders acknowledge and agree that they are subject
to the duty to mitigate Losses as determined under Delaware Law.

9.7 _Purchase Price Adjustments_. Amounts paid to or on behalf of any
person as indemnification under this Agreement shall be treated for all
purposes as adjustments to the Acquisition Consideration, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law.

 

9.8 _Sole Remedy_. From and following the Closing, the Parties agree that,
except for (a) the availability of injunctive or other equitable relief and
(b) the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.1_, the rights to indemnification
under this _Article_ __ _ IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy that any
Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person will have in connection
with the transactions under this Agreement.

9.9 _Termination_.

 

(a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

 

(i) with the mutual written consent of each of the Company and Buyer;

 

(ii) by Buyer or the Company if the Closing has not been consummated by the
date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time, provided
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (ii) shall
not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation
hereunder has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing
to be consummated by such date;

 



-69- 

    

(iii) by the Company, if Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement or if any of
Buyers representations and warranties in this Agreement are inaccurate, which
breach, failure to perform, or inaccuracy (A) would give rise, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, to the failure of a condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and (B) has not been or is incapable of being cured by
Buyer prior to the thirtieth (30th) calendar day after its receipt of written
notice thereof from the Company;

(iv) by Buyer, if the Company or the Securityholders shall have breached or
failed to perform any of their respective covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement or if any of the Companys or the Securityholders
respective representations and warranties in this Agreement are inaccurate,
which breach, failure to perform, or inaccuracy (A) would give rise, if
occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, to the failure of a condition set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and (B) has not been or is incapable of being
cured by the Company prior to the thirtieth (30th) calendar day after its
receipt of written notice thereof from Buyer; or

(v) by either the Company or Buyer, if (A) any Governmental Authority shall
have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is then in effect and which has the
effect of making the Acquisition illegal or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the Acquisition; or (B) any temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing
the consummation of the Acquisition shall then be in effect, or any
proceeding brought by any Governmental Authority, seeking any of the foregoing
shall be then threatened or pending (a " _Governmental Authority Restriction_
").

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated as described in _Section_ __ _ 9.9(a)_,
this Agreement shall become void and of no further force or effect, except
for the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ and _Article_ __ _ XI_ _;
provided_ , that such termination will not affect any right or remedy that
accrued under this Agreement or under applicable Law prior to or on account
of such termination, and the provisions of this Agreement shall survive such
termination to the extent required so that each Party may enforce all rights
and remedies available to such Party hereunder or under applicable Law in
respect of such termination and so that any Party responsible for a breach of
its obligations hereunder prior to termination shall remain liable for the
consequences thereof.
