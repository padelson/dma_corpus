8.2 Claims under the Recovery Matters



To the extent that a Jacobs Indemnified Party suffers or incurs any Loss in
respect of a

Recovery Matter, including where:



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

a Jacobs Indemnified Party suffers or incurs any Loss because an Adjustment
Statement was untrue, inaccurate or misleading on the date given (or deemed
given); or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

a Jacobs Indemnified Party suffers or incurs any Loss arising out of or in
connection with a matter described in clause 8.1(b), 

 

and that Claim succeeds or is admitted by a Sellers\' Representative in
accordance with clause 9 then, subject to the limitations in clauses 8.3 and
8.4, the Additional Scheme Consideration will be reduced by any Loss suffered
or incurred by the Jacobs Indemnified Parties in connection with such Claim
and the relevant amounts (Released Amounts) will be released from the Escrow
Account to Jacobs in accordance with clause 9 and the terms of this Agreement
generally. The Released Amounts will be treated as a reduction in the SKMH
Scheme Consideration.



8.3 Monetary and time limitations on Claims



Any Claim made by Jacobs under this Agreement is subject to the limitations
and qualifications set out in this clause 8.3 and clauses 8.4, 8.5, 8.6 and 9:



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

timing: Jacobs must give written notice to the Sellers' Representatives of the
nature of the Claim in accordance with clause 9.1 on or before the Second
Adjustment Date; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

maximum: save in respect of Claims related to fraud or wilful misconduct or
Title Adjustment Statements that are untrue, inaccurate or misleading, the
maximum aggregate amount which may be released to Jacobs from the Escrow Account under
this Agreement in respect of all Claims is the Additional Scheme
Consideration;



| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

proportionate share: for the avoidance of doubt, where Jacobs has a Claim for
a Title Adjustment Statement that is untrue, inaccurate or misleading, then
(without prejudice to any other Claims Jacobs may have against the Relevant
Seller under this Agreement) the maximum aggregate amount which may be
released from the Escrow Account to Jacobs in respect of such a Claim in
accordance with clauses 9 is the Relevant Seller\'s Proportionate Share of the
Additional Scheme Consideration; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

monetary thresholds: save in respect of a Claim related to (i) fraud or wilful
misconduct, (ii) a Title Adjustment Statement which is untrue, inaccurate or
misleading, (iii) Leakage or (iv) clause 8.1(b)(6)(D), Jacobs will not be
entitled to recover on a Claim under this Agreement unless: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

the Loss under such Claim exceeds $2,000,000, in which case, Jacobs will be
entitled to recover the full amount of such Loss, subject to the limitations
in clause 8.3(d)(2); and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

the aggregate Losses under all Claims exceed $12,000,000, in which case,
Jacobs will be entitled to recover the amount of such Losses in excess of
$12,000,000. 

 

For the avoidance of doubt, once the threshold set forth in clause 8.3(d)(2)
has been satisfied, such threshold will no longer apply and all Losses in
excess of such threshold shall thereafter be recoverable by Jacobs, subject to
the limitations set forth in clause 8.3(d)(1). Any and all Claims in respect
of the Accounts Receivable Guarantee will be treated as a single Claim for
purposes of this clause 8.3(d).



| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

calculation of thresholds: where it is necessary to determine whether a
monetary limit or threshold set out in this clause 8.3 has been reached or
exceeded and the value of the relevant Claim (or any part of the relevant
Claim) is expressed in a currency other than Australian dollars, the value of
each such Claim shall be translated into Australian dollars at the mid-market
A$ exchange rate as quoted by Bloomberg on the date of receipt by the
Sellers\' Representatives of written notification from Jacobs in accordance
with clause 9.1 (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the Business Day
immediately preceding such day). 

 

8.4 Further limitation



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Subject to clauses 8.4(b), 8.4(c) and 8.4(d), Jacobs shall not be entitled to
damages or any other payment in respect of a Claim (including from the Escrow
Account) to the extent that it relates to the Recovery Matters if: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Disclosure Letter: the matters giving rise to the Claim were fairly and
accurately disclosed in the Disclosure Letter (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, the contents of the Data Site shall not be deemed to be so disclosed
save to the extent they are fairly and accurately disclosed in, or
incorporated by reference with specificity into, the Disclosure Letter);

change in law: the Claim is increased as a result of: 

 

|

Implementation Date); or



a change in the judicial interpretation of any Law following the

Implementation Date;

---|--- 

(3)

|

provision: the Loss in respect of the Claim has been expressly included as a
specifically identifiable (and not general) provision, allowance, reserve or

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

at the express written direction of Jacobs after the Operative Date;

---|--- 

(5)

|

change in accounting policy: the Claim would not have arisen but for a change

Implementation Date; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(6)

|

loss recovered from third party: the Claim has been paid in immediately
available funds by a third party, including payment under an Insurance Policy; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(7)

|

insured claim: where Jacobs is entitled to bring a claim under an Insurance
Policy in respect of the underlying facts and circumstances giving rise to the
Claim, Jacobs does not use reasonable endeavours to first pursue its right of
recovery under such Insurance Policy in accordance with clause 9; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(8)

|

Insurance Policy: Jacobs or any Representative of Jacobs takes any action
(including by way of omission) that renders any Insurance Policy invalid or
incapable of responding to the Claim;

(d)

|

The limitation in clause 8.4(a)(4)(A) (Pre-Implementation Date Actions, clause
(A)) does not apply to the Recovery Matters in clause 8.1(b)(6) (Tax Matters). 

 

8.5 Remedies



Save in respect of fraud or wilful misconduct and Claims in respect the Title
Adjustment Statements, Jacobs' sole remedy against the Sellers under this
Agreement is through an Adjustment in accordance with (and subject to) this
Agreement and in no event is Jacobs entitled to rescind this Agreement or seek

| 
---|--- 

(1)

was not treated as an asset in the Locked Box Date Accounts; or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

does not arise from an Event occurring after Completion or as a result of any

9. Conduct of Claims



9.1 Notification and pursuit of claims



If any Jacobs Specified Person becomes aware of any circumstances which
constitute or are reasonably likely (whether alone or with any other
circumstances or with the passage of time) to constitute a Claim by Jacobs for
Leakage, under the Accounts Receivable Guarantee or for the Recovery Matters,
Jacobs must (and, where applicable, must cause each member of the Jacobs Group
to):



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

notice: no later than 60 Business Days after becoming aware of such
circumstances, give the Sellers\' Representatives notice of the Claim, setting
out in a reasonable level of detail the circumstances as then known to the
Jacobs Group (including the quantum, or estimated quantum (being an amount
estimated by Jacobs reasonably and in good faith), of any alleged Claim) and
whether it is in respect (i) Leakage, (ii) the Accounts Receivable Guarantee,
(iii) a specific Adjustment Statement or (iv) a specific Recovery Matter
(Notice of Claim) and if on account of (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, provide
details of such specific Account Receivable, Adjustment Statement or Recovery
Matter, as the case may be. The Notice of Claim must specify whether or not
Jacobs believes that the Loss in respect of the Claim is capable of being
recovered under an Insurance Policy and the reasons for such belief. The
Notice of Claim must be given irrespective of whether or not Jacobs forms the
view that the Loss in respect of a Claim is capable of being recovered under
an Insurance Policy. Jacobs must also, on an on-going basis, keep the Sellers'
Representatives reasonably informed of all material developments in relation
to the matter. If a Notice of Claim is not given by Jacobs within the 60
Business Day period referred to in this clause 9.1(a), Jacobs shall not be
prevented from bringing such a Claim, nor shall it extinguish the liability of
the Sellers in respect of such a Claim but rather it shall be taken into
account in calculating the liability of the Sellers in respect of the matter
in question in that to the extent that such liability was increased as a
result of the failure to give notice in accordance with this clause 9.1(a)
that increase in liability is to be disregarded; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

access: without prejudice to the validity of any Claim, give the Sellers\'
Representatives and their advisers reasonable access to: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

the employees of the SKM Group; and 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

the documents, records and accounts of the SKM Group, 

 

during normal business hours (and permit the Sellers\' Representatives and
their advisers to take copies of any documents, records or accounts) to enable
the Sellers\' Representatives and their advisers to obtain information
relating to the Claim or potential Claim;



| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

notification of insurers: where Jacobs believes that the relevant insured
party may be entitled to recover for such Claim under an Insurance Policy,
promptly notify the relevant insurer of the Claim and the matters giving rise
to the Claim, in accordance with the terms of the relevant Insurance Policy; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

information sharing: where Jacobs or the relevant insured party may be
entitled to recover for such Claim under an Insurance Policy, promptly provide
the Sellers\' Representatives with all correspondence which it has with any
insurer in respect of any Insurance Policy and keep the Sellers\'
Representatives apprised of any material discussions it has with any relevant
insurer in respect of such Claim. The Sellers\' Representatives and their
advisers will be entitled to attend and participate in any such discussions; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

reasonable endeavours: where Jacobs or the relevant insured party may be
entitled to recover for such Claim under an Insurance Policy, use all
reasonable endeavours to recover to the fullest extent possible under that
Insurance Policy; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

legal opinion: where Jacobs or the relevant insured party may be entitled to
recover for such Claim under an Insurance Policy, if the relevant insurer
gives Jacobs notice that the applicable Insurance Policy will not respond to
the relevant matter or Claim, then Jacobs and the Sellers\' Representatives
will jointly select and brief appropriately experienced senior counsel (the
identity of whom must be jointly agreed by Jacobs and the Sellers\'
Representatives) to provide a written opinion about whether there are any
reasonable grounds on which the insurer\'s position in respect of denying
cover may be challenged and if so, recommendations about the steps that should
be taken in pursuing that claim (Legal Opinion). The cost of obtaining that
advice will be borne equally by Jacobs and the Sellers\' Representatives; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

pursuit of Claim under Insurance Policy: if the Legal Opinion concludes that
it is more likely than not that the insurer\'s position in denying cover could
successfully be challenged, Jacobs must continue to use reasonable endeavours
to ensure the relevant Insurance Policy responds to the claim and implement
the steps recommended by senior counsel that provided the Legal Opinion
(including commencing litigation against the relevant insurer if, in the
opinion of the senior counsel, it is more likely than not that Jacobs would be
successful in such litigation) provided that if the claim under the Insurance
Policy remains unresolved by the First Adjustment Date or the Second
Adjustment Date (as the case may be), then the quantum (or estimated quantum)
of any Claims under the Notice of Claim shall be included in the First
Unresolved Claims Quantum or Second Unresolved Claims Quantum (as the case may
be). The Sellers\' Representatives must also implement the steps recommended
by the senior counsel that provided the Legal Opinion, if required to do so; 

 | 
---|--- 

(h)

|

pursuit of Claim under Additional Scheme Consideration: if the Legal Opinion
concludes that it is more likely than not that the insurer\'s position in
denying cover could not successfully be challenged, then Jacobs must serve a
Notice of Claim on the Sellers\' Representatives in respect of such Claim
specifying that the Claim is not capable of being recovered by an Insurance
Policy and the provisions of this clause 9 shall apply except for the
provisions of clauses 9.1(c) through 9.1(g). If the Notice of Claim served by
Jacobs under this clause 9.1(h) is given before the First Adjustment Date or
before the Second Adjustment Date (as the case may be) and the Claim remains
unresolved by either of those dates, then the quantum (or estimated quantum)
of any Claims under the Notice of Claim shall be included in the First
Unresolved Claims Quantum or Second Unresolved Claims Quantum (as the case may
be); and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Government Agency: where the Loss in respect of the Notice of Claim arises
from a fine, criminal sanction or penalty (whether actual or prospective)
imposed by a Government Agency, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
promptly provide the Sellers\' Representatives with copies of all
correspondence which it has with such Government Agency and keep the Sellers\'
Representatives apprised of any material discussions it has with such
Government Agency in respect of such Claim. Subject to privilege,
confidentiality and approval of the Government Agency, the Sellers\'
Representatives and the Sellers' Representatives' advisers will be entitled to
attend and participate in any such discussions. 

 

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of clauses 9.1(c) through 9.1(i)
shall not apply to Claims for Leakage or under the Accounts Receivable
Guarantee.



9.2 Notice of dispute



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

If the Sellers\' Representatives dispute a Notice of Claim, they may issue a
notice (Notice of Dispute) to Jacobs and the Escrow Agent specifying full
details of why they dispute the Notice of Claim and the monetary amount (if
any) admitted by the Sellers\' Representatives as being owing to Jacobs. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers\' Representatives will not be required to,
and will not, issue a Notice of Dispute where the Loss in respect of a Claim
is capable of recovery under an Insurance Policy and the Claim has been
admitted by the relevant insurer in respect of such Loss or where a Claim has
been Finally Determined. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

If no Notice of Dispute is received by Jacobs and the Escrow Agent within 60
Business Days of receipt by the Sellers\' Representatives of the relevant
Notice of Claim (or where the Notice of Claim indicates that Jacobs believes
that the Claim is capable of being recovered under an Insurance Policy, within
60 Business Days after Jacobs issues a Notice of Claim under clause 9.1(h))
the Sellers\' Representatives are to be taken to have agreed with the Claim by
Jacobs set out in the Notice of Claim and clause 9.3 applies. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

If a Notice of Dispute is received by Jacobs and the Escrow Agent within 60
Business Days of receipt by the Sellers\' Representatives of the relevant
Notice of Claim (or where the Notice of Claim indicates that Jacobs believes
that the Claim is capable of being recovered under an Insurance Policy),
within 60 Business Days after Jacobs issues a Notice of Claim under clause
9.1(h): 

 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

which admits a lesser amount than was claimed by Jacobs in the Notice of
Claim, clause 9.4 applies; or 

 | 
---|--- 

(2)

|

which disputes the whole of the amount claimed by Jacobs in the Notice of
Claim, clause 9.5 applies, then the Sellers\' Representatives or Jacobs may
initiate proceedings pursuant to clause 13 to resolve the extent to which
Jacobs is entitled to have amounts released to it from the Additional Scheme
Consideration in respect of such Claims. 

 

9.3 Release



(a) After 30 Business Days have elapsed from Jacobs issuing a Notice of Claim
under clause 9.1(a) (or where the Notice of Claim indicates that Jacobs
believes it is entitled to recover such Claim under an Insurance Policy, after
30 Business Days have elapsed from Jacobs issuing a Notice of Claim under
clause 9.1(h)) Jacobs may issue, in accordance with clause 9.6, a notice
(Release Notice) to the Escrow Agent and the Sellers\' Representatives
requesting the release of the Additional Scheme Consideration to no greater
extent than the quantum (or estimated quantum) of the Claim or Claims referred
to in that Notice of Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, Jacobs cannot issue a
Release Notice where Jacobs is entitled to recover the Loss in respect of a
Claim under an Insurance Policy and such Claim is admitted by the relevant
insurer in respect of such Loss unless the amount of the Claim that has been
admitted by the relevant insurer is less than the full amount of the Loss.



(b) If:



| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

the Escrow Agent and the Sellers\' Representatives receive Release Notice; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

the Escrow Agent and Jacobs have not received a Notice of Dispute within 60
Business Days of receipt by the Sellers\' Representatives of the relevant
Notice of Claim (or where the Notice of Claim indicates that Jacobs believes
that the Claim is capable of being recovered under an Insurance Policy),
within 60 Business Days after Jacobs issues a Notice of Claim under clause
9.1(h), 

 



Jacobs and the Sellers\' Representatives must deliver a Joint Direction to the
Escrow Agent instructing the agent to withdraw the amount specified in the
Release Notice from the Escrow Account and pay that amount to Jacobs in
immediately available funds.



9.4 Lesser Amount Disputed



If:



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the Escrow Agent and the Sellers\' Representatives receive a Release Notice in
accordance with clause 9.3; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the Escrow Agent and Jacobs receive a Notice of Dispute in accordance with
clause 9.2(c)(1), then the Sellers\' Representatives and Jacobs must: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

deliver a Joint Direction to the Escrow Agent instructing the agent to
withdraw the amount specified in the Notice of Dispute as owing to Jacobs from
the Escrow Account and pay that amount to Jacobs in immediately available
funds; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

ensure that the Escrow Agent deals with the amount equal to the difference
between the amount specified in the Release Notice and the amount specified in the Notice of Dispute once the portion of the Claim
subject to the Notice of Dispute has been Finally Determined.



9.5 Disputed claim



If:



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the Escrow Agent and the Sellers\' Representatives receive a Release Notice in
accordance with clause 9.3; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the Escrow Agent and Jacobs receive a Notice of Dispute in accordance with
clause 9.2(c)(2), 

 

the Sellers\' Representatives and Jacobs must ensure that the Escrow Agent
deals with the amount specified in the Release Notice in accordance with the
Finally Determined Claim.



9.6 Delivery of Release Notice



Any Release Notice must be delivered to both the Sellers\' Representatives and
the

Escrow Agent.



9.7 Conduct of Third Party Claims



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Following receipt of a Notice of Claim which involves a Third Party Claim,
Jacobs shall: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

as soon as practicable notify the Sellers\' Representatives in writing; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

promptly give such information and access to personnel, premises, chattels,
documents and records as the Sellers\' Representatives may reasonably request; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

subject to clause 9.7(a)(4) below, be entitled, in its absolute discretion, to
take such action as it shall deem necessary to avoid, dispute, deny, defend,
resist, appeal, compromise or contest such Third Party Claims or liability
(including, without limitation, making counterclaims or other claims against
third parties); 

 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

10 Business Days before making any settlement or compromise of a Third Party
Claim which has been notified to the Sellers\' Representatives which is in
respect of an amount in excess of $2,000,000, seek the prior written consent
of the Sellers\' Representatives (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) in respect of such settlement or compromise. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

For the purposes of clause 9.7(a)(4), where the Third Party Claim relates to a
Tax Assessment and the Sellers\' Representatives have withheld or delayed
giving consent, consent shall be deemed to have been unreasonably withheld or
delayed in (but not limited to) the following circumstances: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

where such Third Party Claim is likely to affect materially adversely either
the future liability of the member of SKM Group concerned, or any other member
of the Jacobs Group, to Tax and/or the reputation or the business or financial
interests of any of them or of any person connected with any of them (and for
the purposes of this clause (A) only, a future liability to Tax is material if it is an
amount exceeding $500,000); or



| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

if Jacobs has obtained advice from an appropriate tax adviser of international
standing that any appeal against, or challenge to, such Third Party Claim is
more likely than not to fail. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Any failure by Jacobs and/or the Jacobs Group to comply with the provisions of
this clause 9.7 shall not prevent any claim by Jacobs or extinguish any
liability of the Sellers under the Recovery Matters but shall be taken into
account in calculating any such liability of the Sellers in that to the extent
that such liability was increased by such failure that increase in liability
is to be disregarded. 

 

9.8 Escrow Agent\'s fees

the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Deed and must continue to pay
such fees until all amounts held in the Escrow Account have been released by

|

Jacobs must ensure that every material pre-lmplementation Tax Return relating
to a member of the SKM Group that is lodged after the Implementation Date: 

 

|

|

is delivered to the Sellers\' Representatives in final draft form at least one
month before the relevant member of the SKM Group lodges that return; and

incorporates any amendments that Jacobs determines in its sole discretion are
reasonably requested (within 14 days of delivery in final draft form to the
Sellers' Representatives in accordance with clause 9.9(a)(1)(A)) by the
Sellers\' Representatives in respect of the treatment of transactions or
events that occurred prior to the Implementation Date and Jacobs is obliged to
give the Sellers\' Representatives and their advisers access that Jacobs
determines in its sole discretion is reasonable to the employees and records
of SKM Group that pertain to the period prior to the Implementation Date for
the purposes of reviewing any pre- lmplementation Tax Return; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

objection or appeal. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

if an amount payable under or in connection with this Agreement (whether by
way of reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise) is calculated by reference to an

reduced by the amount of any Input Tax Credit to which that party is entitled
in respect of that Amount Incurred; and

Disclosure Letter sets forth all (i) material professional indemnity or errors
and omissions or (ii) other claims in excess of $25,000 that have been made
