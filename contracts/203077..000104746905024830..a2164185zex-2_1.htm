required by law or the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>SEC</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") in connection with such increase in each case without the consent of
the Company. </FONT></P>

comparable foreign Governmental Entity including FDA's Quality System Regulation, 21 C.F.R. Part&nbsp;820; the Company does not have knowledge of any facts which furnish any reasonable basis for any
Form&nbsp;FDA-483 observations or regulatory or warning letters from the FDA, Section&nbsp;305 notices, or other similar communications from the FDA or comparable foreign entity; and
since April&nbsp;30, 1999, there have been no recalls, field notifications, alerts or seizures requested or threatened relating to the Company's products, except as set forth in Section&nbsp;3.8

which amount has been disclosed to Parent, on terms and conditions substantially similar to the existing D&amp;O Insurance. If the existing D&amp;O Insurance cannot be maintained, expires or is terminated or
