AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 15, 2005 (this " _Agreement_ "), is among St. Jude Medical, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (" _Parent_ "), Apollo Merger Corp., a Texas corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and Advanced Neuromodulation Systems, Inc., a Texas corporation (the " _Company_ ") (Sub and the Company being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Constituent Corporations_ "). 

  

    
RECITALS: 

  

 A. The respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Sub have each unanimously (i) determined that the Offer and the Merger (as such terms are defined herein), as contemplated by this Agreement are advisable to their respective corporations and shareholders, and (ii) approved the Offer and the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 B. To facilitate the consummation of the Merger between the Company and Sub, Parent and the Company have proposed the acquisition (pursuant to the Offer described in Section 1.1) of all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.05 per share, of the Company (the " _Shares_ "), together with the associated Company Rights (as hereafter defined), at a price of $61.25 in cash per Share (such price or such higher price per Share as may be paid in the Offer, being referred to herein as the " _Offer Price_ "); and 

  

 C. After the acquisition of the Shares described in the preceding clause, and pursuant to the plan specified in this Agreement, Sub will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously recommended that the Merger be approved by the shareholders of the Company if such approval is required by the Texas Business Corporation Act (the " _TBCA_ "). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 
THE OFFER AND THE MERGER 

  

 Section 1.1. _ The Offer._ 

  

  

 (a) Provided this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, as promptly as practicable and in any event within seven business days after the date hereof, Parent or Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, as the first step in completing the Merger, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act"_ )), an offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the issued and outstanding Shares, together with the associated rights issued pursuant to the Company\'s Rights Plan (as defined herein) (the " _Company Rights_ ") for the Offer Price, subject to the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto; _provided, however_ , that Parent may designate itself or another wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent as the bidder (within the meaning of Rule 14d-1(g)(2) under the Exchange Act) in the Offer, in which case reference herein to Sub shall be deemed to apply to Parent or such Subsidiary, as appropriate. Except where the context otherwise requires, all references herein to Shares or the Company\'s common stock shall include the associated Company Rights. The Company shall not tender Shares held by it or by any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Offer. Parent or Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, on the terms and subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Offer set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto, accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered and not validly withdrawn within three business days of the Acceptance Date. The obligations of Parent or Sub to consummate the Offer and to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares validly tendered on or prior to the expiration of the Offer and not validly withdrawn shall be subject only to the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto. 

  

 (b) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") containing the terms set forth in this Agreement and the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto     

  
  

and providing for an initial expiration date (as may be extended as provided
in this clause (b), the " _Expiration Date_ ") of twenty business days (as
defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) from the date of
commencement (including the date of commencement) of the Offer. Without the
prior written consent of the Company, Parent and Sub shall not, and Parent
shall cause Sub not to, decrease the Offer Price, change the form of
consideration to be paid, decrease the number of Shares sought, impose
conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in _Exhibit A_,
change or waive the Minimum Condition, or otherwise amend any other material
term or condition of the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Company, Parent or
Sub shall be entitled (and, if any condition set forth in clause (i), clause
(ii), or subclauses (a), (b), (c), or (d) of clause (iii), of _Exhibit A_
shall exist Parent or Sub shall be required in any case where it is
reasonably possible that such condition could be remedied by the Final Date
(as hereinafter defined)) to extend the Offer at any time for such
time periods that it reasonably believes are necessary, if at the initial
Expiration Date, or any extension thereof, any condition to the Offer is not
satisfied or waived. In no event shall Parent or Sub be required to extend
the Offer beyond the Final Date. In addition, if the Minimum Condition has
been met but less than 90% of the outstanding Shares on a fully-diluted basis
(as defined in _Exhibit A_) shall have been validly tendered pursuant to the
Offer and not validly withdrawn as of the scheduled or extended expiration
date, Parent or Sub may, without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer
after the acceptance of Shares thereunder for a further period of time, not to
exceed an aggregate of ten business days, by means of a subsequent offering
period under Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. In addition, the
Offer Price may be increased and the Offer may be extended to the
extent required by law or the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") in connection with such increase in each case
without the consent of the Company.

  

 (c) As soon as practicable after the date hereof and in any event within seven business days after the date hereof, Parent shall (i) file with the SEC, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer, which will comply in all material respects with the provisions of, and satisfy in all material respects the requirements of, such Schedule TO and all applicable federal securities laws, and will contain or incorporate by reference all or part of the form of the related letter of transmittal (such documents, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, collectively the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares to the extent required by applicable securities laws. On the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the holders of Shares, the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that neither Parent nor Sub is responsible for information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Offer Documents. The Company shall provide Parent and Sub all information reasonably requested by Parent or Sub for inclusion in the Offer Documents and any exhibits or annexes thereto. Parent and the Company each agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall be, or shall have become, false or misleading in any material respect. Parent agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. 

  

 (d) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to, the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents will be made by the Company, Parent or Sub, without providing the other party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. In addition, Parent shall, and shall cause Sub to, provide the Company and its counsel in writing with any comments that Parent, Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments and with 

  

      

  
  

copies of any written responses and telephonic notification of any verbal
responses by Parent, Sub or their counsel.

The Company represents and warrants that Article 13.03 of the TBCA does not prohibit the Offer, the Merger and transactions contemplated hereby. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of its Board of Directors described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 1.2(a). 

  

 (b) Concurrently with the commencement of the Offer or as promptly thereafter as practicable and in no case later than one day after the commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including the exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_"), which shall contain the recommendation referred to in clause (ii) of Section 1.2(a) hereof unless such recommendation has been withdrawn, or as such recommendation has been modified or amended, in each case in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Parent and Sub shall provide the Company all information reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 and any exhibits or annexes thereto. The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities laws and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the holders of Shares, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that the Company is not responsible for information supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company further shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, and shall mail such Schedule 14D-9 to holders of Shares promptly after commencement of the Offer, together with the initial mailing of the Offer to Purchase. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Sub, on the other hand, shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false and misleading in any material respect and the Company further shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall provide Parent, Sub and their counsel a 

  

      

  
  

reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 and any
correction or amendment thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. In
addition, the Company shall provide Parent, Sub and their counsel in writing
with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such
comments and with copies of any written responses and telephonic notification
of any verbal responses by the Company or its counsel.

  

 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent or Sub mailing labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of a recent date, and shall promptly furnish Parent or Sub with such additional information, including updated lists of shareholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and such other information and assistance as Parent or Sub or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the shareholders of the Company. Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and subject to the requirements of Applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall cause Sub and each of Sub\'s and Parent\'s respective affiliates, associates, employees, agents and advisors to, hold in confidence the information contained in any of such labels and lists and the additional information referred to in the preceding sentence, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement is terminated, shall upon request of the Company deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company all copies of such information then in its possession or control or the possession or control of its agents or representatives. 

  

  

 Section 1.3. _ Directors._ 

  

  

 (a) Concurrently with the purchase and payment for any Shares by Parent or Sub pursuant to the Offer as a result of which Parent or Sub and their affiliates own beneficially at least a majority of the then outstanding Shares, and from time to time thereafter as Shares are acquired by Sub, Parent or their respective affiliates, Sub shall be entitled to designate upon written notice to the Company for election such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of Directors of the Company as will give Parent or Sub, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, representation on the Board of Directors of the Company equal to that number of directors which equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence and including current directors serving as officers of the Company) and (ii) the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates (including for purposes of this Section 1.3 such Shares as are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, but excluding Shares held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) bears to the total number of Shares then issued and outstanding. At such times, if requested by Parent or Sub, and subject to Applicable Law and the rules of The Nasdaq National Market, the Company will use its best efforts to cause each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Board of Directors of each Subsidiary of the Company to include persons designated by Parent or Sub constituting the same percentage of each such committee and the Board of Directors of each Subsidiary of the Company as Parent\'s or Sub\'s designees are of the Board of Directors of the Company. 

  

 (b) Concurrently with the purchase and payment for any Shares by Parent or Sub pursuant to the Offer as a result of which Parent or Sub and their affiliates own beneficially at least a majority of the then outstanding Shares, the Company shall, upon request by Parent or Sub, promptly increase the size of the Board of Directors of the Company from seven to nine members (which the Company represents does not require shareholder approval) and exercise its best efforts to secure the resignations of such number of Directors as is necessary to enable Parent\'s or Sub\'s designees to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the terms of 

  

      

  
  

this Section 1.3 and, subject to Applicable Law, shall cause Sub\'s designees
to be so elected; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Parent\'s or Sub\'s
designees are elected to the Board of Directors of the Company, until the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have at least
four directors who are directors on the date hereof, three of whom are neither
officers of the Company nor designees, affiliates or associates (within the
meaning of the federal securities laws) of Parent or Sub prior to the date
hereof (one or more of such directors, the " _Independent Directors_ ");
_provided, further_ , that if less than three Independent Directors remain,
the remaining Independent Directors (if any) or if no Independent
Directors remain, the other directors, shall designate persons to fill the
vacancies who shall not be either officers of the Company or designees,
shareholders, affiliates or associates of Parent or Sub, and such persons
shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement;
_provided, further_ , so long as Parent and Sub collectively own a majority
of the Shares in no event shall Parent\'s designees be less than a majority of
the Board of Directions, and the Company shall take such action as Parent
shall request in order to give effect to the foregoing.

  

 (c) Subject to Applicable Law, the Company shall promptly take all action necessary pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 mailed to holders of Shares promptly after the commencement of the Offer (or an amendment thereof or an information statement pursuant to Rule 14f-1 if Parent or Sub has not theretofore designated directors) such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3. Parent and Sub will supply the Company and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, during the period after the election of directors designated by Parent or Sub pursuant to this Section 1.3 but prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, delegate to a committee of the Board of Directors of the Company comprised solely of the Independent Directors (the " _Committee_ "), the sole responsibility for (i) the amendment or termination of this Agreement (in either case in accordance with this Agreement) on behalf of the Company, (ii) the waiver of any of the Company\'s rights or remedies hereunder, (iii) the extension of the time for performance of Parent\'s or Sub\'s obligations hereunder, or (iv) the assertion or enforcement of the Company\'s rights under this Agreement. 

  

  

 Section 1.4. _ The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance with the TBCA, Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.5). Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in accordance with the TBCA. 

  

 Section 1.5. _ Effective Time._ Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date: (a) the Articles of Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), substantially in the form of either _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_ (as appropriate) _,_ shall be duly executed by the Company and Sub (to the extent required by the TBCA) and thereafter filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas, and (b) the parties shall make such other filings with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas as shall be necessary to effect the Merger. The Merger shall be effective upon the issuance of a certificate of merger by the Secretary of State of the State of Texas with respect to the Merger, or such later time as Parent and the Company may agree upon and as may be expressly and clearly set forth in the Articles of Merger. The time the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ". 

  

 Section 1.6. _ Closing of the Merger._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at a time and on a date (the " _Closing Date_ ") to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the 

        
  

second business day after satisfaction (or waiver) of the latest to occur of
the conditions set forth in Article VI except for such conditions which may
only be satisfied by delivery of documents or certificates at the Closing, at
the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 2100 McKinney Avenue, Dallas,
Texas, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by

 Section 1.11. _ Conversion of Securities._ As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of the Constituent Corporations: 

  

  

 (a) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Sub shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation outstanding immediately after the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) All Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company and any Shares owned by Parent or Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent, directly or indirectly, shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no capital stock of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, each then issued and outstanding Share (other than Dissenting Shares, as contemplated by Articles 5.12 and 5.13 of the TBCA, shares described in Section 1.11(b), and Restricted Shares described in Section 1.11(f)) shall immediately cease to be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and retired, shall cease to exist, and shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price (the " _Per Share Price_ ") to be paid in accordance with this Section 1.11(c), and Sections 1.12, and 1.13. At the Effective Time, each holder of Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such issued and outstanding Shares (other than Dissenting Shares, as contemplated by Articles 5.12 and 5.13 of the TBCA or Shares with respect to which dissenters rights have not been terminated, as contemplated by Articles 5.13 and 5.16 of the TBCA) (including, without limitation, the right to vote), except for the right to receive the Per Share Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, then the Per Share Price shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares. 

  

 (d) Effective as of the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option (as defined in Section 3.2), whether or not then exercisable, shall: 

    

 (i) with respect to the portion thereof that is vested as of the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Option and the applicable Company Stock Option Plan (as defined in Section 3.2), be cancelled in exchange for a single lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option as of the Effective Time and (B) the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the vested portion of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, less any applicable tax or other withholdings; and 

  

 (ii) with respect to the portion thereof that is unvested as of the Effective Time be assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase common stock of Parent, par 

   

      

   
  

value $0.01 per share ("Parent Common Stock"), in accordance with this
Section 1.11(d). Such unvested portion of any Company Stock Option so
converted shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions (including vesting schedule) as set forth in the applicable Company
Stock Option Plan and any individual agreement thereunder immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except that, as of the Effective Time, (A) each Company
Stock Option so converted shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of Shares that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounding down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock) and (B) the per share exercise
price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
Company Stock Option so converted shall be equal to the quotient determined
by dividing (x) the exercise price per Share at which such Company Stock
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) the
Exchange Ratio, rounding up to the nearest whole cent.

    

 (e) The "Exchange Ratio" shall mean a fraction, the numerator of which is the Per Share Price and the denominator of which is the average closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the ten trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the date on which the Effective Time occurs. 

  

 (f) Effective as of the Effective Time, each outstanding Share that is subject to repurchase by the Company or otherwise subject to a risk of forfeiture or other similar condition under the Company Stock Option Plans or any restricted stock purchase agreement (a " _Restricted Share_ "), and as to which such restrictions shall not have been eliminated at or prior to the Effective Time, shall be assumed by Parent and converted into a shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth below. Restricted Shares so converted shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting schedule and repurchase rights) as set forth in the applicable agreement governing such Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that, as of the Effective Time, Restricted Shares so converted shall thereafter be converted into that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of Restricted Shares held by each such Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounding down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock). The Company shall take such steps as are necessary to communicate with individual holders and legend or retain possession of certificates evidencing all Restricted Shares that are to be assumed and converted in accordance with the foregoing, so as to ensure that such shares may not be tendered for purchase in the Tender Offer or exchanged for payment in the Merger. 

  

  

 Section 1.12. _ Payment of Per Share Price._ 

  

  

 (a) Parent shall appoint Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., or another commercial bank or trust company as a paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the benefit of the holders of Shares that are not Dissenting Shares and who are entitled to receive the Per Share Price (collectively, the " _Holders_ "). At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Paying Agent an amount of cash sufficient to permit payment of the Per Share Price to the Holders (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall exchange the Shares for the Per Share Price in accordance with the terms of this Article I, through such reasonable procedures as the Paying Agent or Parent may adopt. 

  

 (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent or the Paying Agent shall cause to be mailed to each record holder of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares converted in the Merger (the " _Certificates_ ") a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall 

  

      

  
  

contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
and payment of the Per Share Price). Upon surrender for cancellation to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate held by any Holder, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, the Holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor that amount of cash equal to the Per
Share Price for each Share represented by the Certificate. Any Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amounts shall be payable at the Effective Time with respect to any Dissenting Shares or any Shares with respect to which dissenters\' rights have not terminated. In the case of Dissenting Shares or other Shares as to which the fair value shall be required to be paid pursuant to Articles 5.12 and 5.16 of the TBCA, payment shall be made in accordance with Section 1.18 and the TBCA. In the case of any Shares with respect to which dissenters\' rights irrevocably terminate after the Effective Time, such Shares shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Price in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.12. 

  

 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former Holders six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand of Parent, and any former Holders who have not theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Per Share Price. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for cash delivered to a public official in connection herewith pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

  

 Section 1.13. _ Transfer Taxes; Withholding._ If any cash is to be paid to or issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to Parent or the Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of cash in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent or the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Parent or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as Parent or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Paying Agent and transmitted by Parent or the Paying Agent to the appropriate taxing authority with attribution to each specific Holder. 

  

 Section 1.14. _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All amounts paid to Holders upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares represented by such Certificates. 

   

 Section 1.15. _ Closing of Company Transfer Books._ At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Shares shall thereafter be made on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. 

  

 Section 1.16. _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with respect to such Certificate, Parent or the Paying Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the amounts to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 1.11. 

       

    

  Section 1.17. _ Further Assurances._ If at any time
after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be
advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other
acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or
confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title
or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises,
properties or assets of either of the Constituent Corporations, or (b)
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving
Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of the
Constituent Corporations, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of either Constituent
Corporation, all such other acts and things as may be necessary, desirable or
proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving Corporation\'s right, title
or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers,
franchises, properties or assets of such Constituent Corporation and otherwise
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

  

 Section 1.18. _ Dissenters\' Rights._ 

  

  

 (a) Shares that have not been voted for approval of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and with respect to which written objection to the Merger has been properly made in accordance with Article 5.12 of the TBCA (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") or Shares with respect to which dissenters\' rights have not terminated will not be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation the Per Share Price otherwise payable with respect to such shares at or after the Effective Time. If a holder of Dissenting Shares (a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") withdraws his or her objection or demand for payment of the fair value of his or her Shares or such Dissenting Shares (or such other shares with respect to which dissenters\' rights have not terminated) become ineligible for such payment, then, as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event of withdrawal or ineligibility, whichever last occurs, such holder\'s Dissenting Shares will cease to be Dissenting Shares (or, in the case of such other shares, the dissenters\' rights shall have terminated) and each Share will be converted into the right to receive, and will be exchangeable for, the Per Share Price into which such Dissenting Shares (or such other shares) would have been converted pursuant to Section 1.11. 

  

 (b) The Company shall give Parent and Sub prompt notice of any objection to the Merger received by the Company from a Dissenting Shareholder, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such objection. The Company agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Parent and Sub, or as required under the TBCA, it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer or agree to settle, any such objection. Each Dissenting Shareholder or other shareholder who, pursuant to the provisions of Article 5.12 or 5.16 of the TBCA, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares (or other shares) will receive payment therefor after the fair value therefor has been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions, and any Per Share Price that would have been payable with respect to such Dissenting Shares (or other shares) will be retained by Parent.

 Section 3.5. _ Financial Statements._ 

  

  

 (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.5(a) of the Company Letter, the Company has filed all required forms, reports and documents with the SEC since December 31, 2000 (the " _Company SEC Reports_ "), each of which complied at the time of filing in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and each Applicable Law as in effect on the dates such forms, reports and documents were filed. None of such Company SEC Reports, including any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein, contained when filed any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, except to the extent superseded or amended by a Company SEC Report filed subsequently and prior to the date hereof. The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Reports (the " _Financial Statements_ ") fairly presented in all material respects, in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and except that unaudited statements are subject to normal year-end adjustments that did not and would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, and do not contain footnotes in substance or form to the extent omission thereof is permitted by Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act), the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended.

assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices. No attorney representing the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company, whether or not employed by the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws,
breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Company Board or any committee
thereof or to any director or officer of the Company.

 Section 3.6. _ No Default._ Except as set forth in Section 3.6 of the Company Letter, the Company is not in breach, default or violation (and no event has occurred that with notice or the lapse of time or both would constitute a breach, default or violation by the Company) of any term, condition or provision of (i) its Articles of Incorporation or By-laws, (ii) any Material Contract, (iii) any order, writ, injunction, decree, law, statute, rule, or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its properties or assets except, in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii) above, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. 

  

 Section 3.7. _ Absence of Certain Changes or Events._ 

  

  

 (a) Except as and to the extent disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed on or before the date hereof, since June 30, 2005 (the " _Company Balance Sheet Date_ "), (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have not incurred any material liability or obligation (indirect, direct or contingent), or entered into any material oral or written agreement or other transaction, that is not in the ordinary course of business, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries have not sustained any material loss or material interference with their business or properties from fire, flood, windstorm, accident or other calamity (whether or not covered by insurance), (iii) there has been no change in the authorized or issued capital stock of the Company except for the issuance of Shares pursuant to Company Stock Options; (iv) there has been no dividend or distribution of any kind declared, paid or made by the Company on any class of its stock, (v) there has not been (A) any adoption of a new Company Plan (as hereinafter defined), (B) any amendment to a Company Plan increasing benefits thereunder, (C) any granting by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer or other key employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any increase in compensation, except in the ordinary course of business consistent with prior practice or as was required under employment agreements in effect as of the date of the Company Balance Sheet Date, (D) any granting by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any such executive officer or other key employee of any increase in severance or termination agreements in effect as of the Company Balance Sheet Date, or (E) any entry by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries into any employment, severance or termination agreement with any such executive officer or other key employee, and (vi) other than amendment of the Rights Plan pursuant to Sections 3.28 and 5.10 hereof, amendment of any term of any outstanding security of the Company or any Subsidiary.

Adverse Effect on the Company, nor any development that would, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Material Adverse
Change_ " or " _Material Adverse Effect_ " mean, when used with respect to
the Company, any change or effect that is or would reasonably be expected (as
far as can be foreseen at the time) to be materially adverse to the business,
operations, and condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than such changes, effects or
circumstances reasonably attributable to: (i) economic, capital market or
political conditions generally in the United States or foreign economies in
any locations where the Company and its Subsidiaries have material operations
or sales; (ii) conditions generally affecting the industry in which the

its obligations, or the satisfaction of the conditions to the Offer or the

(vii) any change in the trading price or trading volume of the Company\'s
common stock in and of itself; (viii) any failure, in and of itself, by the
Company to meet published revenue or earnings projections or any internal or
other estimates, predictions, projections or forecasts of revenue, net income
or any other measure of financial performance; or (ix) any fact, circumstance
or condition disclosed in the Company Letter to the extent such change, effect
or circumstance is specifically set forth in the Company Letter or apparent
on its face without additional information.

  

 (c) Since the Balance Sheet Date, the Company has not incurred any liabilities (including Tax liabilities) of any nature, whether absolute or contingent, of a type required to be recorded on a balance sheet or disclosed in the notes thereto under GAAP other than liabilities incurred in the ordinary course, none of which would, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has no Indebtedness.

 (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.8(a) of the Company Letter, the Company and its Subsidiaries are and at all times have been in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Entity necessary for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), and no suspension or cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. Except as set forth in Section 3.8(a) of the Company Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been in violation of (i) any Company Permits, or (ii) any Applicable Law, including any consumer protection, equal opportunity, customs, export control, foreign trade, foreign corrupt practices (including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), patient confidentiality, health, health care industry regulation and third-party reimbursement laws including under any Federal health care program (as defined in Section 1128B(f) of the U.S. Federal Social Security Act (together with all regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _SSA_ ")), except in the case of clauses (i) or (ii) as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. 

  

 (b) The Company is not subject to any consent decree from any Governmental Entity. The Company has not received any warning letter from the United States Food and Drug 

  

      

  
  

Administration (the " _FDA_ ") during the last three years. The Company has
received no communication from the FDA or any comparable state or
foreign regulatory agency or been notified during the last three years that
any product approval or clearance is withdrawn or modified or that such an
action is under consideration. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company is
in compliance, in all material respects, with all current applicable statutes,
rules, regulations, guidelines, policies or orders administered or issued by
the FDA or comparable foreign Governmental Entity including FDA\'s Quality
System Regulation, 21 C.F.R. Part 820; the Company does not have knowledge of
any facts which furnish any reasonable basis for any Form FDA-483
observations or regulatory or warning letters from the FDA, Section 305
notices, or other similar communications from the FDA or comparable foreign
entity; and since April 30, 1999, there have been no recalls, field
notifications, alerts or seizures requested or threatened relating to the
Company\'s products, except as set forth in Section 3.8 of the Company
Letter. The Company\'s products, where required, are being marketed under
valid premarket notifications under Section 510 (k) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 짠360(k), and 21 C.F.R. Part 807, Subpart E ("
_510(k)\'s_ ") or premarket approval applications approved by the FDA
in accordance with 21 U.S.C. 짠360(e) and 21 C.F.R. Part 814 (" _PMA\'s_ ").
All 510(k)\'s and PMA\'s for the Company\'s products are exclusively owned by
the Company, and there is no reason to believe that FDA is considering
limiting, suspending, or withdrawing any such 510(k)\'s or PMA\'s or changing
the marketing classification or labeling of any such products. To the
knowledge of the Company, there is no false information or significant
omission in any product application or product-related submission to the FDA
or comparable foreign Governmental Entity. The Company has obtained all
necessary regulatory approvals from any foreign regulatory agencies related to
the products distributed and sold by the Company. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary, nor the officers, directors, managing employees or agents (as
those terms are defined in 42 C.F.R. 짠1001.1001) of the Company or any
Subsidiary: (i) have engaged in any activities which are prohibited under, or
are cause for civil penalties or mandatory or permissive exclusion from, any
Federal health care program under Sections 1128, 1128A, 1128B, or 1877 of SSA
or related state or local statutes, including knowingly and willfully
offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any
kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in

 (c) There are no contracts or agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries having covenants not to compete that impair the ability of the Company to conduct its business as currently conducted in any material respect.

provisions of state, local, or foreign tax law) for any taxable period, other
than a group the common parent of which is Company; (ix) the Company does not
have any obligation with respect to Taxes of another Person (pursuant to

or foreign tax law) or any liability for Taxes of any predecessor entity; (x)
the unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries do not exceed the

 Section 3.12. _ ERISA._ 

  

  

 (a) A true and correct copy of each Company Plan has been made available to each of Parent and Sub. With respect to each Company Plan, the Company has made available to Parent a true and correct copy of (i) the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500) filed with the applicable government agency, (ii) each such Company Plan that has been reduced to writing and all amendments thereto, (iii) each trust agreement, insurance contract or administration agreement relating to each such Company Plan, (iv) a written summary of each unwritten Company Plan, (v) the most recent summary plan description or other written explanation of each Company Plan provided to participants, (vi) the most recent actuarial report or valuation relating to a Company Plan subject to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), (vii) the most recent determination letter or opinion letter and request therefor, if any, issued by the IRS with respect to any Company Plan intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, (viii) any request for a determination currently pending before the IRS, (ix) all correspondence with the IRS, the Department of Labor, or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation relating to any outstanding controversy or with respect to any matter that has been resolved in the previous three years, and (x) all forms and certificate samples used to comply with Sections 4980, 9801 and 9802 of the Code. Except as set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Company Letter, each Company Plan complies in form and has complied in operation in all material respects with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable statutes and governmental rules and regulations. Except as set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Company Letter, no "reportable event" (within the meaning 

  

      

  

of Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any Company Plan for
which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived. Neither the Company
nor any of its ERISA Affiliates (as hereinafter defined) has had any
obligation to contribute to any Company Multiemployer Plan within the past six
(6) years. No action has been taken, or is currently being considered, to
terminate or withdraw from any Company Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and
there is no reason to believe the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation would
initiate the termination of any such Plan. No Company Plan, nor any trust
created thereunder, has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as
defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived.

  

 (b) Except as listed in Section 3.12(b) of the Company Letter and except for routine contributions due and owing, with respect to the Company Plans, no event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which the Company or any Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate or Company Plan fiduciary could be subject to any material liability under the terms of such Company Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other Applicable Law.

during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
promptly make available to Parent all personnel of the Company or
its Subsidiaries knowledgeable about matters relevant to such inspections as

_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  

 (b) The Company agrees to provide Parent and its agents and representatives with reasonable access to its employees during normal working hours following the date of this Agreement, and after consultation with the Company to, among other things, permit Parent to deliver offers of continued employment contingent upon Closing and to provide information to such employees about Parent; _provided_ , that the Company and its agents and representatives shall be permitted to participate in any and all such activities.

 Section 5.3. _ No Solicitation or Negotiation._ 

  

  

 (a) The Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, take any of the following actions with any Person other than Parent and Sub: (i) solicit, initiate, entertain, or knowingly encourage or facilitate any proposals or offers from, or conduct discussions with or engage in negotiations with any Person relating to an Alternative Transaction; (ii) provide information with respect to it to any Person, other than Parent and Sub, relating to, or otherwise cooperate with, facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any such Person with regard to, an Alternative Transaction; or (iii) enter into any agreement with any Person providing for an Alternative Transaction.

 (b) As used in this Agreement: 

    

 (i) " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (A) a transaction pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) other than Parent or Sub, directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 10% of the outstanding Shares or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to the Merger, whether from the Company or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (B) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving the Company (other than the Merger), (C) any transaction pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) other than Parent or Sub acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Company representing more than 10% of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of the Company on a consolidated basis immediately prior to such transaction, (D) any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as a result of which the holders of Shares immediately prior to such transaction do not, in the aggregate, own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of capital stock and outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately after the consummation thereof, or (E) any other transaction that is conditioned or predicated on the Merger not being completed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or is intended or could reasonably be expected to result in the Merger not being so completed; and 

  

 (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written proposal (not solicited by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives in breach of Section 5.3(a) or (e)) made by a third party after the date of this Agreement that if consummated would result in such third party (or the holders of its equity) owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the Shares then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) to be (A) more favorable to the shareholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement including any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise), and (B) reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal. 

    

 (c) The Company will notify Parent as promptly as practicable (but in any event within 48 hours (or, during any five day period preceding a scheduled expiration of the Offer, within 24 hours)) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or of its Subsidiaries by any Person that informs the Company Board that it is considering making or has made an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Parent will be made orally and in writing, and will indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company will, on a reasonably current basis (but in any event within 48 hours (or, during any five day period preceding a scheduled expiration of the Offer, within 24 hours)), 

  

      

  

provide to Parent a written description of any material changes in the status
and any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request. The Company will also as promptly as
practicable (but in any event within 48 hours (or, during any five day period
preceding a scheduled expiration of the Offer, within 24 hours)),
notify Parent, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or
negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section
5.3(a).

  

 (d) The Company Board will not (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) the recommendation by the Company Board in favor of the Offer, this Agreement, and the Merger, (B) determine that this Agreement or the Merger is no longer advisable, (C) recommend that the shareholders of the Company reject this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, (D) resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such actions, or (E) recommend the approval or adoption of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) adopt or approve any Acquisition Proposal or withdraw its approval of the Offer, this Agreement, or the Merger, or resolve or agree to take any such actions, (iii) without limiting Section 5.3(d)(i), propose publicly to adopt or approve any Acquisition Proposal or propose publicly to withdraw its approval of the Offer, this Agreement, or the Merger or resolve or agree to take any such actions, or (iv) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, or another agreement (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which is intended or reasonably likely to lead to any Alternative Transaction or Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.3(a)) or resolve or agree to take any such actions (each board action set forth in clauses (i)-(iv) of this Section 5.3(d) being referred to herein as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). 

  

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company Board may in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f) and substantially concurrently therewith enter into a binding Alternative Acquisition Agreement containing the terms of a Superior Proposal; _provided, however,_ that (1) the Company Board may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f), and any purported termination pursuant to Section 7.1(f) will be void and of no force or effect, unless the Company has complied with all provisions of this Section 5.3, including the notification provisions in this Section 5.3, and with all applicable requirements of Section 7.5 (including the payment of the Termination Fee prior to or simultaneously with such termination) and (2) the Company may not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f), (x) until after the fifth day following Parent\'s receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal and that the Company Board will, subject to any action taken by Parent pursuant to this sentence, cause the Company to accept such Superior Proposal, which notice will specify the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and identify the Person making such Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the price or any other material term of a Superior Proposal will require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new five day period), and (y) unless after such fifth day such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and the Company Board so determines in accordance with the definition of "Superior Proposal". Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.1(f), nothing in this Section 5.3 will affect the obligations of the Company or the rights of Parent or Sub under any other provision of this Agreement, including the obligation of the Company to seek the Company Shareholder Approval pursuant to Section 5.6. 

  

      

  
  

 (e) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, agents and representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Parent and its representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Alternative Transaction and will use its best efforts to cause all persons other than Parent who have been furnished with confidential information regarding the Company in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. The Company agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from the confidentiality and stand still provisions of any agreement to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or becomes a party, and will immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have heretofore been given under any such provisions authorizing any Person to make an Acquisition Proposal, unless the Company Board determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal. 

  

 (f) The Company will ensure that the officers, directors, bankers and attorneys of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all other employees, agents and other representatives of the Company or its Subsidiaries, are aware of the restrictions in this Section 5.3 as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. Any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3 by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant, or other retained representative) of the Company or its Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the consent of the Company or its Subsidiaries, will be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3 by the Company.

In this regard but without limitation, each party hereto shall promptly inform the other of any material communication between such party and the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, or any other federal, foreign or state antitrust or competition Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated herein. 

  

      

  
  

 (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or otherwise, in connection with the compliance by the parties hereto with any Applicable Law (including the HSR Act and similar merger notification laws or regulations of any foreign Governmental Entity) and obtaining the consent or approval of any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval may be required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall not be required, or be construed to be required, to proffer to, or agree to: (i) sell or hold separate, or agree to sell or hold separate, before or after the Effective Time, any material assets, businesses or any material interests in any assets or businesses, of Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates (or to consent to any sale, or agreement to sell, by Parent or the Company of any material assets or businesses, or any material interests in any assets or businesses), or any material change in or material restriction on the operation by Parent or the Company of any assets or businesses, (ii) enter into any agreement or be bound by any obligation that, in Parent\'s good faith judgment, would likely have a material adverse effect on the benefits to Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) take any other action that, in Parent\'s good faith judgment, would be materially adverse to Parent.

permitted by Applicable Law or provided in the Company\'s articles of
incorporation, by-laws and indemnity agreements, all as in effect on the date
hereof; _provided_ that such indemnification shall be subject to any
limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will cause to be maintained for a period of not less
than six years from and after the Effective Time the Company\'s current
directors\' and officers\' insurance and indemnification policy to the extent
that it provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time
(the " _D andO Insurance_") for all persons who are directors and officers of
the Company on the date of this Agreement, so long as the annual premium
therefor would not be in excess of two times the amount per annum the Company
paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount has been disclosed to Parent,
on terms and conditions substantially similar to the existing DandO Insurance.
If the existing DandO Insurance cannot be maintained, expires or is terminated
or canceled during such six-year period, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
will use reasonable efforts to cause to be obtained as much DandO Insurance as
can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an annualized premium
not in excess of two times the amount per annum the Company paid in its last
full fiscal year, on terms and conditions substantially similar to the
existing DandO Insurance. It is understood that, unless made by a court, any
determination as to whether a person seeking indemnification pursuant to this
Section 5.11 has met any applicable legal standard for indemnification shall
be made by independent counsel, as that term is contemplated under Applicable
Law, appointed by the Surviving Corporation and reasonably acceptable to the
person seeking such indemnification.

  

 (b) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Section 5.11, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11; provided that, in the case of any such assignment by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for all of their respective obligations under this Agreement. In addition, if the Surviving Corporation is financially unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations under this Section 5.11, the Parent shall be deemed to have assumed and therefore be obligated to discharge such indemnification obligations to the same extent that the Surviving Corporation is so obligated, up to a maximum amount of $350,000,000 (and in no event shall Parent have any indemnification obligation under this Section 5.11 in excess of such amount). 

  

  

 Section 5.12. _ Section 16 Matters._ Parent, Sub and the Company agree to cooperate fully in the structuring and timing of any dispositions and acquisitions of equity securities by directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) of the Company pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to take, and cause their respective boards of directors or compensation committees to take, prior to the Effective Time, any and all such actions as may be reasonably necessary to afford an exemption from liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act for such acquisitions and dispositions. 

  

 Section 5.13. _ Employee Benefit Matters._ 

  

  

 (a) The Surviving Corporation shall provide employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries retained by the Surviving Corporation with employee benefits no less favorable in the aggregate than either (i) those benefits provided to Parent\'s similarly situated employees, or (ii) those benefits provided by the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided that the Surviving Corporation shall be under no obligation to retain any employee or group of employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries (subject to the severance terms or other provisions of existing employment agreements listed in Section 3.12(d) of the Company Letter). With respect to each 

  

      

  

employee benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (collectively, "
_Parent Benefit Plan_ ") in which employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") participate after the Effective
Time, for purposes of determining vesting and entitlement to benefits,
including for severance benefits and vacation or other leave entitlement,
service with the Company (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company
provides past service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent and the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that such service shall not be recognized
to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits
or to the extent that such service was not recognized under the corresponding
Company Plan, nor shall it be recognized with respect to any equity incentive
award granted on or after the Closing Date. To the extent (A) permitted by
Applicable Law and by the Parent Benefit Plan that may cover any Company
Employees and (B) to the extent that Company Employees are covered by the
Parent Benefit Plans, Parent shall cause any and all pre-existing condition
(or actively at work or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods and
evidence of insurability requirements under Parent Benefit Plans to be waived
with respect to such Company Employees and their eligible dependents and shall
provide them with credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or
similar payments) made during the plan year including the Effective Time for
the purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or
similar requirements under any Parent Benefit Plans in which they are eligible
to participate after the Effective Time.

  

 (b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section 5.13 with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any other person, including, without limitation, any employees, former employees, any participant in any Company Plan or any beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued employment with the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent. After the Effective Time, nothing contained in this Section 5.13 shall interfere with Parent\'s or the Surviving Corporation\'s right to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan or Parent Benefit Plan in accordance with Applicable Law and the terms of such plans, or to terminate the employment of any employee of the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason. In the event the Company\'s 401(k) plan is terminated, participants in such plan shall be offered the opportunity to transfer or make a direct rollover of any outstanding participant loans into a similar plan of the Parent or Surviving Corporation if permitted by such plan.

or other order.

  

 (d) _ Purchase of Shares._ Parent, Sub or their affiliates shall have purchased the Shares properly tendered pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ , however, that this condition shall be deemed to have been satisfied with respect to the obligation of Parent and Sub to effect the Merger if Parent and Sub fail to accept for payment or pay for Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer in violation of the terms of the Offer or of this Agreement. 

  

 

    
ARTICLE VII

 (ii) the Offer shall have expired, terminated or been withdrawn pursuant to its terms without any Shares having been purchased; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (ii) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been a principal reason for the failure of Parent or Sub to purchase Shares in the Offer; or 

   

 (iii) the Acceptance Date has not occurred by December 31, 2005 (the " _Final Date_ "); _provided_ that no party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (iii) if such party\'s failure to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement shall have been a principal reason that the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer shall not have occurred on or before such date; 

    

 (c) by the Company if: 

    

 (i) Parent, Sub or any of their affiliates shall have failed to commence the Offer on or prior to the fifteenth business day following the date of the initial public announcement of the Offer; _provided,_ that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c), (A) after the Offer has commenced or (B) if the Company is in breach of Section 1.2 of this Agreement in a manner that affects Parent or Sub\'s ability to commence the Offer; or 

  

 (ii) there shall have been a breach by Parent or Sub of any of their respective covenants or agreements hereunder that materially adversely affects (or materially delays) Parent\'s or Sub\'s ability to consummate the Offer or the Merger, and, in the case of a breach capable of being cured, Parent or Sub, as the case may be, has not cured such breach within thirty days after written notice by the Company thereof; or 

  

 (iii) there shall have been a breach of a representation or warranty on the part of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of Parent or Sub shall 

   

      

   
  

have become untrue, such that the ability of Parent or Sub to consummate the
Offer or the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be
materially adversely affected (or materially delayed) and, in the case of a
breach capable of being cured, Parent or Sub, as the case may be, has not
cured such breach within thirty days after written notice by the Company
thereof;

    

 (d) by Parent and Sub if: 

    

 (i) there has been a breach of a representation or warranty on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, such that the conditions set forth in Section (c) of Exhibit A would be incapable of being satisfied by the Final Date and, in the case of a breach capable of being cured, the Company has not cured such breach within thirty days after written notice by Parent or Sub thereof; or 

  

 (ii) there shall have been a breach by the Company of one or more of its covenants or agreements hereunder having, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or materially adversely affecting (or materially delaying) the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, and, in the case of a breach capable of being cured, the Company has not cured such breach within thirty days after written notice by Parent or Sub thereof; 

    

 (e) by Parent and Sub, if the Company shall have, prior to the Acceptance Date: 

    

 (i) effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; 

  

 (ii) willfully and materially breached its obligations under Section 5.3 of this Agreement; or 

  

 (iii) following receipt by the Company of an Acquisition Proposal, either (A) failed to file a Schedule 14D-9 in which the Company recommends against such Acquisition Proposal, or (B) failed to publicly reaffirm the Company Board\'s recommendation of the Offer, in each case, within five days of receipt of the Acquisition Proposal; 

    

 _provided, that_ if the Company sends a notice of its intention to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c), the sending of such notice in and
of itself shall not be deemed to be a breach or default by the Company that
would permit Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.1(e); or

  

 (f) by the Company prior to the Acceptance Date at such time as there shall have been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance with Section 5.3 as a result of a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(f) if the Company is in breach of Section 5.3 with respect to such Superior Proposal or such Company Adverse Recommendation Change. 

  

  

The right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of any party hereto, any Person
controlling any such party or any of their respective officers or directors,
whether prior to or after the execution of this Agreement.

  

 Section 7.2. _ Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability hereunder on the part of the Company, Parent, Sub or their respective officers or directors (except for the last sentence of Section 5.1(a), Section 5.2, Section 7.2, Section 7.5 and Article VIII which shall survive the termination); _provided, however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 7.2 shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for any willful breach of a representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement prior to such termination. 

       

    

  Section 7.3. _ Amendment._ Subject to compliance
with Applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the Company and Parent
(on behalf of itself and Sub), by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of the
Company, except that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, there may not be, without
further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that
reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to be delivered
under this Agreement to the holders of the Shares, other than as contemplated
by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

  

 Section 7.4. _ Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto by the other party, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of such party which may legally be waived. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. No delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party hereto of any right, power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right, power or privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. Unless otherwise provided, the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that the parties hereto may otherwise have at law or in equity. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. 

  

 Section 7.5. _ Termination Fees._ 

  

  

 (a) The Company will pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to $35,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") if this Agreement is terminated as follows: 

    

 (i) if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 (e)(i) or (iii), then the Company will pay the Termination Fee on the business day following such termination; 

  

 (ii) if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f), then the Company will pay the Termination Fee prior to or simultaneously with such termination; and 

  

 (iii) if (A) the Parent terminates this Agreement either pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) and such termination is the result of a willful breach of a covenant by the Company that results in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or pursuant to Section 7.1(e)(ii) and (B) the Company enters into an agreement providing for an Alternative Transaction within twelve months after such termination, then the Company will pay the Termination Fee at the time of execution of such agreement. 

    

 (b) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to Section 7.5, the Company will also pay to Parent interest on such amount from the date this payment was due until the date it was made equal to the lesser of (i) 8.5% per annum, compounded monthly, or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, on the date such payment was required to be made. It is specifically agreed that the amount to be paid pursuant to this Section 7.5 represents an alternate agreement and is not a penalty.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer (subject to the provisions of the Agreement and any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rules 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act), Parent and Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of or the payment for, any tendered Shares, if (i) there shall not have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Acceptance Date such number of outstanding Shares which, when added to the Shares, if any, beneficially owned by Parent or Sub, would constitute at least a majority of the Shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis on the Acceptance Date (on a "fully-diluted basis" meaning the number of Shares outstanding, together with the Shares which the Company may be required to issue pursuant to Company Stock Options that have vested as of the Acceptance Date (including all options for which vesting accelerates on the Acceptance Date) or that are scheduled to vest within 120 days following the Acceptance Date and any Shares owned by Parent, Sub or an affiliate of Parent or Sub) (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); (ii) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any other material foreign, federal or state, antitrust, competition or fair trade law, shall not have expired or terminated prior to the Acceptance Date, or (iii) at any time on or after the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Date, any of the following conditions shall have occurred and continued to exist: 

  

  

 (a) a court or other Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any law, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is then in effect and has the effect of, directly or indirectly, restraining, prohibiting or materially restricting the Offer or the Merger; or 

  

 (b) in connection with the compliance by Parent or Sub with any Applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any other material foreign, federal or state antitrust, competition or fair trade law), Parent shall be (i) required, or be construed to be required, to sell or divest any material assets or business or to materially restrict any material business operations, or (ii) prohibited from owning, or a material limitation shall be imposed on Parent\'s ownership of, any portion of the Company\'s material business or assets; or 

   

 (c) the failure of (i) any representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Agreement that is qualified by materiality to be true and correct when made, and to be true and correct on and as of the scheduled Expiration Date as if made through, on and as of such date (other than representations and warranties which address matters only as of a certain date, which shall be true and correct as of such certain date), or (ii) any of the representations and warranties that is not so qualified to be true and correct in all material respects when made, and to be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the scheduled Expiration Date as if made through, on and as of such date (other than representations and warranties which address matters only as of a certain date which shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such certain date); _provided,_ that this condition (c) shall not be deemed to exist unless any such breaches of representations or warranties (without regard to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" on the Company or similar qualifier threshold) individually or in the aggregate, has or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; or 

  

 (d) the failure of the covenants and obligations of the Company to have been performed pursuant to the terms of the Agreement in all material respects at or before the Acceptance Date; or 

  

      

  
  

 (e) Parent shall have failed to receive a certificate executed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company (in their respective capacities as officers of the Company), dated as of the scheduled Expiration Date to the effect that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Exhibit A have not occurred; or 

  

 (f) a Material Adverse Effect on the Company shall have occurred and continued to exist; or 

   

 (g) there shall have occurred and continued to exist (i) any general suspension of trading in, or limitation on prices for, securities on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange (excluding any coordinated trading halt triggered solely as a result of a specified decrease in a market index and suspensions or limitations resulting from physical damage to or interference with such exchange not related to market conditions), (ii) the declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United States (whether or not mandatory), or (iii) any material limitation (whether or not mandatory) by any U.S. governmental authority or agency on the extension of credit by banks or other financial institutions affecting Parent\'s ability to pay for the Shares; or 

  

 (h) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms; or 

  

 (i) prior to the Acceptance Date, there shall have been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. 

  

  

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Sub and may be asserted by either of them regardless or the circumstances giving rise to such conditions (other than the Minimum Condition) may be waived by Parent or Sub, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in the sole discretion of Parent or Sub. The failure by Parent or Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any right, the waiver of such right with respect to any particular facts or circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts or circumstances, and each right will be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
