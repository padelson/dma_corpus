ARTICLE II

 

 _Closing_

 

SECTION 2.01. _Equity Purchase Closing._ (a) The closing of the Equity
Purchase (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Cravath,
Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019, at 10:00
a.m., New York City time, on the second business day following the
satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted, waiver) of the conditions set
forth in Article VIII (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to
the extent 



 

7  permitted, waiver of such conditions) or at such other place, time and date
as shall be agreed between the Seller Entities and Buyer. The date on which
the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_
". Notwithstanding the foregoing, absent a written agreement between the
Seller Entities and Buyer, the Closing shall not occur earlier than the date
that is 30 days from the date of the CompanyÂ’s delivery of the information
set forth in Section 7.03(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b) At the Closing, (i) Direct Seller shall deliver to Buyer the certificates
(if any) representing the Interests, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by
membership interest powers duly endorsed in blank in proper form for transfer,
with appropriate transfer stamps, if any, affixed (it being understood that
such certificates will be delivered upon repayment of the Indebtedness with
respect to which such certificates are pledged, which repayment shall occur at
the Closing) and (ii) Buyer shall deliver in cash, by wire transfer, to (A)
Direct Seller, an amount equal to the Estimated Purchase Price _minus_ (I) the
Escrow Amount, (II) any Transaction Fees to be paid at the Closing and Change
of Control Payments to be paid at or after the Closing, as set forth in the
schedule required to be delivered by the Company under Section 7.11 and (III)
the Debt Pay-Off Amount, as set forth in the schedule required to be delivered
by the Company under Section 7.11, and (B) PNC Bank, National Association
(the " _Escrow Agent_ "), an amount of cash equal to $25,000,000 (the "
_Escrow Amount_ "), such deposit to constitute the escrow fund (the " _Escrow
Fund_ "). The Escrow Fund shall be governed by the terms of an escrow
agreement to be entered into by and among Buyer, Direct Seller, Holdco, on its
own behalf and in its capacity as the initial Interestholder Representative,
and the Escrow Agent, such escrow agreement to be substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Escrow Fund
shall be held in escrow and shall be available to satisfy any payments to
Buyer pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and to satisfy the indemnification
obligations of the Seller Entities and the Interestholders as provided in
Article XI.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Seller Entities.

SECTION 2.02. _Purchase Price Adjustment._ (a) As soon as practicable prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a written statement
setting forth the CompanyÂ’s good faith estimate of (i) the Working Capital
Amount as of the open of business on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated
Working Capital Amount_ ") and (ii) the Capital Expenditures Amount as of the
open of business on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Capital Expenditures
Amount_ "). The Purchase Price payable on the Closing Date shall be
preliminarily adjusted in accordance with Section 1.01 and the manner
contemplated by this Section 2.02 as if (x) the Estimated Working Capital
Amount were the actual Closing Working Capital Amount and (y) the Estimated
Capital Expenditures Amount were the actual Closing Capital Expenditures
Amount. The Purchase Price as so



 

8  preliminarily adjusted is referred to as the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ ".
With respect to any current assets or liabilities relating to Taxes, the
Estimated Working Capital Amount shall specifically describe such assets or
liabilities (including by identifying the component amounts and the
jurisdiction and types of Taxes to which such amounts relate).

 

(b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
the Seller Entities a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
its calculations of (i) the Working Capital Amount as of the open of business
on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Working Capital Amount_ ") and (ii) the
Capital Expenditures Amount as of the open of business on the Closing Date
(the " _Closing Capital Expenditures Amount_ ").

(c) During the 30-day period following receipt by the Seller Entities and
their representatives of the Closing Statement, and thereafter until any
dispute arising under this Section 2.02 is finally resolved, the Seller
Entities and their representatives (and, if retained as provided in this
Section 2.02(c), the Accounting Firm) shall be permitted to review all books
and records and other information of Buyer and its representatives relating to
the Closing Statement and shall be provided reasonable access to the persons
involved in the preparation of the Closing Statement. The Closing Statement
shall become final and binding upon the parties on the 30th day following
delivery thereof ( _provided_ that the Seller Entities may elect to accept
the computations set forth in the Closing Statement by written notice to
Buyer, in which case the Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon
the parties when such notice is given), unless the Seller Entities give
written notice of their disagreements with the Closing Statement (the "
_Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer prior to such date which shall specify
the nature of any disagreement so asserted. Any Notice of Disagreement shall
(i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of all disagreements so asserted
and (ii) only include disagreements that are based on mathematical errors or
based on the Closing Working Capital Amount and/or the Closing Capital
Expenditures Amount otherwise not being calculated in accordance with
Sections 1.02 and 2.02. If a Notice of Disagreement is given by the Seller
Entities in a timely manner, then the Closing Statement (as revised in
accordance with this Section 2.02(c)) shall become final and binding upon the
Seller Entities and Buyer on the earlier of (x) the date upon which the Seller
Entities and Buyer resolve in writing any differences they have with respect
to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (y) the date any
disputed matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement are finally resolved
in writing by Ernst and Young LLP (unless the parties agree in writing upon an
alternative nationally recognized public accounting firm) (the " _Accounting
Firm_ "). During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, the Seller Entities and Buyer shall seek in good faith to
resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to
the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. During such 30-day
period, Buyer and its representatives shall be permitted to review all books
and records and other information of the Seller Entities and their
representatives relating to the Notice of Disagreement and shall be provided
reasonable access to the persons involved in the preparation of the Notice of
Disagreement. If, at the end of such 30-day period, the Seller Entities and
Buyer have not resolved any such differences, the Seller Entities and Buyer
shall retain the Accounting Firm and submit to it for resolution any and all
matters that remain in dispute

 



 

9  and that were included in the Notice of Disagreement. The Accounting Firm,
acting as experts and not as arbitrators, shall be instructed to render its
determination of all matters submitted to it within 30 days following
submission. Buyer and the Seller Entities agree that they shall be bound by
the determination of the Accounting Firm; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
scope of such calculation by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to making
revised calculations only with respect to those items or amounts which are in
dispute between Buyer and the Seller Entities based on whether the Notice of
Disagreement identified (A) mathematical errors in the Closing Statement or
(B) calculations that were not otherwise computed in accordance with Sections
1.02 and 2.02, and the Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make
any other calculation or determination. The Accounting Firm will
be instructed to revise the Closing Statement to reflect the Closing Working
Capital Amount and the Closing Capital Expenditures Amount as may be revised
by such calculations of the Accounting Firm. Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over
the party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this Section 2.02 shall
be borne 50% by the Seller Entities and 50% by Buyer. The fees and
disbursements of the Seller EntitiesÂ’ advisors incurred in connection with
review of the Closing Statement and any Notice of Disagreement shall be borne
by the Seller Entities, and the fees and expenses of BuyerÂ’s advisors
incurred in connection with the Closing Statement and any Notice of
Disagreement shall be borne by Buyer.

 

(d) The Final Purchase Price shall be an amount equal to the Purchase Price
adjusted as follows:

 

(i) if the Closing Working Capital Amount is a lesser number (including being
a negative number that has a larger absolute value) than the Target Working
Capital Amount, an amount (expressed as a positive number) equal to the amount
by which the Target Working Capital Amount exceeds the Closing Working Capital
Amount shall be deducted in calculating the Final Purchase Price;

(ii) if the Closing Working Capital Amount is a greater number (including
being a negative number that has a smaller absolute value) than the Target
Working Capital Amount, an amount (expressed as a positive number) equal to
the amount by which the Closing Working Capital Amount exceeds the Target
Working Capital Amount shall be added in calculating the Final Purchase
Price; and

(iii) if the Closing Capital Expenditures Amount is less than the Target
Capital Expenditures Amount, an amount equal to the excess of the Target
Capital Expenditures Amount over the Closing Capital Expenditures Amount shall
be deducted in calculating the Final Purchase Price.

 

(e) If the Estimated Purchase Price is less than the Final Purchase Price,
Buyer shall, and if the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the Final
Purchase Price, the Seller Entities shall, within five business days after the
Closing Statement becomes final and binding on the parties hereto, make a
payment to the Seller Entities or Buyer, as 



 

10  applicable, in an amount in cash equal to such difference, together with
interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate of interest from time to time
announced publicly by Bank of America, N.A. as its prime rate, calculated on
the basis of the actual number of days elapsed, divided by 365, from the
Closing Date to the date of such payment; _provided_ that any payments to be
made by the Seller Entities pursuant to this Section 2.02(e) shall only be
made from the Escrow Fund and Buyer and the Seller Entities will deliver to
the Escrow Agent joint instructions within such five business day period
directing the Escrow Agent to make such payment.

 

SECTION 2.03. _Interestholder Representative._ (a) In order to efficiently
administer, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
any action to be taken by or on behalf of the Interestholders under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, each Interestholder hereby designates
Holdco as its representative (the " _Interestholder Representative_ ") for
all purposes under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

(b) Each Interestholder hereby authorizes the Interestholder Representative
to take any and all action as is contemplated to be taken by the
Interestholder Representative or by or on behalf of the Interestholders by the
terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

 

(c) In the event that the Interestholder Representative becomes unable to
perform its, his or her responsibilities under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement or resigns from such position, ABRY Partners, LLC (" _Abry_ ") is
hereby authorized to select another representative to fill such vacancy and
such substituted representative shall be deemed to be the Interestholder
Representative for all purposes of the Escrow Agreement.

(d) All decisions and actions by the Interestholder Representative under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall be binding upon each Interestholder,
and no Interestholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same.

 

(e) By its execution of or consent to be bound by this Agreement, each
Interestholder agrees that:

 

(i) Buyer shall be able to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions
of the Interestholder Representative as to any actions required to be taken
by the Interestholder Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement (including any action taken or purported to be taken by or on behalf
of any Interestholder), and no party hereto shall have any cause of action
against Buyer for any action taken by Buyer in reliance upon the instructions
or decisions of the Interestholder Representative;

 

(ii) all actions, decisions and instructions of the Interestholder
Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon each Interestholder and
no Interestholder shall have any cause of action against the Interestholder



 

11  Representative for any action taken, decision made or instruction given by
the Interestholder Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, except for fraud or willful breach of the Escrow Agreement by the
Interestholder Representative; and

(iii) the provisions of this Section 2.03 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Interestholder may have in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement.

Subsidiaries may vote. There are no securities, options, warrants, calls,

Company or such Subsidiary, and the Company and its Subsidiaries do not have
any obligation (including to inform or consult with any such employees or
their representatives in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) with respect to any such organization or agreement. Since the date
of its incorporation or organization, there has been no, and there currently

or penalty related thereto.

the applicable Interests on all matters properly presented to the applicable
members of the Company, or (4) seeking to prohibit Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries from effectively controlling in any respect a portion of the
business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company
and Buyer will provide such assistance, information and cooperation to each
other as is reasonably required to obtain any such nonactions, waivers,
consents, approvals, Orders and authorizations and, in connection therewith,
will notify the other Person promptly following the receipt of any comments
from any Governmental Authority and of any request by any Governmental
Authority for amendments, supplements or additional information in respect of
any registration, declaration or filing with such Governmental Authority and
will supply the other Person with copies of all correspondence between such
Person or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority, on the other hand.

 

(b) Without limiting Section 7.02(a), within five business days after the date
of this Agreement, Buyer and the Seller Entities will, or will cause their
relevant Affiliates to, make an appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and from time
to time thereafter shall supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material
that is requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Seller Entities and Buyer shall and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to request early termination of any waiting period or comparable period under
the HSR Act and, unless the Seller Entities and Buyer consent otherwise (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), will not
extend any such period unless such extension is required by any Governmental
Entity.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Sections 7.02(a) and (b), the Seller
Entities and the Company shall give Buyer, at BuyerÂ’s expense, the opportunity
to participate in (but not control) the defense of any Litigation against
either Seller Entity, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of
their respective managers or directors relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not enter into any settlement or other
accommodation with respect thereto that is binding on the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets without BuyerÂ’s prior
written consent; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 7.03 will require the
Seller Entities or the Company to take any action to the extent that doing so
would reasonably be expected to result in a



 

38  waiver of any applicable attorney-client, attorney work product, joint-
defense or tax preparer-taxpayer privilege.

 

SECTION 7.03. _Financing._ (a) Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable, and to execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered, such instruments and documents as may
be required, to arrange the Financing as promptly as reasonably practicable.
For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate the Equity Purchase
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein is not
conditioned upon the availability or consummation of the Financing, the
availability of any replacement financing or receipt of the proceeds
therefrom. If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable or Buyer
becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes any portion of the
Financing unavailable, in each case on the terms and conditions set forth in
the Commitment Letter, and such portion is required to consummate the Equity
Purchase, Buyer shall, as promptly as practicable, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from
alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Equity Purchase on terms no less favorable to Buyer than those set forth in
the Commitment Letter. Buyer shall give the Company prompt written notice of
any material breach by any party to the Commitment Letter or any condition to
the Financing becoming unable to be satisfied, in each case of which Buyer
becomes aware, or of any termination of the Commitment Letter. Buyer shall
keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of the
Financing.

 

(b) Subject to the last sentence of Section 7.01, the Company and each Seller
Entity shall provide and shall cause their Subsidiaries and respective
representatives to provide such cooperation in connection with the arrangement
of the Financing or any alternative financing to finance in whole or in part
the Equity Purchase as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, including by (i)
on or as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, (x)
furnishing to Buyer and its financing sources pertinent information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective operations
to be included in any prospectus, offering memorandum, rating agency
presentation, bank book, information memorandum, lender presentation or
similar document or marketing material, including the information set forth on
Schedule 7.03(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (y) assisting in
the preparation of such documents, (ii) furnishing the information set forth
in clauses (ii) and (iii) of Schedule 7.03(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule on the dates set forth therein, (iii) making the CompanyÂ’s chief
executive officer and chief financial officer (but not other Company
personnel, except as the Company may agree) available to participate in
meetings with prospective investors or lenders or rating agencies, (iv)
causing its independent accountants to provide reasonable assistance to Buyer
consistent with their customary practice, to participate in customary due
diligence and to provide the items listed in Section 7.03(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (v) providing reasonable cooperation with prospective
investors, arrangers, lenders, underwriters and their respective advisors in
performing their due diligence; _provided_ that none of the Company, the
Seller Entities or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any fee



 

39  or enter into any definitive agreement or incur any other liability in
connection with the Financing prior to the Closing; and _provided further_
that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company, the Seller Entities and their respective
Subsidiaries.

(c) Buyer shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Seller Entities, the
Company, their Subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives in
connection with such cooperation (other than any costs incurred in connection
with preparing and providing the information set forth on Section 7.03(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule), whether or not the Closing occurs. Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective representatives from and against any and all losses or damages
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing and any use of any information utilized in connection therewith,
whether or not the Closing occurs. The Company hereby consents to the use of
its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to
nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of it
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and its or their marks.

 

SECTION 7.04. _Fees and Expenses._ Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement, the Equity Purchase and the other transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or
expenses, whether or not the Equity Purchase and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated; _provided_ that Buyer shall pay all fees
in connection with the HSR filings relating to the Equity Purchase.

 

SECTION 7.05. _Additional Agreements._ In case at any time after the Closing
Date any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest Buyer with full title to the Interests, each party to
this Agreement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all such
necessary action.

VOLUNTARILY OR INVOLUNTARILY ASSIGNED OR TRANSFERRED OR PURPORTED TO ASSIGN
OR TRANSFER TO ANY PERSON ANY RELEASED MATTERS AND THAT NO PERSON OTHER THAN
SUCH SELLER OR INTERESTHOLDER HAS ANY INTEREST IN ANY RELEASED MATTER BY LAW
OR CONTRACT BY VIRTUE OF ANY ACTION OR INACTION BY SUCH SELLER
OR INTERESTHOLDER. THE INVALIDITY OR UNENFORCEABILITY OF ANY PART OF THIS
SECTION 7.06 SHALL NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THE REMAINDER
OF THIS SECTION 7.06, WHICH SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.

 

SECTION 7.07. _Public Announcements._ Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, none of the Company, the Seller Entities, Interestholders and
Buyer shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
without the written consent of the other parties hereto.

 

SECTION 7.08. _Confidentiality._ From and after the Closing, each Seller
Entity and Interestholder shall, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its Affiliates and their respective officers, managers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives, as applicable, to, keep
confidential and not disclose to any other Person, or use for their
own benefit or the benefit of any other Person, any information regarding the

deleted prior to the Closing, (b) ensure, prior to the Closing, that as of and

provisions of the Incentive Share Agreements that relate to enforcement of

of doubt, no obligations of Holdco with respect to any Incentive Share
Agreement shall be assigned or transferred hereunder.

SECTION 7.16. _Additional Interestholders._ The Seller Entities and the
Interestholders shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause, including
by the exercise of all rights under the Shareholders Agreement made as of July
3, 2007, by and among Holdco and the members and shareholders of Holdco party
thereto, prior to the Closing Date all other holders of membership interests
of Holdco that are not party to this Agreement (the " _Additional

SECTION 7.17. _Legal Representation._ (a) Recognizing that Kirkland and Ellis

Company, its Subsidiaries, the Seller Entities and certain of their Affiliates
prior to the Closing, Buyer hereby waives, on its own behalf, and on behalf
of the Company and its Subsidiaries effective as of the Closing, and agrees to
cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with
the Legal Representative representing the Seller Entities and/or their
Affiliates after the Closing in connection with the Seller Entities and/or
their Affiliates asserting or enforcing its or their rights under this
Agreement or making or defending any claim arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, all
communications involving attorney-client confidences between Holdco, any of
its Subsidiaries, any Interestholder or any of their respective Affiliates and
either the Legal Representative or Craig H. Cavalier (or both the Legal
Representative and Craig H. Cavalier) in the course of the negotiation,
documentation



 

44  and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and preparations
relating thereto shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong
solely to the Seller Entities and their Affiliates other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries. Accordingly, Buyer and its Affiliates, including the Company
and its Subsidiaries after the Closing, shall not have access to any such
communications, or to the files of the Legal Representative or Craig H.
Cavalier relating to any such representation, whether or not the Closing shall
have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and
after the Closing, (i) the Seller Entities and their Affiliates (and not the
Company and its Subsidiaries) shall be the sole holders of, and have the sole
right to waive, the attorney-client privilege with respect to any such
representation, and none of Buyer and its Affiliates, including the Company
and its Subsidiaries, shall be a holder of or have the right to waive such
privilege, (ii) to the extent that files of the Legal Representative or Craig
H. Cavalier in respect of such representation constitute property of the
client, only the Seller Entities and their Affiliates (and not the Company
and its Subsidiaries) shall hold such property rights and (iii) the Legal
Representative and Craig H. Cavalier shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal
or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between the Legal Representative or Craig H. Cavalier and the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or otherwise.

 

(b) The Seller Entities and Interestholders hereby acknowledge and agree,
that, after the Closing, Craig H. Cavalier may represent the Company in

contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that Craig H.
Cavalier shall not represent any of the parties hereto in connection with any
such party asserting or enforcing its rights under this Agreement or making
or defending any claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; it being understood that (i) Craig H. Cavalier
may represent a party controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim under
Section 11.04(a) and/or the Indemnified Person against whom such claim was
made, against such third party, and (ii) any party may discuss with Craig H.
Cavalier factual matters underlying a dispute under this Agreement, subject
to his obligations as counsel to the Company after the Closing and the
provisions of Section 7.17(a).

Section 8.01, 8.02 or 8.03, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such
failure was caused by such partyÂ’s failure to comply with the terms of this
Agreement, including Section 7.02 of this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, no Litigation commenced by any party to this Agreement or any of its
Affiliates will be deemed to cause the conditions set forth in Section 8.01(b)
or Section 8.02(d) to be not satisfied.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

 _Certain Tax Matters_

 

SECTION 9.01. _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes._ (a)
Holdco shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and
filed, on a basis consistent with the past practices of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
such Tax Returns shall not be filed without the written consent of Buyer which
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Holdco shall pay, or cause to be paid, all
Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.

 

(b) Buyer shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and
filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period and shall present such Tax Returns to
Holdco for review at least 30 days prior to the date on which such Tax Returns
are required to be filed. Buyer shall consider in good faith any suggestions
or comments made by Holdco after such review. Buyer shall timely pay all
Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
portion of such Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
reflected as a liability in the Working Capital Amount. In the case of any
Straddle Period (i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle

 



 

48  Period and (ii) all other Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date.

 

SECTION 9.02. _Control of Audits; Cooperation._ (a) Subject to the provisions
of Article XI, Buyer shall be entitled to control any audit, suit, action or
proceeding related to the Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries ("Tax
Claims"); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Buyer shall notify the
Interestholder Representative of significant developments with respect to
such Tax Claims controlled by Buyer and (ii) Buyer shall not settle or
compromise any Tax Claim for which the Seller Entities or Interestholders will
have an indemnity obligation under Article XI without the prior
written consent of the Interestholder Representative (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld).

(b) Buyer, the Seller Entities and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and other
representatives to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns
(including Tax Returns of the Seller Entities) with respect to all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods or Straddle Periods, including by maintaining and making
available all books and records in connection with Taxes in their possession
and making available personnel to the extent reasonably requested to do so. 

SECTION 9.03. _Transfer Taxes._ All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and applicable real estate transfer and stock transfer Taxes
applicable to the Equity Purchase shall be borne 50% by the Seller Entities
and 50% by Buyer.

 

SECTION 9.04. _Tax Sharing Agreements._ The Company shall cause any Tax
sharing or similar agreements or arrangements between the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any other Person, on the other hand, to be
terminated on or before the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, no Person
shall have any rights or obligations under any such agreements or
arrangements. 

SECTION 9.05. _FIRPTA Certificate._ On the Closing Date, Holdco shall deliver
to Buyer a certificate certifying that the Equity Purchase is exempt from
withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.

SECTION 9.06. _Treatment of Equity Purchase_. For U.S. Federal income Tax
purposes, Buyer and the Seller Entities shall treat and report the Equity
Purchase as an acquisition by Buyer of all of the assets of the Company from
the Seller Entities in exchange for the Final Purchase Price and the amount
of all liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date
(subject to the provisions of Article XI of this Agreement).

 

SECTION 9.07. _Purchase Price Adjustment and Allocation._ (a) Buyer and the
Seller Entities shall treat any amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.02 and
Article XI, as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for all Tax purposes
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

(b) Buyer and the Seller Entities shall allocate the Final Purchase Price and
the amount of all liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing



 

49  Date among the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Purchase
Price Allocation_ "). The Purchase Price Allocation shall be prepared in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. Neither Buyer nor the Seller
Entities (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall file any Tax Return,
or take any position with any Governmental Authority, that is inconsistent
with the Purchase Price Allocation.

 

(c) Buyer shall deliver a draft of the Purchaser Price Allocation (the "
_Proposed Purchase Price Allocation_ ") to the Interestholder Representative
for review as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date (and in no
event later than 180 days after the Closing Date).

 

(d) The Interestholder Representative shall raise any objections to the
Proposed Purchase Price Allocation within 30 days after delivery by Buyer.
Buyer and the Interestholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any differences for 30 days after delivery of such objection. If Buyer
and the Interestholder Representative reach written agreement within this
period, the Proposed Purchase Price Allocation, as amended by such written
agreement, shall become the Purchase Price Allocation.

(e) In the event that Buyer and the Interestholder Representative cannot
agree on the appropriate allocation within the 30-day negotiation period set
forth in Section 9.08(d) above, the matter shall be referred to an independent
valuation expert (whose fees shall be borne equally by Buyer and the Seller
Entities) for resolution as promptly as practicable. The final determination
of the valuation expert shall be binding upon Buyer and the Seller Entities as
the Purchase Price Allocation. 

ARTICLE X

 

 _Termination, Amendment and Waiver_

 

SECTION 10.01. _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated, and the Equity
Purchase contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by written consent of Buyer, the Seller Entities and the Company;

 

(b) by either Buyer, on the one hand, or the Seller Entities and the Company,
on the other hand:

 

(i) if the Equity Purchase shall not have been consummated by the earlier of
(A) the date that is 60 days from the date of the CompanyÂ’s delivery of the
information set forth in Section 7.03(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
and (B) July 26, 2010, for any reason; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.01(b)(i) shall not be
available to any party if such failure of the Equity Purchase to occur on or
before such date was caused by such partyÂ’s failure to comply with the terms
of this Agreement, including Section 7.02 of this Agreement; or



 

50 (ii) if any Legal Restraint which has an effect set forth in Section 8.01(b)
shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable;

(c) by Buyer (i) if the Company, any Seller Entity or any Interestholder
shall have breached in any material respect any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement or if any of the representations or warranties of
any Seller Entity, any Interestholder or the Company contained herein fails
to be true and correct, which breach or failure (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.02(a) or (b), and (B) has not
been or is not reasonably capable of being cured within 30 days after the
Seller EntitiesÂ’ receipt of written notice thereof from Buyer or (ii) if any
Legal Restraint having any of the effects set forth in clauses (i) through
(iv) of Section 8.02(c) shall be in effect and shall have become final and
nonappealable; or

(d) by any Seller Entity or the Company, if Buyer shall have breached in any
material respect any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement or if any of the representations or warranties of Buyer contained
herein fails to be true and correct, which breach or failure (i) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.03(a) or (b) and
(ii) has not been or is not reasonably capable of being cured by Buyer within
30 days after its receipt of written notice thereof from the Company.

 

SECTION 10.02. _Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this
Agreement by the Company, the Seller Entities or Buyer as provided in Section
10.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without
any liability or obligation on the part of any Seller Entity or
Interestholder, Buyer or the Company or any of their respective
officers, managers or directors, other than the provisions of Section 3.19
(relating to brokerÂ’s fees), the final sentence of Section 7.08 (relating to
the Confidentiality Agreement), BuyerÂ’s obligations to provide reimbursement
and indemnity pursuant to Section 7.03(c), the provisions of Section 7.04
(relating to fees and expenses), this Section 10.02 and Article XII, which
shall in each case survive any such termination, and except to the extent that
such termination results from a material breach by a party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 10.02 shall be deemed to release any party
from any liability for any breach by such party of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement if this Agreement is terminated or to impair the right of
any party to compel specific performance by any other party of its obligations
under this Agreement prior to termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.03. _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended at any time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be made no amendment that by Law
requires approval by members or stockholders of the parties without the
approval of such members or stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of Buyer, Direct Seller,
Holdco and the Interestholder Representative.

SECTION 10.04. _Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to or after the
Closing, Buyer, the Seller Entities, the Company and the Interestholder
Representative may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the 



 

51  other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or
(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be made no amendment that by
Law requires approval by members or stockholders of the parties without the
approval of such members or stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party; _provided_ that to the
extent indicated in such an instrument executed by the Interestholder
Representative, any such extension or waiver by the Interestholder
Representative will be valid and binding on all Interestholders. The failure
or delay by any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall
any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its
rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such
rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

ARTICLE XI

 

 _Indemnification_

 

SECTION 11.01. _Indemnification by the Seller Entities and the
Interestholders._ (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article
XI, from and after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective
subsidiaries, officers, managers, directors, employees and agents
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be held harmless
and indemnified by the Escrow Fund and, to the extent provided under Section
11.01(b), each Seller Entity and Interestholder, to the extent of any Losses
arising from, in connection with or otherwise with respect to:

 

(i) any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation or warranty of either
Seller Entity or the Company contained in Articles III or IV or in the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 8.02(a) to the extent relating to
such representations and warranties (it being agreed that for purposes of
determining the existence of any such inaccuracy or breach or the amount of
any Loss with respect thereto, all such representations and warranties that
are qualified as to materiality, other than by reference to a specified dollar
amount, or by reference to a Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed to be not
so qualified; _provided_ that, with respect to the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 3.06(a) and 3.08(a)(xiv) and in the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 8.02(a) to the extent relating to
such representations and warranties, the foregoing exclusion shall not apply
for purposes of determining the existence of any inaccuracy or breach of such
representation and warranty, but shall apply for purposes of determining the
amount of any Loss with respect thereto);

(ii) any failure by either Seller Entity or (prior to the Closing) the Company
to perform, fulfill or comply with any covenant, agreement, obligation or
undertaking contained in this Agreement;



 

52 (iii) any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation or warranty of
any Interestholder contained in Article IV or in the certificate delivered
pursuant to Section 8.02(a) to the extent relating to such representations (it
being agreed that for purposes of determining the existence of any such
inaccuracy or breach or the amount of any Loss with respect thereto, all such
representations and warranties that are qualified as to materiality or by
reference to a Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed to be not so
qualified);

 

(iv) any failure by any Interestholder to perform, fulfill or comply with any
covenant, agreement, obligation or undertaking contained in this Agreement;
and

(v) any Third Party Claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
any obligation required under applicable Law, to the extent such claim or
obligation relates to the time period prior to, or arises out of events
occurring prior to or conditions existing as of, the Closing.

 

(b) In the event that any Seller-Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification under this Section 11.01 and the amounts remaining in the
Escrow Fund are insufficient or unavailable (including as a result of the
Escrow Funds having been released to the Seller Entities or the
Interestholders under the terms of the Escrow Agreement) to address any such
indemnification obligation, then in each such case each Seller Entity and
Interestholder shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article XI,
indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties to the extent of any such
Loss but only to the extent that such Loss exceeds the amounts then remaining
in the Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article
XI, prior to making any indemnification claim pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or
(v) of Section 11.01(a) against any Seller Entity or Interestholder directly,
an Indemnified Party must first make a claim against the Escrow Fund until the
Escrow Fund is depleted in its entirety.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article XI (except as provided
in Section 11.06):

 

(i) no Person shall have any liability under clauses (i), (ii) and (v) of
Section 11.01(a) for any Losses unless the aggregate amount of such Losses
for which indemnification would otherwise be available under such clause
exceeds $500,000 (the " _Deductible Amount_ "), in which event recovery by the
Indemnified Parties shall be limited to that portion of such Losses that
exceeds the Deductible Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitation
set forth in this clause (i) shall not apply to any claim for indemnification
to the extent arising out of an inaccuracy or breach of any Specified Seller
Representation;

(ii) the Seller Entities and the Interestholders shall have no liability
under clauses (i), (ii) and (v) of Section 11.01(a) other than indirect
liability in the form of payments from the Escrow Fund, and no Seller-
Indemnified Person shall have recourse to any Person in respect of any such
liability other than from the Escrow Fund; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
limitation set forth in this clause (ii) shall not

 



 

53  apply to any claim for indemnification to the extent arising out of an
inaccuracy or breach of any Specified Seller Representation;

 

(iii) no Interestholder shall have any liability or obligation, other than
indirect liability in the form of payments from the Escrow Fund, (A) pursuant
to clause (i) of Section 11.01(a) other than in respect of an inaccuracy in,
or breach of, a Specified Seller Representation made by Seller or the Company,
or (B) pursuant to clause (ii) or (v) of Section 11.01(a);

(iv) neither Seller Entity will have any liability or obligation, and
no Seller-Indemnified Person shall have any right to be indemnified from the
Escrow Fund, pursuant to clause (iii) or (iv) of Section 11.01(a);

 

(v) an InterestholderÂ’s liability for any Losses pursuant to clause (i) of
Section 11.01(a) (which shall be limited as provided in clause (iii) above)
shall not exceed such InterestholderÂ’s Pro Rata Share of such Losses that are
not paid by the Seller Entities or from the Escrow Fund;

 

(vi) no Interestholder will have any liability or obligation with respect to
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, obligation or undertaking
of any other Interestholder, any inaccuracy therein or any breach thereof; and

 

(vii) an InterestholderÂ’s liability under this Section 11.01(a) shall not
exceed the aggregate portion of the Final Purchase Price that such
Interestholder receives from Holdco on or after the Closing Date.

(d) For purposes of this Article XI, the amount of any Loss suffered or
incurred by the Seller-Indemnified Persons shall be determined net of any
amounts recovered by any of the Seller-Indemnified Persons (including the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) under insurance policies with respect to
such Loss.

(e) For purposes of this Article XI, Losses shall not include any liability
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the extent such amount (i) was
included in the Debt Pay-Off Amount or constituted a Change of Control Payment
or Transaction Fee, in each case to the extent paid prior to or at the
Closing or listed on the schedule to be provided by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.11 or (ii) was reflected as a liability in the Closing Working
Capital Amount.

 

(f) The obligations of each Seller Entity and Interestholder under Section
11.01 shall not be affected by any knowledge by any Seller-Indemnified Party
at or prior to the Closing of any breach of representation or warranty,
whether such knowledge came from the Company, any Seller Entity or any other
Person, or any waiver of Section 8.02.

 

SECTION 11.02. _Indemnification by Buyer._ Subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article XI, from and after the Closing, each Seller Entity,
each Interestholder, their respective Affiliates and the respective
subsidiaries, officers, managers, directors, employees and agents of the
foregoing (collectively, the " _Buyer-_



 

54   _Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be held harmless and indemnified by Buyer to
the extent of any Losses arising from, in connection with or otherwise with
respect to:

 

(i) any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation or warranty of Buyer
contained in Article V or the certification delivered pursuant to Section
8.03(a) (it being agreed that for purposes of determining the existence of any
such inaccuracy or breach or the amount of any Loss with respect thereto, all
such representations and warranties that are qualified as to materiality
shall be deemed to be not so qualified); and

(ii) any failure by Buyer or (after the Closing) the Company to perform,
fulfill or comply with any covenant, agreement, obligation or undertaking
contained in this Agreement.

 

SECTION 11.03. _Termination of Indemnification._ Except with respect to any
fraud, willful concealment or willful misconduct, each Seller EntityÂ’s,
InterestholderÂ’s and BuyerÂ’s obligations to indemnify and hold harmless any
other party pursuant to clauses (i) (other than with respect to the Specified
Seller Representations), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of Section 11.01(a) and
clauses (i) (other than with respect to the Specified Buyer Representations)
and (ii) of Section 11.02, as applicable, shall terminate on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to
any item as to which the applicable Seller-Indemnified Party or Buyer-
Indemnified Party (in either case, the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall have,
before such first anniversary, previously made a claim by delivering a notice
of such claim in accordance with this Agreement to the applicable Indemnitor,
which obligations shall survive until all such claims have are resolved. Any
other obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Party shall
terminate 90 days after expiration of the relevant statute of limitations,
taking into account extensions thereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such
obligations shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the
applicable Indemnified Party has, before the expiration of the relevant
period, taking into account extensions thereof, made a claim by delivering
a notice of such claim in accordance with this Agreement to the Seller
Entities, which obligations shall survive until such claim has been resolved.

 

SECTION 11.04. _Procedures._ (a) _Third Party Claims._ (i) If a claim by a
third party is made against an Indemnified Party in respect of, arising out
of or involving a matter for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to this Article XI (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
Indemnified Party must notify the Seller Entities and the Interestholder
Representative (if such Indemnified Party is a Seller-Indemnified Party and
intends to seek indemnification pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (v) of
Section 11.01(a)), the Interestholder subject to such claim (if such
Indemnified Party is a Seller-Indemnified Party and intend to seek indemnity
pursuant to clause (iii) or (iv) of Section 11.01(a)) or Buyer (if such
Indemnified Party is a Buyer-Indemnified Party) (the Seller Entities,
the Interestholder Representative and Buyer are referred to herein as the "
_Indemnitors_ ") in writing of the Third Party Claim promptly following
receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party
Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall
not affect the indemnification provided hereunder

 



 

55  except to the extent (and only to the extent) such party (or, in the case of
a claim made pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (v) of Section 11.02(a), the
Seller Entities or the Interestholders) shall have been actually and
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(ii) The Indemnitor shall be entitled to assume and control the defense
(including settlement) of a Third Party Claim, through counsel of the
IndemnitorÂ’s choice, at the IndemnitorÂ’s expense; _provided_ that, if the
Indemnitor elects to assume and control the defense of such Third Party
Claim, then the Indemnified Party may participate in (but not control) such
defense, through counsel of its choice, at its own expense. In conducting such
defense, the Indemnitor may elect, subject to Section 11.04(a)(iv), to pursue
or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and
conferences with any Governmental Authority with respect thereto, and, subject
to Section 11.04(a)(iv), may, in its sole discretion, either pay the amount
claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund suits or
settle or contest the Third Party Claim.

 

(iii) So long as the Indemnitor is controlling the defense of a Third Party
Claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates shall (and the
parties hereto shall and shall cause their Affiliates to) reasonably cooperate
with the Indemnitor by providing records and information that are reasonably
relevant to such Third Party Claim.

 

(iv) Whether or not the Indemnitor has elected to control the defense of any
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise such
Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnitor; provided that
no such consent will be required if the Indemnified Party agrees (on behalf
itself and all other Seller-Indemnified Parties or other Buyer-Indemnified
Parties, as the case may be) to forego all claims for indemnification under
this Article XI with respect to such Third Party Claim, so long as such
Indemnified Party uses reasonable efforts to obtain in such settlement
a release of the Seller Entities and the Interestholders (in the case of a
Seller-Indemnified Party) or Buyer (in the case of a Buyer-Indemnified Party)
with respect to all such Third Party Claims. If the Indemnitor elects to
control the defense of any Third Party Claim, then the Indemnitor shall not
settle or compromise such Third Party Claim without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party; provided that no such consent will be required if such
settlement or compromise imposes no obligation on the Indemnified Party other
than (A) obligations that are to be satisfied by or on behalf of the
Indemnitor, (B) granting a general release relating to the subject matter of
such Third Party Claim, and (C) customary confidentiality and other
undertakings relating to such settlement, compromise and release.

(b) _Direct Claims._ In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim
under Section 11.01 or 11.02 that does not involve a Third Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable
promptness to the Indemnitor. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to
notify the Indemnitor shall not relieve the

 



 

56  Indemnitor from any liability that it may have to such Indemnified Party
under Section 11.01 or 11.02, except to the extent (and only to the extent)
that such party (or, in the case of a claim made pursuant to clause (i), (ii)
or (v) of Section 11.02(a), the Seller Entities or the Interestholders) shall
have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. If
the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days following
its receipt of such notice that the Indemnitor disputes the Seller EntitiesÂ’
liability to the Indemnified Party under Section 11.01 or 11.02, as
applicable, such claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice
shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Seller Entities under Section
11.01 (if asserted by a Seller-Indemnified Party under clause (i), (ii) or (v)
of Section 11.01(a)), a liability of the Interestholder in question (if
asserted by a Seller-Indemnified Party under clause (iii) or (iv) of Section
11.01(a)), or a liability of Buyer under Section 11.02 (if asserted by a
Buyer-Indemnified Party), and the Seller Entities, such Principal
Interestholder or Buyer, as the case may be, shall pay or cause to be paid to
the extent otherwise provided in this Article XI the amount of such liability
to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the
amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date
when the amount of such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally
determined.

 

SECTION 11.05. _Exclusive Representations and Warranties._ Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in Articles III and IV and the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 8.02(a), none of the Seller
Entities, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Interestholder, or
their respective employees, Affiliates, members, agents or representatives,
makes or has made any representation or warranty, express or implied,
concerning the Company or any of its assets or properties or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, EXCEPT AS
OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE III OR ARTICLE IV OR SUCH
CERTIFICATE, THE COMPANY, SELLER AND THE INTERESTHOLDERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
AS TO THE CONDITION, VALUE OR QUALITY OF THE BUSINESSES OR ASSETS OF THE
COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND SELLER, THE COMPANY AND THE INTERESTHOLDERS
SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY,
USAGE, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE
ASSETS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

SECTION 11.06. _Exclusive Remedy._ If the Closing occurs, the right
to indemnification under this Article XI shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties for Losses or otherwise arising
from, in connection with or otherwise with respect to any inaccuracy in, or
breach of, any representation, warranty or certification or breach of any
covenant or agreement of the Company, any Seller Entity, any Interestholder or
Buyer, as applicable, in this Agreement, or any document delivered pursuant to
or in connection with this Agreement, other than (a) with respect to fraud,
willful concealment or willful misconduct and (b) specific enforcement of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement that are to be performed after the date
of this Agreement.

the indemnification obligation therefor terminates in accordance with Section
11.03.

SECTION 12.03. _Interpretation._ When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article or to a Section, Subsection, Exhibit, Schedule or Annex, such
reference shall be to an Article of, a Section or Subsection of, or an
Exhibit, Schedule or Annex to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or"
is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if". The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning
and effect as the word "shall". The definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms.
Any agreement, instrument or Law defined or referred to herein, in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented.
References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.
References to days means calendar days unless otherwise specified. For all
purposes set forth in this Agreement, other than with respect to Section 7.03,
the Real Property Leases shall be deemed to be operating leases and not
capital leases; _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of " _Current
Liabilities_ " in Section 1.02, the effect of Real Property Leases is excluded
pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) of such definition whether such Real
Property Leases are treated for accounting purposes as operating leases or
capital leases.

 

SECTION 12.04. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties. If any signature is
delivered by facsimile transmission 



 

59  or by PDF, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the
party executing (or on whose behalf the signature is executed) with the same
force and effect as if such facsimile or PDF signature were an original
thereof.

SECTION 12.05. _Severability._ If any term or provision of this Agreement
(or any portion thereof) or the application of such provision (or any portion
thereof) to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision hereof (or the remaining portion thereof) or the application of such
provision to any other persons or circumstances. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

SECTION 12.06. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Employment Agreements (including the documents and instruments referred to
herein or therein) (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings both written and oral, among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and (b) are not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies (other than (i) in the case of Article XI, the Indemnified
Parties, (ii) solely with respect to Section 7.09, the managers, and officers
of the Company prior to the Closing and (iii) solely with respect to Sections
12.07, 12.09 and 12.10, the Financing Sources).

SECTION 12.07. _GOVERNING LAW._ THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REGARDLESS OF
THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS
OF LAWS THEREOF.

 

SECTION 12.08. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without (a) the prior
written consent of Buyer, in the case of any assignment by the Company prior
to the Closing or in the case of any assignment by a Seller Entity or any
Interestholder at any time or (b) the Interestholder Representative, in the
case of any assignment by the Company after the Closing or in the case of an
assignment by Buyer at any time; _provided_ that without any such consent (i)
Direct Seller may assign its rights under this Agreement to Holdco or the
Interestholder Representative in connection with the dissolution of Direct
Seller after the Closing, (ii) Holdco may assign its rights under this
Agreement to the Interestholder Representative in connection with the
dissolution of Holdco after the Closing and (iii) any Interestholder
Representative may assign its right under this Agreement to any successor
Interestholder Representative. Subject to the preceding sentence, this



 

60  Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

SECTION 12.09. _Consent to Jurisdiction._ Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
New York State court sitting in the County of New York and the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (collectively, the "
_Chosen Courts_ "), for the purposes of any Litigation arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby (and
each agrees that no such Litigation relating to this Agreement shall be
brought by it or any of its Affiliates except in such courts). Each of the
parties hereto further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S.
registered mail to such PersonÂ’s respective address set forth in Section 12.02
shall be effective service of process for any Litigation in New York with
respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth
above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim) any
objection to the laying of venue of any Litigation arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the
Chosen Courts, or that any such Litigation brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

SECTION 12.10. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF ANY LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.10.

 

SECTION 12.11. _Enforcement._ The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including
specifically enforcing any partyÂ’s obligation to consummate the Closing) in
the Chosen Courts, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity.

SECTION 12.12. _Further Assurances._ Each Seller Entity, Interestholder, the
Company and Buyer agrees to execute and deliver, upon the written request of
any party hereto, any and all such further instruments and documents as
reasonably appropriate for the purpose of obtaining the full benefits of this
Agreement.

 



 

61 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of Buyer, Parent, the Company, each Seller Entity and
each Interestholder has caused this Agreement to be signed by her, him or its
officers thereunto duly authorized as of the date first written above.
