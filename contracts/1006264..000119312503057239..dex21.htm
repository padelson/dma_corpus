between the parties. Accordingly, after Closing, subject to adjustment in the

the name of Seller or any reference to Seller, to be removed from any signs
located on or about any of the Assets within 90 days of Closing. 
---|---|--- 



   4.5 | _Covenants and Agreements of Seller and Buyer_. Seller and Buyer
covenant to each other as follows: 
---|--- 


     | (a) | Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the conditions precedent set forth in Article 7, applicable to such party, to
be fulfilled and satisfied as soon as practicable by and in any event prior

---|---|--- 



     | (b) | With respect to documents required for Closing: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Seller shall commence the preparation of drafts of all
applicable schedules and exhibits to the form of Assignment and Bill of Sale

---|--- 



   5. | TITLE MATTERS. 
---|--- 



   5.1 | _Defensible Title_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The term "Defensible Title" shall mean, as to the Interests,
such title held by Seller (as to the CEP Oil and Gas Assets on Schedule A-I)
or CEI (as to the CEI Oil and Gas Assets on Schedule B-I) that: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | entitles Seller or CEI, as applicable, to receive as to each
Well set forth in Schedule A-I or B-I, not less than the "Net Revenue
Interest" set forth in Schedule A-I or B-I in the oil, gas and associated
liquid and gaseous Hydrocarbons produced, saved and marketed from that Well as
to the formations described on Schedule A-I or B-I; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | obligates Seller or CEI, as applicable, to bear costs and
expenses relating to the maintenance, development and operation of each Well
set forth on Schedule A-I or B-I in an amount not greater than the "Working
Interest" set forth in Schedule A-I or B-I as to the formations described on
Schedule A-I or B-I, without a proportionate increase in the Net Revenue
Interest; 
---|---|--- 


     | (iii) | is free from reasonable doubt, such that a willing and
reasonable prudent buyer in the business of owning and operating oil and gas
properties and with full knowledge of all relevant facts and their legal
significance would be willing to accept the title; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | is free and clear of Liens (except for Permitted
Encumbrances). 
---|---|--- 



As to the PUD locations set forth on Schedule A-I or B-I the working interest
and net revenue interest for title defect purposes shall be calculated on the
spacing unit basis set forth in Schedule A-I or B-I for that particular PUD.
For the purpose of determining Title Defects only, Seller represents and
warrants the spacing units set forth on such Schedules comply in all material
respects with applicable rules and regulations issued by any governmental
authority having jurisdiction.



     | (b) | The term "Permitted Encumbrances," as used herein, shall
mean, as follows: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | lessors royalties, overriding royalties, unitization and
pooling designations and agreements, reversionary interests and similar
burdens to the extent accounted for in the determination of the Net Revenue
Interests set forth in Schedule A-I or B-I; 
---|---|--- 



 

23 preferential purchase rights with respect to which written waivers or consents
are obtained from the appropriate parties prior to Closing or the appropriate
time period for asserting such rights has expired without an exercise of such
right; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | all rights to consent by, required notices to, filings
with, or other actions by governmental entities in connection with the sale or
conveyance of oil and gas leases or interest therein if the same are
customarily obtained subsequent to such sale or conveyance; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | easement, right-of-way, servitudes, permits, surface leases
and other rights with respect to surface operations, and pipelines, grazing,
logging, canals, ditches, reservoirs or the like as to surface interests
only; and easements for streets, alleys, highways, pipelines, telephone lines,
power lines, railways and other easements and rights-of-way, on, over or in
respect of the surface of any of the Interests, in each case that do not
operate to materially interfere with the operation of the Interests in the
manner as they have been historically operated; 
---|---|--- 





     | (v) | materialmens, mechanics, tax and other similar Liens or
charges arising in the ordinary course of business incidental to construction,
maintenance or operation of any of the Interests (i) if they have not been
filed pursuant to law, (ii) if filed, they have not yet become due and payable
or payment is being withheld as provided by law, or (iii) if their validity is
being contested in good faith in the ordinary course of business by
appropriate action; 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | Liens to be released at Closing; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | any other Liens or irregularities of any kind whatsoever
affecting the Interests of the type usual in the area and customarily waived
by a reasonably prudent operator or accepted by a reasonably prudent
purchaser, and that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect the title to or value of the
Interests, and will not prevent Buyer, as Sellers successor-in-
interest, from receiving the proceeds of production and that do not operate
to (i) reduce the Net Revenue Interest of Seller or CEI below that set forth
on Schedule A-I or B-I, (ii) increase the Working Interest of Seller or CEI
above that set forth on Schedule A-I or B-I without a proportionate increase
in the Net Revenue Interest of Seller or CEI; or (iii) materially interfere
with the operation of the Interests. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

The term "Title Defect" as used herein shall mean any defect in Sellers or
CEIs title to a Well that renders its title to the Well less than Defensible
Title. The term "Allocated Value" as used herein means the value allocated to
the Well as set forth in Schedule A-I or B-I hereto. Notwithstanding the
above, a Title Defect shall not result from a gap in the chain of title
of documents filed in any of the   

---|---|--- 



 

24  records of the BIA, BLM, any Tribe, or any other governmental depository if
an appropriate assignment is filed in the county records or is located in
the files of Seller and promptly and validly recorded by Seller after its
identification. In addition, Buyer acknowledges that certain assignments into
CEI are pending approval by the Jicarilla Apache Tribe. The lack of such
approval or the lack of approval of prior assignments shall not be the basis
for a Title Defect on such Tribal leases. 

---|--- 



   5.2 | _Cash Purchase Price Adjustments for Title Defects_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | No adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price for Title Defects
shall be made (i) for any individual Title Defect if the value of such Title
Defect is less than $25,000, and (ii) unless and until the aggregate value of
all Title Defects and Environmental Resolution Costs for Environmental Defects
that individually equal or exceed $25,000 exceeds $3,000,000, and then only to
the extent and in the amount that the aggregate value of such Title Defects
and Environmental Resolution Costs for Environmental Defects exceeds
$1,000,000. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Buyer shall give Seller written notice of Title Defects 5
days prior to the Closing Date. Such notice shall be in writing and shall
include: (i) a description of the Title Defect, (ii) the Allocated Value of
the Well affected by the Title Defect and (iii) the amount by which Buyer
believes the Allocated Value of such Well has been reduced because of such
Title Defect. Buyer agrees that Buyer shall only notify Seller of
Title Defects it believes in good faith, after reasonable investigation, are
bona fide based upon objective criteria. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Subject to the limitation contained in Section 5.2(a), Seller and Buyer shall
in good faith attempt to resolve such asserted Title Defects prior to the
Closing Date by means of the following options: (i) Buyer agrees in writing
that the Title Defect has been removed, (ii) Buyer agrees to waive the
relevant Title Defect and purchase the affected Interests notwithstanding the
defect, or (iii) Buyer and Seller agree in writing to an amount by which the
Allocated Value of the Well has been reduced and the Cash Purchase Price is
reduced by such amount in accordance with Section 2.2. If Seller and Buyer
cannot agree as to the resolution of a particular Title Defect asserted by
Buyer prior to 3 days before Closing and if the aggregate amount of all
asserted Title Defects and Environmental Defects exceeds $3,000,000, in
addition to the adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price for Title Defects for
which the parties agree as to the amount of the reduction, the Cash Purchase
Price shall also be adjusted for such disputed Title Defects in the aggregate
amount asserted by Buyer for all such unresolved Title Defects under
5.2(b)(iii) above (the "Dispute Adjustment"). After Closing, Seller and Buyer
shall continue to attempt in good faith to resolve the disputed Title Defects
and if the parties cannot reach resolution of these Defects, such Defects
shall be submitted to arbitration in the time and manner provided for in
Section 5.3 below. If any disputed Title Defect is resolved after Closing
without going to arbitration, any portion of the Dispute Adjustment
attributable to such Title Defect to which Buyer and Seller agree that the
Seller is entitled shall be paid by Buyer to Seller   

---|---|--- 



 

25  within 5 days of reaching agreement. Prior to Closing, Seller may request
that the amount of the Dispute Adjustment shall be placed in an escrow account
with an escrow agent mutually agreeable to the Parties until either resolved
by the Parties after Closing or by the arbitrator under Section 5.3. 

---|--- 



     | (d) | If there has been any downward adjustment in the Cash
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 5.2(c), and if, prior to 5 days before the
Closing Date, Seller discovers that it owns a greater net revenue interest in
a Well than the net revenue interest for such Well set forth in Exhibit A-I or
B-I hereof, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer thereof. The increase in
Allocated Value, if any (determined in a manner similar to any reduction for
a Title Defect as set forth in Section 5.2(c)), shall be a credit to Seller
against any downward adjustments to the Cash Purchase Price as a result of
agreed Title Defects asserted by Buyer. 
---|---|--- 


   5.3 | _Arbitration for Title Defects_. Any alleged Title Defects for
which the parties cannot agree on a resolution within 30 days after the
Closing Date shall be promptly submitted to binding arbitration before an oil
and gas lawyer chosen by the parties. The arbitrator shall determine the
amount by which the Allocated Value of the affected Interest is reduced, if
any, and that amount shall be paid by Seller to Buyer, or the difference in
such amount and the amount the Cash Purchase Price is adjusted under 5.2(c)
for disputed Title Defects which are submitted to arbitration shall be paid by
Buyer to Seller, as appropriate, within 5 days of the decision of the
arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be bound by the provisions of this Agreement
and shall be instructed by the parties to determine the effect of the disputed
title matter by one of the means set forth in Section 5.2(c)(iii) above.  
---|--- 



   5.4 | _Waiver of Title Defects._ Buyer shall be deemed to have waived
all Title Defects of which Seller has not been given notice by Buyer within 5
days prior to the Closing Date and all Title Defects that the parties agree
do not meet the thresholds for an adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price set
forth in Section 5.2(a). This Article 5 shall exclusively govern all
adjustments under this Agreement for title matters relating to the Interests. 
---|--- 



   5.5 | _Preferential Rights and Consents_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Some of the Leases are subject to preferential rights to
purchase in favor of third parties or third party consents to assignment and
notices of sale. The form and content of all solicitations for the waivers
and consents affecting the Interests shall be determined jointly by Seller and
Buyer but shall not be inconsistent with any of the terms of this Agreement.
Seller shall deliver such solicitations in writing to the affected third
parties as soon as practicable after the date hereof. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

In the event a third party exercises an applicable preferential right to
purchase any of the Interests prior to the Closing Date, the affected
Interests shall be removed from this Agreement and the Cash Purchase Price
shall be adjusted by the Allocated Value of the Interests. In the event such
third party fails or refuses to close on such preferential right within 60
days of the date of such third partys exercise of its preferential right,
Buyer shall purchase such affected interest   

---|---|--- 



 

26  covered by the preferential right for the Allocated Value as of the
Effective Time and the closing for such transaction shall take place on a
mutually acceptable date not more than thirty (30) days following such
failure or refusal. If any preferential right to purchase any portion of the
Interests is exercised after the Closing Date, such affected portion of the
Interests shall not be treated as a Title Defect, and no adjustment shall be
made on account of such exercise. All Interests that are subject to
preferential rights to purchase that have not been exercised as of such date
and time shall be conveyed to Buyer at the Closing. If any such preferential
right is exercised after such date and time, Buyer agrees to convey such
affected Interests to the party exercising such right on the same terms and
conditions under which Seller conveyed such Interests to Buyer. Buyer shall
retain all amounts paid by the party exercising such preferential right to
purchase. In the event of such exercise, Buyer shall prepare a form of
conveyance of such interest from Buyer to such exercising party, such
conveyance to be in form and substance as provided in this Agreement, except
that such conveyance shall be made free and clear of all liens, encumbrances,
royalty interests, production payments and other charges or defects created
by, through or under Buyer. 

---|--- 
 



   5.6 | _Casualty Loss_. If subsequent to the date of this Agreement
and, prior to the Closing, all or any material portion of the Interests to be
conveyed to Buyer at the Closing is destroyed by fire or other casualty, is
taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain or proceedings for
such purposes are pending or threatened, Buyer shall purchase such Interest
notwithstanding any such destruction, taking or pending or threatened taking
and the Cash Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the amount of all sums paid
to Seller by third parties by reason of the destruction or taking of such
Interests. Seller shall assign, transfer and set over unto Buyer all of the
right, title and interest of Seller in and to any unpaid awards or other
payment from third parties arising out of the destruction, taking or pending
or threatened taking as to such Interests. Seller shall not voluntarily
compromise, settle or adjust any material amount payable by reason of any
material destruction, taking or pending or threatened taking as to the
Interests without first obtaining the written consent of Buyer.

   9. | OBLIGATIONS AFTER CLOSING. 
---|--- 



   9.1 | _Post-Closing Adjustment Procedure_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but no later
than 90 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to
Buyer, in accordance with this Agreement and generally accepted accounting
principles, a statement (the "Final Settlement Statement") setting forth each
adjustment or payment that was not finally determined as of the Closing Date
and showing the calculation of such adjustments. Within fifteen (15) days
after receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller
a written report containing any changes that Buyer proposes be made to the
Final Settlement Statement. The parties shall undertake to agree with respect
to the amounts due pursuant to such post-closing adjustment no later than
fifteen (15) days after Seller has received Buyers proposed changes. The date
upon which such agreement is reached or upon which the "Final Cash
Purchase Price" is established, shall be called the "Final Settlement Date."
If (i) the Final Cash Purchase Price is more than the Preliminary Cash
Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay in immediately available federal funds the
amount of such difference to Seller or to Sellers account (as designated by
Seller), or (ii) the Final Cash Purchase Price is less than the Preliminary
Cash Purchase Price, Seller shall pay in immediately available federal funds
the amount of such difference to Buyer or to Buyers account (as designated
by Buyer). 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Should the parties be unable to resolve any disagreements with respect to the
Final Settlement Statement, such disagreement shall, at the earliest
practicable date, be referred, by either or both of the parties, to
PriceWaterhouseCoopers (the "Accounting Firm"), along with all audit reports,
work papers, schedules and calculations related to the matter in dispute.
Within twenty-five (25) days after such submission, the Accounting Firm shall
issue a letter report determining the Final Settlement Statement, which shall
be final and binding. Any fees and   

---|---|--- 



 

33  expenses incurred in resolving disputes shall be borne equally by Seller and
Buyer. Payment of any amounts owed under the Final Settlement Statement is
due three (3) business days from the date Seller and Buyer agree in writing
on the Final Settlement Statement, or five (5) business days from the
determination of the Final Settlement Statement by the Accounting Firm,
whichever is later. Interest will be applied at the prime rate announced from
time to time by Bank One N.A. (the "Prime Rate") to any amounts if not paid
when due from the date such payment is due. 

---|--- 


   9.2 | _Files and Records_. At the Closing (or as soon thereafter as
practicable), or as provided in the Transition Agreement, Seller shall deliver
to Buyer originals of all of Sellers files and records relating to the
Interests (in electronic or hard-copy form, as the case may be), along with an
inventory of same. Seller may retain copies of any records or data (i)
necessary for Seller to discharge its post-closing responsibilities under
Section 9.3 or (ii) necessary for Seller to respond to Title or Environmental
Defects. After Closing Buyer shall make available for Seller, including
sending a copy of the file to Seller along with the notice of the defect
if convenient for both parties, any files or records reasonably required by
Seller to research or respond to Title or Environmental Defects. Buyer shall
retain and make available to Seller as needed for three full calendar years
following the Closing Date, in Buyers office during normal business hours,
files and records relating to the Interests. Seller shall retain division
order files until the last day of the month for which Seller retains
disbursement responsibilities.  
---|--- 



   9.3 | _Post Closing Administrative Accounting Responsibilities_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Seller shall undertake the obligations set forth in the
Transition Agreement (delivered pursuant to Section 8.3(i)). 
---|---|--- 


     | (b) | Seller acknowledges that, in order to comply with
requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Buyer may need to engage independent public accountants (the
"PA") to conduct an audit and provide an audit opinion in accordance with
generally accepted auditing principles in the United States of historical
financial statements derived for the business representing the
Assets (excluding the Excluded Assets) (collectively, the "Audited Financial
Statements"). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller
shall provide such access to its books and records, and shall otherwise
provide whatever other assistance is reasonably necessary (including, but not
limited to, executing appropriate and reasonable representation letters to the
PA), to enable Buyer and the PA to prepare and audit the Audited Financial
Statements within 75 days of the Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Seller covenants to deliver to Buyer, within thirty (30) days after Closing,
in a mutually agreeable electronic format, the following information with
respect to all funds which Seller is holding as of the Closing Date that are
owing to third party owners of royalty, overriding royalty, or working
interests in respect of past production of Hydrocarbons attributable to the
Interests (referred to herein as "Suspense Accounts"): owner name, owner
number, owner social security number   

---|---|--- 



 

34  (if known to Seller), reason for suspense, and the amount of suspense funds
payable for each entry, together with monthly line item production detail for
all suspense entries. Buyer shall assume all responsibility and liability for
the Suspense Accounts. 

---|--- 



     | (d) | Promptly after Closing, Seller shall prepare and present to
Buyer for review and approval the form of transfer orders or letters in lieu
and associated exhibits thereof in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer
("Letters in Lieu"). Prior to December 31, 2003, Seller and Buyer shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver transfer orders or Letters in Lieu thereof
directing purchasers of production to make payment to Buyer of proceeds
attributable to production from the Interests assigned to Buyer. 
---|---|--- 



   9.4 | _Further Assurances_. Each party shall, from time to time at the
request of the other, and without further consideration, execute and deliver
such other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment,
clarification and termination and take such other action as the party making
the request may require to effectuate the intentions of the parties, including
those required to sell, transfer, convey and assign to, and vest in Buyer,
and to place Buyer in possession of the Assets. Seller intends to convey the
Assets at Closing; however, in the event it is determined after Closing that:
(i) any part of the Assets was not in fact conveyed to Buyer, and that the
title to any part of the Assets is incorrectly in the name of Seller; (ii) any
Excluded Asset is conveyed to Buyer and that the title to such Excluded Asset
is incorrectly in the name of Buyer; then each party shall take all such
action necessary to correctly convey any part of Assets to Buyer, or any part
of the Excluded Assets to Seller. 
---|--- 



   9.5 | _Assumption of Obligations_.

     | (a) | IF CLOSING OCCURS, BUYER SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AND SHALL

IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTY REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, THE RELEASE OF
MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING NATURALLY OCCURRING
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL, OR PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT OR HEALTH AND SAFETY,

SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE REAL OR IMMOVABLE PROPERTY, PERSONAL OR
MOVABLE PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY, MACHINERY AND FIXTURES SHALL
BE CONVEYED TO BUYER AS IS AND IN THEIR PRESENT CONDITION AND STATE OF
REPAIR. 

---|--- 



     | (d) | SELLER HEREBY EXPRESSLY NEGATES AND DISCLAIMS, AND
BUYER HEREBY WAIVES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH
IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER HAS NOT MADE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO (i) THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR MATERIALITY

SELLER SHALL INDEMNIFY EACH OTHER AS FOLLOWS: 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

For 6 months after the Closing Date, SELLER, EnCap Energy Capital Fund III,
L.P., EnCap Energy Acquisition III-B, Inc., ECIC Corporation, and BOCP Energy

HOLD HARMLESS BUYER, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS, AGAINST
ALL LOSSES, DAMAGES, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES, LIABILITIES AND
SANCTIONS OF EVERY KIND AND CHARACTER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES, COURT COSTS AND COSTS OF INVESTIGATION, WHICH
ARISE FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH (I) ANY BREACH BY SELLER OF THIS AGREEMENT
(OTHER THAN SECTION 3.1(bb)) OR (II) THE EXCLUDED LIABILITIES. Regarding
environmental matters, the indemnity shall only apply to and cover third party
claims only to the extent that all losses, damages, costs, liabilities,
obligations and expenses suffered by Buyer as a result of each such claim
exceeds $25,000 net to Sellers interest and only if, when taken in
conjunction with any qualifying Environmental Defects for which
Buyer notified Seller pursuant to Article 6 and any Title Defects for which
Buyer notified Seller pursuant to Article 5, the aggregate of all losses,
damages, costs, liabilities, obligations and expenses suffered by Buyer as a
result thereof exceed $3,000,000 and then only to the extent of the excess
over $1,000,000. Except for title matters (which are governed exclusively by
Article 5) and environmental matters (which are governed by the preceding
sentence and the provisions of Article 6), Sellers indemnity obligation in
this paragraph 9.6(a) shall be applicable to the extent that, and only to the
extent that, the aggregate of all   

---|---|--- 



 

36  losses, damages, costs, liabilities, obligations and expenses suffered by
Buyer and attributable to Seller under this paragraph, exclusive of legal
fees, exceed $1,000,000 (the "Indemnity Threshold"). Buyer shall assume all
losses, damages, costs, liabilities, and obligations of Seller under this
indemnity provision up to $1,000,000 and all legal fees associated with or
resulting from such matters. This assumption obligation of Buyer is in
addition to the deductibles established under this Agreement for Title Defects
and Environmental Defects that Buyer also assumes. The maximum liability of
Seller and EnCap Energy Capital Fund III, L.P., EnCap Energy Acquisition
III-B, Inc., ECIC Corporation, and BOCP Energy Partners, L.P., a Texas limited
partnership under this Section 9.6(a) shall not exceed $10,000,000. 

---|--- 


     | (b) | BUYER SHALL DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND SAVE AND HOLD HARMLESS
SELLER, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS AGAINST ALL
LOSSES, DAMAGES, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES, LIABILITIES AND
SANCTIONS OF EVERY KIND AND CHARACTER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES, COURT COSTS AND COSTS OF INVESTIGATION, WHICH
ARISE FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH (I) ANY BREACH BY BUYER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
(II) THE ASSUMED LIABILITIES. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Subject to Section 9.12, Buyer shall have no obligation with
respect to any liability under Environmental Law arising (i) from Sellers
intentionally unlawful, or grossly negligent, acts or omissions or (ii) from
Sellers transportation, treatment, storage, disposal or release offsite from
the Lands, prior to the Effective Time, of any material, substance or waste
listed, regulated or defined under any Environmental Law, other than and not
including produced water, used drilling muds, and any other materials covered
by and included within the exemption of oil and gas exploration and production
wastes from federal hazardous waste regulations under the Resource Recovery
and Conservation Act, as amended, transported to or disposed of at a facility
or site of a third party which had all necessary permits to receive such
water, muds and materials at the time of such transportation or disposal.  
---|---|--- 



   9.7 | _Method of Asserting Claims, Etc_. All claims for
indemnification under this Article 9 shall be asserted and resolved as follows
provided that the provisions of Sections 9.7 through 9.9 shall be covenants
and not conditions to the defense and indemnity obligations to which they
apply: 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

_Third Party Claims_. In the event that any claim for which a party providing
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") would be liable to the other party
or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives
entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") is asserted
against or sought to be collected by a third person (referred to herein as
a "Third Party Claim"; provided that the term "Third Party Claim" shall not
include any valid invoices or joint interest billings related to the Interests
for services performed and actually received by Seller prior to the Effective
Time), the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of
such claim, specifying the nature of   

---|---|--- 



 

37  such claim and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then
feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of
such claim) (the "Claim Notice"). The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty
(30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify
the Indemnified Party: 

---|--- 


     | (i) | whether or not it disputes its liability to the Indemnified
Party hereunder with respect to such claim; and 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | if it does not dispute such liability, whether or not it
desires, at its sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party against
such claim; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party is hereby
authorized prior to and during the Notice Period to file any motion, answer or
other pleading, submission or document which it shall deem necessary or
appropriate to protect its interests. 
---|---|--- 


In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
Party within the Notice Period that it does not dispute such liability and
desires to defend against such claim or demand, then, except as hereinafter
provided, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such claim or
demand by appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be promptly
settled or prosecuted to a final conclusion, in such a manner as to avoid any
risk of the Indemnified Party becoming subject to liability. If the
Indemnified Party desires to participate in, but not control, any such
defense or settlement, it may do so at its own cost and expense. If the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to such claim, or
elects not to defend against such claim, whether by not giving timely notice
as provided above or otherwise, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
but not the obligation to defend against such claim, and the amount of any
such claim, or if the same be contested by the Indemnifying Party or by the
Indemnified Party, then that portion thereof as to which such defense is
unsuccessful, shall be conclusively deemed to be a liability of the
Indemnifying Party hereunder (subject, if it has timely disputed liability, to
a determination in accordance with Section 9.9 that the disputed liability is
covered by this Article 9.)



     | (b) | _Other Claims_. In the event that the Indemnified Party
shall have a claim against the Indemnifying Party hereunder which does not
involve a claim or demand being asserted against or sought to be collected
from it by a third person, the Indemnified Party shall promptly send a Claim
Notice with respect to such claim to the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within the Notice
Period that it disputes such claim, the amount of such claim shall be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder. 
---|---|--- 



    9.8 | _Payment_. Payments under this Article 9 and under any other
indemnity provision of the Agreement (other than Section 4.3(b)) shall be made
as follows:  
---|--- 



     | (a) |

_Payment of Undisputed Amount_. In the event that the Indemnifying Party is
required to make any payment under this Article 9, the Indemnifying Party
shall promptly pay the Indemnified Party the amount so determined. If there
should be   

---|---|--- 



 

38  a dispute as to the amount or manner of determination of any indemnity
obligation owed under this Article 9, the Indemnifying Party shall
nevertheless pay when due such portion, if any, of the obligation as shall
not be subject to dispute. The difference, if any, between the amount of the
obligation ultimately determined as properly payable under this Article 9 and
the portion, if any theretofore paid, shall bear interest at the Prime Rate.
Upon the payment in full of any claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to the rights of the Indemnified Party against any person or other
entity with respect to the subject matter of such claim. 

---|--- 



     | (b) | _Interest_. If all or part of any indemnification
obligation under the Agreement is not paid when due upon resolution of the
claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall pay on demand to the Indemnified
Party interest at the Prime Rate on the unpaid amount of the obligation for
each day from the date the amount became due until payment in full. 
---|---|--- 



   9.9 | _Disputed Claims_. If the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party during the Notice Period that it disputes any claim under
Section 9.7 (the "Disputed Claim"), the Disputed Claim shall be subject to
the dispute resolution procedures pursuant to Section 11.17. 
---|--- 



   9.10 | _Applicability of Article 9_. This Article 9 does not apply to
Tax matters (which are covered by Section 4.3(b)). 
---|--- 


   9.11 | _Confidentiality_. For a period of six months, Seller covenants
and agrees that Seller and its officers and directors shall hold in
confidence, and shall not use to the detriment of Buyer, any proprietary data
or proprietary information with respect to the Interests or the business of
Buyer obtained in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Seller shall inform each of its officers and directors
of such obligation, and shall cause such persons to comply with such
obligation. Proprietary information and proprietary data shall not include
information or data that (a) is in the public domain as of the Effective
Time or (b) lawfully enters the public domain through no violation of this
Agreement after disclosure to Buyer. 
---|--- 



   9.12 |

_Benefit and Obligation Cut-Off_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, after March 31, 2004, excluding claims that have
been asserted by Buyer or Seller prior to that date in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement (which such claims shall continue to be governed by
the other terms of this Agreement): (i) Buyer shall have no further recourse
against Seller or Seller Investor Parties, and their respective officers,
directors, affiliates or employees, regarding costs, liabilities, and
obligations, of any kind or nature, relating to the Assets and all such
matters shall be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities hereunder, and (ii) all
proceeds of production, refunds, or other income from the Assets that are
received by Buyer or Seller whether attributable to the period of time before
or after the Effective Time shall be the property of Buyer. If
Closing occurs, but is delayed after October 1, 2003, as a result of a delay
requested by Seller or an order is entered under Section 7.2(b) that delays
consummation of this   

---|--- 



 

39  transaction, the provisions of this paragraph shall be effective as of the
day that is 6 months from the actual Closing Date rather than March 31,
2004.

   10. | TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. 
---|--- 



   10.1 | _Termination_. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby may be terminated in the following instances:

are not satisfied or waived as of the Closing Date.

hereunder of any nature whatsoever to, including any liability for damages

---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If Seller terminates this Agreement because of a failure by
Buyer to satisfy Buyers obligations to close in Section 7.1(a) or an order is
entered under Section 7.1(b) that prohibits consummation of this transaction,
(and Seller has satisfied its obligations to close in Section 7.2), Buyer
shall be obligated to pay to Seller within (10) business days thereafter the
sum of $10,000,000 in cash as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty. If
this sum is paid, Seller shall not have the right to enforce specific
performance of this Agreement by Buyer. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | If Buyer terminates this Agreement because of a failure of
Seller to satisfy Sellers obligations to close in Section 7.2(a) or an order
is entered under Section 7.2(b) that prohibits consummation of this
transaction, (and Buyer has satisfied its obligations to close in 7.1), Buyer
shall have the right to enforce specific performance of this Agreement by
Seller, or exercise any other right or remedy it may have at law or in
equity.

Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, before Closing to
interview the Sellers employees working out of the Farmington and/or Hinton
Field Offices (the "Field Employees") and to make offers to one or more of

similarly situated employees of Buyer including, without limitation, (i) the
right to participate in any employee benefit plans, and (ii) the right to
participate in group health insurance without, if possible under the terms of
such plans, any waiting period and, if practicable, without exclusion or
limitation based on pre-existing conditions. Buyer will give all such
employees full credit, for purposes of eligibility and vesting, if possible
under the terms of such plans, for such employees service with the
Company and shall not reduce any employees benefits (such as days of
vacation) below the level of current benefits. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | In the case of each Continuing Employee, Buyer will either
(i) pay such employee an amount in cash equal to the amount set forth next to

   11.5 | _Amendments_. This Agreement may not be amended nor any rights
hereunder waived except by an instrument in writing signed by the party to be
charged with such amendment or waiver and delivered by such party to the
party claiming the benefit of such amendment or waiver. 
---|--- 



   11.6 | _Assignment_. Neither party may assign all or any portion of
its rights or delegate all or any portion of its duties hereunder unless it

and obtains the prior written consent of the other party. 
---|--- 



   11.7 | [Reserved]. 
---|--- 



   11.8 | _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by Buyer and
Seller in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original instrument, but all of which together shall constitute but one and
the same instrument. 
---|--- 



   11.9 | _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the
laws of the State of Texas, but without regard to laws or principles of
conflicts of laws that would cause application of the laws of another
jurisdiction. The parties hereby consent to the exclusive venue of the proper
state or federal court located in Denver County, Colorado, and hereby waive
all other venues. 
---|--- 



   11.10 | _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules
hereto) constitutes the entire understanding among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, superseding all negotiations, prior discussions
and prior agreements and understandings relating to such subject matter. 
---|--- 



 

42 upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto, and their
respective successors and assigns, and nothing contained in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person or entity any
benefits, rights or remedies. 
---|--- 



   11.12 | _Survival_. The covenants, agreements, representations and
indemnities provided for in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall
not be extinguished by the doctrine of merger by deed or any similar doctrine
and no waiver, release, or forbearance of the application of the provisions of
those paragraphs in any given circumstance shall operate as a waiver, release,
or forbearance of the provisions of the paragraphs as to any other
circumstance. Notwithstanding the above, the representations of Seller set
forth in Article 3 shall only survive Closing for a period of six months,
other than those set forth in Section 3.1(bb), which shall not survive the
date that is five days prior to the Closing Date. The indemnities provided for
in this Agreement are intended, among other things, to release and indemnify
the indemnitee from and against the indemnitees negligence, strict
liability, and statutory liability with respect to the matters covered by
such indemnities. 
---|--- 



   11.13 | _Liability and Jury Waivers_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | LIMITATION ON LIABILITY. NO PARTY SHALL BE REQUIRED TO PAY
OR BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR INDIRECT
DAMAGES (WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM ITS NEGLIGENCE) TO ANY OTHER PARTY
REGARDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR A CLAIM OF BREACH
HEREOF. THIS PROVISION SHALL NOT DIMINISH OR AFFECT IN ANY WAY THE PARTIES
RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS UNDER ANY INDEMNITIES PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. 
---|---|--- 



   11.14 | _Press Release_. Prior to Closing and for a period of 30 days
following Closing, neither party shall make any press release or other
announcement in connection with this Agreement without first consulting with
the other party. Following such consultation and good faith attempt to make
reasonable accommodations, either party may make any announcement or press
release that it believes is either required by applicable law or the rules of
any stock exchange, or is advisable in connection with such partys obligation
to provide public disclosure regarding its activities. This provision shall
not apply to any filing with any governmental body or stock exchange required
by law, rule or regulation. 
---|--- 



   11.15 |

_Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in   

---|--- 



 

43  any adverse manner to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible. 

---|--- 



   11.16 | _Enforcement_. Except as provided in Section 10.2(b), should
Buyer or Seller default in the performance of this Agreement, the non-
defaulting party shall be entitled to enforce specific performance of this
Agreement, or exercise any other right or remedy it may have at law or in
equity by reason of such default. 
---|--- 



   11.17 | _Dispute Resolution_. Except as hereinafter provided in this
Section 11.17, all claims, controversies, differences, or disputes between or
among the parties arising from or relating to this Agreement, including
claims by one party that the other party has failed to perform any of its
obligations hereunder (collectively, "Agreement Disputes"), shall be resolved
as follows: 
---|--- 


     | (a) | _Mediation_. The parties shall first attempt to resolve an
Agreement Dispute by means of a facilitative mediation conducted in the
following manner. The party desiring mediation of any Agreement Dispute shall
give or shall have given a written notice (a "Dispute Notice") to the other
Party setting forth the nature of the dispute and the relief intended to be
sought and shall submit such Agreement Dispute for resolution by mediation in
the City and County of Denver, Colorado, under the process and procedure
generally applicable to cases submitted to facilitative mediation in the City
and County of Denver, Colorado, in effect on the date of this Agreement,
unless the parties have agreed, in writing, to resolve any such dispute by
other means. Each party agrees that it will submit to and shall not challenge
or object to the jurisdiction (either personal or subject matter) or the venue
of such mediation in the City and County of Denver, Colorado. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | _Legal Proceedings_. If any Agreement Dispute has not been
resolved by mediation as provided above within sixty (60) days after
submission thereof, then either party may commence a suit or legal action or
an action at equity to enforce its rights or the other partys obligations or
recover any damages arising from the other partys breach or such other relief
as may be appropriate under the circumstances in accordance with the
provisions regarding jurisdiction and venue set forth in Section 11.9 of this
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | _Attorney Fees and Other Costs_. Each party shall pay its
own fees and disbursements of its attorneys, accountants, and expert witnesses
in connection with any mediation or any action or legal or other proceeding
brought with respect to an Agreement Dispute brought in accordance with the
provisions hereof. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

_Exceptions for Equitable Relief_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, a party may bring
a proceeding against the other party for specific performance or injunctive
or other forms or   

---|---|--- 



 

44  equitable relief in the courts designated in Section 11.9 of this Agreement
without having to submit the matter or Agreement Dispute in question to
mediation as hereinabove set forth, provided, however, that such party shall
not seek any monetary award or relief in such action or proceeding unless its
failure to do so would prejudice such partys rights or ability to seek such
monetary award or relief in another action or proceeding. 

---|--- 



   11.18 | _Allocated Values_. The allocated values for the Interests set
forth on Schedules A-I and B-I (the "Allocated Values") are intended to comply
with the allocation method required by Section 1060 of the Code. Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate to comply with all substantive and procedural
requirements of Section 1060 and the regulations thereunder, including the
filing by Buyer and Seller of form 8594 with their federal income tax returns
for the taxable year in which Closing occurs. Seller and Buyer agree that each
will not take for income tax purposes any position inconsistent with the
allocation of the Cash Purchase Price as set forth in this paragraph. 
---|--- 



   11.19 | _TEXAS DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES ACT_. SELLER AND BUYER
CERTIFY THAT THEY ARE NOT "CONSUMERS" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE TEXAS
DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES-CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, SUBCHAPTER E OF CHAPTER

AMENDED (THE "DTPA"). THE PARTIES COVENANT, FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR AND IN
BEHALF OF ANY SUCCESSOR OR ASSIGNEE, THAT, IF THE DTPA IS APPLICABLE, (I) THE
PARTIES ARE "BUSINESS CONSUMERS" THEREUNDER, (II) EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES AND
RELEASES ALL OF ITS RIGHTS AND REMEDIES THEREUNDER (OTHER THAN SECTION 17.555,
TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE) AS APPLICABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY AND ITS
SUCCESSORS, AND (III) EACH PARTY SHALL DEFEND AND INDEMNIFY THE OTHER FROM AND
AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, OR CAUSES OF ACTION OF OR BY THAT PARTY
OR ANY SUCCESSOR OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES BASED IN WHOLE OR IN PART ON THE
DTPA, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT. 
---|--- 



   11.20 |

_Certain Governmental Consents_. At the Closing, Seller shall execute and
deliver to Buyer such assignments of Federal, state and Indian leases
as require consent to assignment, on the forms required by the governmental
agency having jurisdiction thereof. Seller and Buyer will use all reasonable
efforts after Closing to obtain approval of such assignments. Until such
approvals are obtained, Seller shall continue to hold record title to such
leases, to the extent Seller is currently record title holder, as nominee for
Buyer, during which time (i) Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless
from any and all claims, suits, obligations, liabilities, losses, costs and
expenses of any kind or character relating to such leases, except for
liabilities for which Seller is otherwise responsible hereunder and (ii)
Seller shall act as Buyers nominee but shall be authorized to act only upon
