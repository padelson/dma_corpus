    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of March 31, 2006 (this "Agreement"), among Iconix Brand Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Acquisition Co."), Moss Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquisition Co. ("Acquisition Sub"), Mossimo, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), and Mossimo Giannulli, the majority stockholder of Company ("Parent").

  

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

  

 WHEREAS, Company together with its Subsidiary (as defined in Section 2.3) is in the business of, among other things, designing and licensing apparel and related products under Company and its SubsidiaryÂ’s brands (the "Business"); and 

  

 WHEREAS, Acquisition Co. desires to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Company; and

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Acquisition Co., the Board of Directors of Acquisition Sub, Acquisition Co. as the sole stockholder of Acquisition Sub, the Board of Directors of Company, and Parent, for himself and as the holder of a majority of the outstanding capital stock of Company, have: (a) determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies for Company to be merged with and into Acquisition Sub upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and (b) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of Company with and into Acquisition Sub (the "Merger") in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law" or "DGCL"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

  

 WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, Acquisition Co., Acquisition Sub, Company and Parent intend that the Merger qualify as a reorganization within the definition of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:

  

 1.  _Basic Transaction_.

  

 1.1.  _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2), and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and under Delaware Law, Company shall be merged with and into Acquisition Sub, the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease, and Acquisition Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation, operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquisition Co. From and after the Effective Time, Acquisition Sub shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Company. The Merger shall have the effects specified in Section 259 of the DGCL. Acquisition Sub, as the surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation." The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Mossimo, Inc." 1.2.  _Effective Time_. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than two days, after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 5, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the transactions contemplated herein shall have been abandoned pursuant to Section 7.1, Acquisition Sub and Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in the form of _Exhibit A_ and making such other filings as may be required by Delaware Law, in such form as required by and executed in accordance with such law (the time of the last of such filings to be made being the "Effective Time").

  

 1.3.  _Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (a) The aggregate consideration to be paid by Acquisition Co. in the Merger (the "Merger Consideration") shall be the sum of (i) the Initial Merger Consideration (as defined below) and (ii) the Additional Merger Consideration (as defined below), if any. The "Initial Merger Consideration" shall be the product of (A) $7.50 multiplied by (B) the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shall be paid as follows: (x) the issuance of 0.2271139 shares of Acquisition Co. common stock, $.001 par value (the "Acquisition Co. Common Stock"), for each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, based on $3.25 per share of Company Common Stock divided by $14.31, which is the average closing sales price of Acquisition Co. Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ National Market for the three (3) business days ending on the date hereof (the "Acquisition Co. Initial Sale Price") (the "Common Stock Consideration"); and (ii) cash in the amount of $4.25 per share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time minus the Adjustment Amount (as defined below). The "Adjustment Amount" is an amount equal to the Cash Consideration (as defined below) divided by the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. The "Cash Consideration" is an amount equal to $4.25 multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, minus an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the Adjusted Cash Balance (as defined below) of Company at the Closing (as defined in Section 6 hereof), less the Option Payments, if any, to be made pursuant to Section 1.4 below, is less than $17,000,000. "Adjusted Cash Balance" means (A) the sum, as of the Closing, of CompanyÂ’s cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, royalties receivable, prepaid expenses and inventory, less (B) CompanyÂ’s accounts payable, the payment due to Target Corporation under paragraph 5.3 of the TBI License (as defined in Section 2.5 below) and other accrued payables, all measured in accordance with U.S. GAAP (as defined in Section 2.6 below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Common Stock Consideration is subject to reduction as set forth in Section 1.3(d) below. To the extent that Company Options are exercised during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Interim Period Option Exercises"), increasing the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding, then the proceeds of all Interim Period Option Exercises (the "Option Proceeds") shall be held by the Company in a separate account of the Company until immediately after the Closing, and the amount of Option Proceeds shall not be included for purposes of determining the Adjusted Cash Balance.

   (b)  In the event that the closing sales price of Acquisition Co. Common Stock does  not equal or exceed the Target Price (as defined below) during each day of any  twenty (20) consecutive trading day period during the twelve (12) month period  following the Closing (such twelve (12) month period being hereinafter referred  to as the "Measurement Period"), Acquisition Co. will issue, within  twenty (20) business days after the end of the Measurement Period, or if later,  twenty (20) business days following the resolution pursuant to Section 1.9(m)  of any disagreement in respect of the number of shares to be issued to the Exchange  Agent (as defined below) for the benefit of each holder of Company Common Stock  entitled to Merger Consideration hereunder an additional number of shares of  Acquisition Co. Common Stock equal to a number obtained by dividing (i) the  product of (A) the number of shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock issued to  such holder of Company Common Stock on the Closing multiplied by (B) the difference  between (x) the Target Price and (y) the greater of (I) the average of the highest  closing sale price of Acquisition Co. Common Stock over any twenty (20) consecutive  trading day period during the Measurement Period and (II) the average closing  sales price of Acquisition Co. Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ National  Market for the three (3) business days prior to Closing (the "Acquisition  Co. Average Closing Price") (the higher stock price in this clause (y)  is referred to as the "Actual Price"), by (ii) the Actual Price (the  "Additional Merger Consideration"). The "Target Price" shall  be defined to mean $18.71, which is 130.76923% of the Acquisition Co. Initial  Sale Price. In the event that the closing sales price of Acquisition Co.Â’s  Common Stock equals or exceeds the Target Price during the Measurement Period,  Acquisition Co. shall not be required to issue any Additional Merger Consideration.  The right of each holder of Company Common Stock and Company Options to receive  Additional Merger Consideration will be evidenced by a non-transferable contingent  share right (each, a "Contingent Share Right" and collectively, the  "Contingent Share Rights") to be issued to the Exchange Agent for  the benefit of the holders of Common Stock and Company Options in accordance  with Section 1.9 of this Agreement. Acquisition Co. shall also pay to each holder  of a Company Option that was cancelled pursuant to Section 1.4 below the cash  value of the Additional Merger Consideration such holder would have received  if such holder had exercised his or her Company Options prior to the Effective  Time, less any applicable tax withholding.

  

 (c) During the Measurement Period, if there is an acquisition or consolidation of Acquisition Co. in which the stockholders of Acquisition Co. are not at least a majority of the stockholders of the surviving entity, or a sale, conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of Acquisition Co., and (i) the per share purchase price of Acquisition Co. or (ii) the aggregate consideration paid for the assets of Acquisition Co. divided by the number of shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock outstanding on the closing date of such asset sale ((i) or (ii), as applicable, the "Measurement Price") is less than the Target Price, the Additional Merger Consideration shall become payable within twenty (20) business days following the closing of such acquisition, transfer, consolidation or sale, and the Measurement Price shall be deemed the Actual Price for purposes of calculating the Additional Merger Consideration payable to holders of Common Stock.

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.3, if the Acquisition Co. Average Closing Price equals or exceeds the Maximum Share Price

   (as defined below), which is the Maximum Stock Consideration Percentage (as
defined below) of the Acquisition Co. Initial Sale Price, then in such case
the number of shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock issuable as Common Stock
Consideration as part of the Initial Merger Consideration shall be determined
by dividing the Maximum Stock Consideration (as defined below) by the
Acquisition Co. Average Closing Price, in lieu of the formula set forth in
Section 1.3(a)(ii)(B)(x). Furthermore, Acquisition Co. may, at its sole
option, elect to pay any portion of the Initial Merger Consideration which is
in excess of $135,147,866 in either cash or stock, provided that in no event
shall the cash portion of the total Merger Consideration payable exceed 60%
of the total Merger Consideration paid under this Agreement, and in the event
that Acquisition Co. exercises its option to pay any such excess in cash or
stock, an appropriate corresponding adjustment shall accordingly be made to
the per share amounts of stock and cash, as the case may be, payable by
Acquisition Co. as Merger Consideration hereunder. For purposes hereof, (I)
the "Maximum Share Price" shall be equal to the Acquisition Co. Initial Sale
Price multiplied by the Maximum Stock Consideration Percentage; (II) the
"Maximum Stock Consideration Percentage" shall be equal to the amount of the
Maximum Stock Consideration divided by the number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding at the Closing, with the result thereof divided by $3.25;
and (III) the "Maximum Stock Consideration" shall be $150,000,000 reduced by
the amount of Cash Consideration, and further reduced, if applicable, by the
amount by which the Adjusted Cash Balance at the Closing, less the Option
Payments, if any, to be made pursuant to Section 1.4 below, is less than
$17,000,000.

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.3, in no event shall the number of shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock that Acquisition Co. is required to issue as Common Stock Consideration and/or Additional Merger Consideration under this Agreement exceed 19.99% of the total issued and outstanding shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock at the date of Closing or at the end of the Measurement Period. Any shares required to be issued hereunder as Initial Merger Consideration and/or Additional Merger Consideration in excess of 19.99% of the total issued and outstanding shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock on the applicable date, shall be paid in cash and shall be valued at the Acquisition Co. Average Closing Price with respect to shares issued as the Initial Merger Consideration and at the Actual Price with respect to shares issued as the Additional Merger Consideration. In addition, any shares issued as Additional Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect any stock dividend, stock split, subdivision, combination, reclassification or similar transaction in respect of the Acquisition Co. Common Stock.

  

 1.4.  _Option Treatment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to provide that immediately prior to the Effective Time, but subject to the Effective Time occurring, each unexpired and unexercised option, whether vested or unvested, to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (as defined in Section 2.2 hereof) under any stock option plan of Company (collectively, the "Company Plan Options") including but not limited to the Company 1995 Stock Option Plan, and the 1995 Company Non-Employee DirectorÂ’s Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "Company Option Plans") and each other option, warrant or similar right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (collectively, the "Company Non-Plan Options" and together with the Company Plan Options, the "Company Options") set forth on Schedule 2.2, without regard to whether such

   option is then exercisable, shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor,
each former holder of any cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to
receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and in
settlement therefor, a payment in cash (subject to any applicable withholding
or other taxes required by applicable law to be withheld) of an amount equal
to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously subject to such Company Options and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Per Share Amount (as defined below) over the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock previously subject to such option plus, if applicable,
the per share cash value of the Additional Merger Consideration such holder
would have received if such holder had exercised his or her Company Options
prior to the Effective Time, less any applicable tax withholding (such
amounts payable hereunder being referred to collectively as the "Option
Payments"). From and after the Effective Time, any such cancelled Company
Options shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but
shall only entitle such holder, subject to receipt by the Exchange Agent (as
defined in Section 1.9(a)) of the surrendered Company Option
agreement, together with a written instrument, reasonably satisfactory to
Acquisition Co., duly executed by the holder of such Company Option,
representing that (i) he, she or it is the owner of all Company Options
represented by such Company Option agreement and (ii) a confirmation of, and
consent to, the cancellation of all of his, her or its Options, to the
payment of the applicable Option Payments. After the Effective Time, all
Company Option Plans shall be terminated and no further or other rights with
respect to shares of Company Common Stock shall be granted thereunder. The
"Per Share Amount" shall be $7.50, subject to the per share amount of any
reduction pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.3(a) in the Cash
Consideration. As provided in Section 1.3(a), if the Additional Merger
Consideration is payable to holders of Company Common Stock, then upon the
determination such payment is due, Acquisition Co. shall pay, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay, to each holder of a Company Option cancelled
pursuant to this Agreement who was entitled to a payment pursuant to this
Section 1.4, a payment equal to the amount of Additional Merger consideration
he or she would have received if such holder had exercised his or her Company
Options prior to the Effective Time, less any applicable tax withholding.

  

 1.5.  _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the rights, privileges, powers, franchises and all property (real, personal and mixed) of Company and all debts due Company shall vest in Acquisition Sub, and all debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of Company shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of Acquisition Sub.

  

 1.6.  _Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws_.

  

 (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of Acquisition Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (annexed hereto as _Exhibit B_ ), shall remain the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, except that the Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended to change the name of the Surviving Corporation to "Mossimo, Inc."

   (b) The By-Laws of Acquisition Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (annexed hereto as _Exhibit C_ ), shall remain the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

 1.7.  _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_.

  

 (a) The sole director of Acquisition Sub shall, at the Effective Time, be the duly appointed sole director of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office in accordance with applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until resignation, removal or replacement.

  

 (b) The President and such other officers of Acquisition Sub shall, at the Effective Time, be duly nominated and appointed as President and to such other offices to which such other officers are appointed, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation, and shall constitute the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case to serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation until his respective resignation, removal or replacement.

---|--- 
   



  |  

 (i)  each share of common stock of Acquisition Sub, par value, $.01 per share,  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain  outstanding and shall represent one (1) share of common stock of the  Surviving Corporation, par value $.01, per share.

   
   



  |  



   
   



  |  

 (ii)  (a) each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.10  below) and shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury) shall be  converted into the right to receive (i) the number of shares of Acquisition  Co. Common Stock obtained by dividing the Common Stock Consideration by the  number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time, rounded, with respect to each Company  stockholder to the nearest whole share of Acquisition Co. Common Stock, (ii)  the amount of cash (without interest) determined by dividing the Cash  Consideration by the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, rounded, with respect to  each Company stockholder to the nearest cent, subject to any withholding set  forth in Section 1.9(c) below and (iii) a proportionate share of the  Additional Merger Consideration, if any, determined by dividing the  Additional Merger Consideration by the number of shares of Company Common  Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,  rounded, with respect to each Company stockholder to the 

   
      |  



   
---|--- 
   



  |  

nearest whole  share of Acquisition Co. Common Stock; (b) each Dissenting
Share shall be  converted into the right to receive payment in accordance
with the provisions  of the DGCL and Section 1.10 below and (c) each share of
Company Common Stock  held in treasury shall be cancelled. All shares of
Company Common Stock, when  so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be  cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a  certificate representing any such shares shall cease to
have any rights with  respect thereto, except the right to receive (A) the
cash and certificates  representing the shares of Acquisition Co. Common
Stock into which such  shares are converted and (B) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of  Acquisition Co. Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor  upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with
this Section 1.8,  without interest.

   
   



  |  



   
   



  |  

 (iii)  any shares of Company Common Stock issued and owned by Company, Acquisition  Co. or Acquisition Sub immediately preceding the Effective Time shall be  cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no payment shall be made  with respect thereto.

   
   

 (b) No rights to receive fractional shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock shall arise under this Agreement. No fractional shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof, each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled thereto upon the surrender of a Company Certificate (as defined in Section 1.9(a)) for exchange pursuant to this Section 1.8 will be paid an amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying (i) the per share closing price on NASDAQ of Acquisition Co. Common Stock (as reported by NASDAQ) on the first date of trading in Acquisition Co. Common Stock on NASDAQ after the Effective Time) by (ii) the fractional share to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.

  

 1.9.  _Exchange of Company Certificates_.

  

 (a) Acquisition Co. shall authorize Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (or such other person or persons as shall be acceptable to Acquisition Co. and Company) as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent"), to send to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock which shall have been converted into Acquisition Co. Common Stock an appropriate letter of transmittal for purposes of surrendering such holderÂ’s certificates for such shares for exchange pursuant hereto (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have represented any shares of Company Common Stock converted in the Merger (a "Company Certificate") shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Certificate to the Exchange Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Acquisition Co. may reasonably specify) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Certificates in exchange for the property described in this Section 1.9.

  

 (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Acquisition Co. shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the holders of Company Certificates and Company Options: (i) an amount of cash sufficient to pay all amounts of Merger Consideration

   payable under this Agreement, including such cash required in accordance with
Section 1.8(b), (ii) certificates representing a sufficient number of shares
of Acquisition Co. Common Stock (each, an "Acquisition Co. Certificate") to
effect the conversion of Company Common Stock into Acquisition Co. Common
Stock, and (iii) a global security representing all of the Contingent Share
Rights. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash deposited by Acquisition Co.
hereunder as directed by Surviving Corporation, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Acquisition Co.

  

 (c) Upon surrender for cancellation to the Exchange Agent of all Company Certificate(s) held by any holder of record of a Company Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, such holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) an Acquisition Co. Certificate representing the number of whole shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by the surrendered Company Certificate(s) shall have been converted at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.8(a), (ii) cash representing the amount into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by the surrendered Company Certificate(s) shall have been converted at the Effective Time pursuant to 1.8(a), without interest, (iii) cash in lieu of any fractional share of Acquisition Co. Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.8(b), and (iv) a proportionate share of the Additional Merger Consideration, if any. The Company Certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Acquisition Co. or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Acquisition Co. or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in Section 2.14 hereof) law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Acquisition Co. or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Acquisition Co. or the Exchange Agent.

  

 (d) Until surrendered as contemplated by Section 1.9(c), each Company Certificate, other than in respect of the Dissenting Shares, shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive (i) certificates representing the shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Certificate have been converted, (ii) cash representing the amount into which the shares of Company Stock represented by such Company Certificate have been converted, without interest, (iii) any additional cash, without interest, to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.8(b) and (iv) a proportionate share of the Additional Merger Consideration, if any.

  

 (e) If any cash is to be paid to, or Acquisition Co. Certificates are to be issued to, a person other than the person in whose name the Company Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the payment or issuance thereof that the Company Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of cash to a person other

   than, or of the issuance of Acquisition Co. Certificates in any name other
than that of, the registered holder of the Company Certificate surrendered,
or otherwise required, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

 (f) All shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock issued and all cash paid upon the surrender of Company Certificates in accordance with the terms of Section 1.9, and any cash paid pursuant to Section 1.8(b) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Company Certificates, except the right to a proportionate share of the Additional Merger Consideration, which rights shall continue to exist until they expire or are satisfied by the delivery of the Additional Merger Consideration, as provided in Section 1.9 (j) below. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Company shall be closed, and at the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of CompanyÂ’s Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for certificates representing the Acquisition Co. Common Stock and the cash into which they were converted as provided in herein.

  

 (g) Any portion of the cash, Acquisition Co. Common Stock or Additional Merger Consideration delivered to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.9(b) which remains undistributed for eighteen months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Acquisition Co., upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with Section 1.9 and the instructions set forth in the letter of transmittal mailed to such holders after the Effective Time shall thereafter look only to Acquisition Co. (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for payment of the shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock, the cash, or any additional cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock to which they are entitled.

  

 (h) None of Acquisition Co., the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash or Acquisition Co. Common Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

 (i) If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting of a bond to the satisfaction of Acquisition Co. and the Exchange Agent, Exchange Agent will issue for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

  

 (j) On the Closing Date, Acquisition Co. shall issue a global security representing all Contingent Share Rights to be held by the Exchange Agent for the benefit of all holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options. Acquisition Co. shall deliver the security representing the Contingent Share Rights to the Exchange Agent and shall

   also deliver as soon as reasonably practicable a list in such form as the
Exchange Agent shall reasonably require, stating the names and addresses of
all record, and, to the extent ascertainable, beneficial owners of Contingent
Share Rights, and the Exchange Agent shall prepare and transmit to the
beneficial owners, together with such other documents as are appropriate in
the judgment of the Exchange Agent to effect the surrender of certificates
theretofore representing Company Common Stock a notice indicating the
beneficial interest in the Contingent Share Rights held by each beneficial
owner. 

  

 (k) Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall appoint B. Riley and Co., Inc as representative (the "StockholdersÂ’ Representative") to enforce the rights of such holders in respect of the Contingent Share Rights and payment of any Additional Merger Consideration. Each Contingent Share Right will entitle the beneficial owner to receive that number of shares of Additional Merger Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.3(b) of this Agreement.

  

 (l) Within ten (10) days of the end of the Measurement Period, Acquisition Co. will deliver to the Exchange Agent and the StockholdersÂ’ Representative (A) an officerÂ’s certificate of Acquisition Co. certifying (x) the highest closing sale price of Acquisition Co. Common Stock over any twenty (20) consecutive trading day period during the Measurement Period, and (y) Acquisition Co.Â’s calculation of the Additional Merger Consideration payable to each beneficial holder of Contingent Share Rights; (B) a certificate representing a sufficient number of shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock to pay all Additional Merger Consideration payable to beneficial holders of Contingent Share Rights under this Agreement, and (C) such cash as is necessary to satisfy amounts due the holders of Company Options cancelled pursuant to Section 1.4 of this Agreement.

  

 (m) If the StockholdersÂ’ Representative disagrees with Acquisition Co.Â’s calculation of the Additional Merger Consideration payable, it shall send a written notice stating the basis for such disagreement within five (5) days of receiving the notice from Acquisition Co. contemplated by Section 1.3(l) above and Acquisition Co. and the StockholdersÂ’ Representative shall either resolve the disagreement within three (3) days of the notice or submit the calculation of Additional Merger Consideration to an independent certified public accounting firm of nationally recognized standing mutually agreeable to Acquisition Co. and the StockholdersÂ’ Representative, which shall determine the Additional Merger Consideration payable within 30 days. Acquisition Co. shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the independent certified public accounting firm.

  

 (n) At such time that StockholdersÂ’ Representative and Acquisition Co. agree on, or the independent certified public accounting firm determines, the calculation of the Additional Merger Consideration payable, the parties will deliver written notice to the Exchange Agent along with any shares or cash representing the Additional Merger Consideration payable but not previously deposited pursuant to Section 1.9(l), and the Exchange Agent will distribute such shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock as are payable to beneficial holders of Contingent Share Rights in satisfaction of Acquisition Co.Â’s obligation to pay Additional Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.3(b) hereof. 

   (o) If the closing sales price of Acquisition Co.Â’s Common Stock equals or exceeds the Target Price during any twenty (20) consecutive trading day period during the Measurement Period, and Acquisition Co. is therefore not required to issue any Additional Merger Consideration, the Contingent Share Rights will be void.

  

 1.10.  _Dissenting Stockholders._ Shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a right to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holderÂ’s right to appraisal. If after the Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his right to appraisal in respect of his shares of Company Common Stock, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive any Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.8, without interest thereon, upon the surrender of certificates representing such shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.10, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, the right of any holder to receive the fair value of his Dissenting Shares shall cease. The Company shall give the Acquisition Co. prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares, and the Acquisition Co. shall have the right to participate in and to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Acquisition Co., make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. 

  

 2.  _Representations and Warranties as to Company_. The Parent and Company hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to Acquisition Co. and Acquisition Sub as set forth in this Section 2.

  

 2.1.  _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Company and Subsidiary (as defined in Section 2.3 below) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, with full corporate power and corporate authority to (a) own, lease and operate its respective properties, (b) carry on the Business as currently conducted by it and (c) execute and deliver, and perform under this Agreement and each other agreement and instrument to be executed and delivered by it pursuant hereto. Each of Company and Subsidiary is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character and location of the properties owned or leased by it, or the conduct of the Business makes it necessary for Company or Subsidiary to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation, except where the failure to be so qualified, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement a "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any change, effect or circumstance that (a) is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the business, assets, liabilities, operations, condition or prospects (financial or otherwise), results of operations or the conduct of business of Company (or the Surviving Corporation) and its Subsidiary, taken as a whole, other than such changes, effects or circumstances reasonably attributable to (i) economic conditions generally in the United States or foreign economies in any

   locations where Company or its Subsidiary has material operations or sales;
(ii) conditions generally affecting the industries in which Company or
its Subsidiary participates; _provided_ , with respect to clauses (i)
and (ii), the changes, effects or circumstances do not have a
materially disproportionate effect (relative to other industry participants)
on Company or its Subsidiary; (iii) the announcement or pendency of the
Merger; (iv) any action taken with Acquisition Co.Â’s express written consent;
(v) any change in the trading price of CompanyÂ’s Common Stock in and of
itself; or (vi) any failure, in and of itself, by Company or its Subsidiary
to meet internal or other estimates, predictions, projections or forecasts of
revenue, net income or any other measure of financial performance (it being
understood that, with respect to clauses (v) and (vi), the facts or
circumstances giving rise or contributing to such change in trading price or
failure to meet estimates or projections may be deemed to constitute, or be
taken into account in determining whether there has been, a Company Material
Adverse Effect); or (b) prevents or materially delays Company from
consummating the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. True and complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation of
each of Company and its Subsidiary and all amendments thereof, and of the By-
Laws of each of Company and its Subsidiary, as amended to date, have
heretofore been furnished to Acquisition Co. Each of CompanyÂ’s and its
SubsidiaryÂ’s respective minute books which have previously been
made available to Acquisition Co. contain records of the meetings and
other corporate actions of CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiaryÂ’s respective
stockholders and Board of Directors (including committees of its Board of
Directors) that are accurate and complete in all material respects.

 (a)  The authorized capital stock of Company consists of 30,000,000 shares of common  stock, $.001 par value (the "Company Common Stock"), 15,908,775 of  which shares are issued and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, and  3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.001 par value (the "Company Preferred  Stock"), none of which is issued and outstanding.

There are no preemptive rights with regard to the capital stock of Company. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.2(b) and except for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, there are no outstanding contractual obligations or other commitments or arrangements of Company to (A) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of Company (or any interest therein), (B) provide funds to or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any other entity, (C) issue or distribute to any person any capital stock of Company, or (D) issue or distribute to holders of any of the capital stock of Company any evidences of indebtedness or assets of Company. All of the outstanding securities of Company have been issued and sold by Company in full compliance

   with applicable federal and state securities laws. The option granted under

 2.4.  _Authority_. (a) The execution and delivery by Company and Parent of this Agreement and of all of the agreements to be executed and delivered by Company and Parent pursuant hereto (collectively, the "Company Documents"), the performance by Company and Parent of its or his respective obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly and validly authorized by Parent and have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Company, and Company has all necessary corporate power and corporate authority with respect thereto, subject to approval of the Merger by CompanyÂ’s stockholders. This Agreement is, and when executed and delivered by Company and Parent, each of the other agreements to be delivered by either or both of them pursuant hereto will be, the valid and binding obligations of Company and Parent, to the extent they are parties thereto, in accordance with their respective terms, except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to the rules of law governing (and all limitations on) specific performance, injunctive relief, and other equitable remedies.

 2.5.  _Noncontravention_. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.5, neither the execution and delivery by Company or Parent of this Agreement or of any other Company Documents to be executed and delivered by either or both of them, nor the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, nor the performance by either or both of them of any of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder, will (nor with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both would) (a) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of Company, each as amended to date, (b) give rise to a default, or any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration, or otherwise be in conflict with or result in a loss of contractual benefits to either Company, its Subsidiary or Parent, under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which any of them is a party or by which any of them or any of their respective assets may be bound, or, except as set forth on Schedule 2.5, require any consent, approval, notice or payment under the terms of any such document or instrument, (c) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 2.4(b), violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, law, statute, rule or regulation of any court or governmental authority which is applicable to Company, Subsidiary or Parent, (d) result in the creation or imposition of any material lien, adverse claim, restriction, charge or encumbrance upon any of the assets of Company or its Subsidiary or the Company Common Stock, or (e) interfere with or otherwise adversely affect the ability of Acquisition Co. or the Surviving Corporation to carry on the Business after the Closing Date (as defined in Section 6) on substantially the same basis as is now conducted by Company and its Subsidiary.

The Company Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, consistently applied ("U.S. GAAP") and fairly present in all material respects the financial position of Company and its Subsidiary as at the date thereof and the results of the operations and cash flow for the periods indicated and, to the extent audited, are accompanied by the related unqualified opinions of KPMG, LLP, copies of which have been delivered to Acquisition Co. No report of auditors concerning such Company Financial Statements has been withdrawn or modified. The

   books and records of Company and its Subsidiary are complete and correct in
all material respects, have been maintained in accordance with applicable
material legal and accounting requirements, except for such failures as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, and accurately reflect the basis for the financial condition, results
of operations and cash flow of Company and its Subsidiary as set forth in the
Company Financial Statements.

   failure, in and of itself, by Acquisition Co. to meet internal or
other estimates predictions, projections or forecasts of revenue, net income
or any other measure of financial performance (it being understood
that, with respect to clauses (v) and (vi), the facts or circumstances giving
rise or contributing to such change in trading price or failure to meet
estimates or projections may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into
account in determining whether there has been, an Acquisition Co. Material
Adverse Effect); or (b) prevents or materially delays Acquisition Co. from

 3.4. _Authority_.

Intangibles, or Acquisition Co.Â’s or its subsidiaries use thereof in connection with their respective businesses, is subject to any outstanding order, decree, judgment, stipulation or any lien, security interest or other encumbrance.

any other member of an affiliated group of which Acquisition Co. is or was
the common parent) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise. No claim has been made by any taxing authority in a

material Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation in that
jurisdiction. Neither Acquisition Co. nor its Acquisition Sub has been a

   violations of the terms thereof have heretofore occurred within the past
three years or, to Acquisition Co.Â’s Knowledge, exist as of the date of this
Agreement, except for such violations which have not had or would not,

Effect.

 3.16. _Regulatory Compliance; Information Supplied_.

  

 Acquisition Co. has duly and timely filed all reports, statements, forms, schedules, registration statements, prospectuses, proxy statements, and other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, since December 31, 2002 ("Acquisition Co. SEC Reports"). Except as disclosed therein, each of the Acquisition Co. SEC Reports, at the time of its filing, complied in all material respects, and each Acquisition Co.Â’s SEC Reports to be filed after the date hereof, shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder and other federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations applicable to such documents, and did not, at the time filed, and will not, if filed subsequent to the date hereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except as disclosed in the Acquisition Co. SEC Reports, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of violation by the staff of the SEC or any notice that the SEC will or intends to initiate an enforcement proceeding against Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

   Each required form, report and document containing financial statements that Acquisition Co. has filed with or furnished to the SEC since July 31, 2002 was accompanied by the certifications required to be filed or furnished by Acquisition Co.Â’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and at the time of filing or submission of each such certification, such certification (i) was true and accurate and complied with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) did not contain any qualifications or exceptions to the matters certified therein, except as otherwise permitted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (iii) has not been modified or withdrawn. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Acquisition Co. nor any of its officers has received notice from any governmental entity questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness, content, form or manner of filing or furnishing of such certifications. Acquisition Co.Â’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Sections 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act) effectively enable Acquisition Co. to comply with, and the appropriate officers of Acquisition Co. to make all certifications required under, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

  

 The information supplied or to be supplied by the Acquisition Co. for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement shall not, at (i) the time the Registration Statement is declared effective, (ii) the time the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the stockholders of Company and (iii) the time of the Company StockholdersÂ’ Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. All documents that the Acquisition Co. is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger will comply as to form and substance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no representation or warranty is made by Acquisition Co. with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement.

Acquisition Co.Â’s "disclosure controls and procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that material information (both financial and non-financial) relating to Acquisition Co. required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,

   summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
Acquisition Co.Â’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Acquisition Co.
required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to such
reports

  

 3.18.  _Listing and Maintenance Requirements_.

 (c) by Acquisition Co. and Acquisition Sub, if Acquisition Co. and Acquisition Sub are not in material breach of any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements under this Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of Company or the Parent and (i) Company and the Parent are not using their reasonable efforts to cure such breach or have not cured such breach, in either case, within five (5) business days after receipt of notice of such breach by Company and the Parent ( _provided, however,_ that, no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured) and (ii) as a result of such breach any of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 would not then be satisfied;

  

 (d) by Company and/or the Parent, if Company and the Parent are not in material breach of any of their representations, warranties, covenants and agreements under this Agreement and there has been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of Acquisition Co. or Acquisition Sub and (i) Acquisition Co. and Acquisition Sub are not using their reasonable efforts to cure such breach or has not cured such breach, in either case, within five (5) business days, after receipt of notice of such breach by Acquisition Co. and Acquisition Sub ( _provided, however,_ that no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured), and (ii) as a result of such breach any of the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 would not then be satisfied; 

  

 (e) by Acquisition Co., if the Board of Directors of Company shall have (A) failed to make the Company Recommendation, (B) withdrawn the Company Recommendation, (C) modified the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Acquisition Co. or Acquisition Sub, (D) approved or recommended to its stockholders an Acquisition Proposal other than that contemplated by this Agreement or entered into any

continued evaluation of such Acquisition Proposal, (F) recommended that the

is commenced which, if successful, would result in any Person or group
becoming a beneficial owner of 20% or more of the outstanding capital stock
of Company or (G) shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing;

  

 (f) by Company, if the Board of Directors of Company shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such action is necessary in order for it to be deemed to have acted in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties under the DGCL and under any other applicable law in connection with its approval of a Superior Proposal; provided that Acquisition Co. and/or Acquisition Sub does not make, within two (2) business days of receipt of CompanyÂ’s written notification of its intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(f), an offer that the Board of Directors of Company determines, in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation, is at least as favorable, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of Company as such Superior Proposal. Company shall (A) not enter into a binding agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal until at least two (2) business days after it has provided the notice to Acquisition Co. required by this section and (B) notify Acquisition Co. promptly if its intention to enter into a written agreement referred to in its notification shall change at any time after giving such notification, provided that contemporaneously with such termination, Company shall have made the payment of the fee to Acquisition Co. required by it under 7.2(a) by wire transfer in same day funds; and

  

 (g) by Company or Acquisition Co., if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided further, however,_  that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Subsection 7.1(g) shall not be available to Company if the failure to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been caused by the action or failure to act by Company and such action or failure constitutes a material breach by Company of this Agreement.

  

 7.2.  _Effect of Termination_. 

  

 (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in this Section 7, this Agreement shall, forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto, _provided, however,_ that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach hereof. Such a termination shall not, however, affect the obligations of the parties with respect to Sections 4.2 (Brokers), 4.3 (Investigation; Confidentiality) and Section 7.3 (Fees and Expenses). Furthermore, Company shall pay to Acquisition Co., the sum of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the "Termination Fee") in the event that this Agreement is terminated as follows: (i) if Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f); (ii) if Acquisition Co. shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e) or (iii) if (A) Acquisition Co. or Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to 7.1(g). Any Termination Fee payable under this provision shall be 

   payable as liquidated damages to compensate Acquisition Co. for the damages
Acquisition Co. will suffer if this Agreement is terminated under the
circumstances set forth in this Section 7.2(a), which damages cannot be
determined with reasonable certainty. It is specifically agreed that the
Termination Fee represents liquidated damages and not a penalty.

  

 (b) Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) shall be paid prior to or contemporaneously with, and shall be a pre-condition to the effectiveness of, termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f). Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(ii) and (iii) shall be paid not later than two (2) business days after the date of termination. All payments under this Section 7.2(b) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Acquisition Co. Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Acquisition Co. would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.2 and, in order to obtain such payment, Acquisition Co. commences a suit which results in a judgment against Company for the fee set forth in this Section 7.2, Company shall pay to Acquisition Co. its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee at the prime rate in effect on the date such payment is required to be made, as liquidated damages. For the avoidance of doubt, the Termination Fee is intended in part to compensate for all reasonable costs and expenses of Acquisition Co. in connection with this Agreement, if a Termination Fee is payable and as such represents an exception to Section 7.3 but shall not create any other duty or obligation to pay such costs or expenses if no Termination Fee is payable.

  

 7.3.  _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to Section 7.2 and Section 5.2(n), Acquisition Co. and Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, and the Parent (on behalf of itself and on behalf of Company), shall each bear their own expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquisition Co. shall pay all fees in connection with the HSR filing. 

  

 7.4.  _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.

  

 8\. _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that (a) the covenants set forth in Section 4 shall survive the Closing for the period of time specified therein, and (b) none of the representations or warranties in this Agreement shall remain in effect after the Effective Time.

   9.  _General Provisions_.

  

 9.1.  _Notices_. All notices and other communications given or made pursuant hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made as of the earlier of the date delivered or mailed if delivered personally, by overnight courier or mailed by express, registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) or by facsimile transmittal, confirmed by express, certified or registered mail, to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice, except that notices of changes of address shall be effective upon receipt):

    9.2.  _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.

Incorporation under which the Corporation is organized or in any amendment

conferred upon stockholders in said Certificate of Incorporation or any
amendment thereto are granted subject to the aforementioned reservation.

  

 EIGHTH: The Board of Directors shall have the power at any time, and from time to time, to adopt, amend and repeal any and all By-Laws of the Corporation. 

  

 NINTH: 1. Indemnification 

  

 The Corporation shall, and does hereby, indemnify to the fullest extent permitted or authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law or judicial or administrative decisions, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted differently in the future (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), each person (including the current and future heirs, beneficiaries, personal representatives and estate of such person) who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, or was or is a witness, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding") and whether the basis of such Proceeding is an allegation of an action in an official capacity of such person related to the Corporation or any other capacity while such person is serving as an officer, director, employee or agent of the Corporation, against any liability (which for purposes of this Article shall include any judgment, settlement, penalty or fine) or cost, charge or expense (including attorneysÂ’ fees) asserted against him or incurred by him by reason of the fact that such indemnified person (1) is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or (2) is or was an agent of the Corporation as to whom the Corporation, by action of its Board of Directors, has agreed to grant

   such indemnity or (3) is or was serving, at the request of the Corporation,
as a director, officer or employee of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise (including serving as a fiduciary of any
employee benefit plan) or (4) is or was serving as an agent of such other
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise described
in clause (3) hereof as to whom the Corporation, by action of its Board of
Directors, has agreed to grant such indemnity. Each director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation to whom indemnification rights under
this Section 1 of this Article have been granted shall be referred to as an
"Indemnified Person."

  

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as specified in Section 3 of this Article, the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify an Indemnified Person in connection with a Proceeding (or any part thereof) initiated by such Indemnified Person unless such authorization for such Proceeding (or any part thereof) was not denied by the Board of Directors of the Corporation prior to sixty (60) days after receipt of notice thereof from such Indemnified Person stating his intent to initiate such Proceeding and only upon such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may deem appropriate. 

  

 2. Advance of Costs, Charges and Expenses 

  

 Costs, charges and expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees) incurred by an officer, director, employee or agent who is an Indemnified Person in defending a Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted or authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law or judicial or administrative decisions, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted differently in the future (but, in the case of any such future amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the Corporation to provide broader rights to advance costs, charges and expenses than permitted prior thereto), in

   advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay all amounts so
advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined by final
judicial decision that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation as authorized in this Article and upon such other terms and
conditions, in the case of an agent as to whom the Corporation has agreed to
grant such indemnity, as the Board of Directors may deem appropriate. The
Corporation may, upon approval of the Indemnified Person, authorize the
CorporationÂ’s counsel to represent such person in any Proceeding, whether or
not the Corporation is a party to such Proceeding. Such authorization may be
made by the Board of Directors by majority vote, including directors who are
parties to such Proceeding.

  

 3. Procedure for Indemnification 

  

 Any indemnification or advance under this Article shall be made promptly and in any event within sixty (60) days upon the written request of the Indemnified Person (except in the case of a claim for an advancement of costs, charges or expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days). The right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Person in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request under this Article, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within sixty (60) days or twenty (20) days, as may be applicable. Such Indemnified PersonÂ’s costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification or advancement of costs, charges or expenses, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct, if any, required by the Delaware General Corporation Law or judicial or administrative decisions, as the same exists or

   may hereafter be amended or interpreted differently in the future (but, in
the case of any such future amendment or interpretation, only to the extent
that such amendment or interpretation does not impose a more stringent
standard of conduct than permitted prior thereto), but the burden of proving
such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors or any committee thereof, its
independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant
or advancement for the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has
met the applicable standard of conduct, if any, nor the fact that there has
been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors or any committee thereof, its independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 

  

 4. Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Indemnification

  

 The indemnification and advancement provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those Indemnified Persons may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or recommendation of counsel or otherwise, both as to actions in such personÂ’s official capacity and as to actions in any other capacity while holding such office or position, and shall continue as to an Indemnified Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, beneficiaries, personal representatives and the estate of such person. All rights to indemnification and advancement under this Article shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each Indemnified Person who serves or served in such capacity at any time while this Article is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Article or any repeal or

   modification of relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law
or any other applicable laws shall not in any way diminish any rights to
indemnification of such Indemnified Person, or the obligations of the
Corporation arising hereunder, for claims relating to matters occurring prior
to such repeal or modification.

  

 5. Insurance

  

 The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including serving as a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan) against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article or the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

  

 6. Savings Clause 

  

 If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify and advance costs to each Indemnified Person as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any Proceeding, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and as permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

  

 TENTH: No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for any monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duty as a

   director, provided that this provision shall not eliminate or limit the
liability of a director (i) for any breach of the directorÂ’s duty of loyalty
to the Corporation or its stockholders; (ii) for acts or omissions not in
good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of
law; (iii) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware; or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit. No repeal or amendment of this Article shall
adversely affect any rights of any person pursuant to this Article which
existed at the time of such repeal or amendment with respect to acts or
omissions occurring prior to such repeal or amendment.

AFFILIATE AGREEMENT

  

 AFFILIATE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") dated as of ______, 2006, by and between Iconix Brand Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Acquisition Co."), and the undersigned shareholder who may be deemed an affiliate ("Affiliate") of Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).

  

RECITALS

  

 WHEREAS, Acquisition Co., Moss Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquisition Co. ("Acquisition Sub"), the Company and Mossimo Giannulli, the majority shareholder of Company, are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of _________, 2006 (the "Merger Agreement"), which provides, among other things, for the merger (the "Merger") of the Company with and into Acquisition Sub, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. As a result of the Merger, Affiliate will receive cash and shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Acquisition Co. (the "Acquisition Co. Common Stock") in exchange for securities issued by the Company owned by Affiliate.

  

 WHEREAS, Affiliate has been advised that Affiliate may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of the Company, as the term "affiliate" is used for purposes of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and of Opinion 16 of the Accounting Principles Board.

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

 1.  _Acknowledgments by Affiliate_. Affiliate agrees, acknowledges and understands that the representations, warranties and covenants by Affiliate set forth herein shall be relied upon by Acquisition Co., the Company and their respective affiliates, counsel and accounting firms, and that substantial losses and damages may be incurred by these persons if AffiliateÂ’s representations, warranties or covenants are breached. Affiliate has carefully read this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and has discussed the requirements of this Agreement with AffiliateÂ’s professional advisors, who are qualified to advise Affiliate with regard to such matters.

  

 2.  _Compliance with Rule 145 and the Securities Act_.

  

 (a)  Affiliate has been advised that (i) the issuance of shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock in connection with the Merger is expected to be effected pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the resale of such shares shall be subject to restrictions set forth in Rule 145 under the Securities Act, and (ii) Affiliate may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company. Affiliate accordingly agrees not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Acquisition Co. Common Stock issued to Affiliate in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the requirements of Rule 145(d) promulgated under the Securities Act, or (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or
an appropriate exemption from registration, or (iii) Affiliate delivers to
Acquisition Co. a written opinion of counsel, reasonably acceptable to
Acquisition Co. in form and substance, that such sale, transfer or other
disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities Act.

  

 (b) Execution of this Agreement shall not be considered an admission on AffiliateÂ’s part that he or she is an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the recitals to this Agreement, or as a waiver of any rights that Affiliate may have to object to any claim that Affiliate is such an affiliate of the Company on or after the date of this Agreement.

  

 (c) Acquisition Co. shall give stop transfer instructions to its transfer agent with respect to any Acquisition Co. Common Stock received by Affiliate pursuant to the Merger and there shall be placed on the certificates representing such Common Stock, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

     



   
--- 
   

"THE SHARES  REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH RULE  145 APPLIES AND MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN CONFORMITY WITH RULE
145(d) OR  PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF  1933, AS AMENDED, OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH A WRITTEN OPINION
OF COUNSEL,  REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE ISSUER IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE, THAT
SUCH TRANSFER  IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED."

   
   

The legend set forth above shall be removed (by delivery of a substitute
certificate without such legend) and Acquisition Co. shall so instruct its
transfer agent, if Affiliate delivers to Acquisition Co. (i) satisfactory
written evidence that the shares have been sold in compliance with Rule 145
(in which case, the substitute certificate shall be issued in the name of the
transferee), or (ii) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Acquisition Co., to the effect that public sale of the shares
by the holder thereof is no longer subject to Rule 145.

  

 (d) Acquisition Co. hereby agrees that for so long as and to the extent necessary to permit Affiliate to sell Acquisition Co. Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145 and, to the extent applicable, Rule 144 under the Securities Act, Acquisition Co. shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to file on a timely basis, all reports and data required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by it pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

  

 3.  _Termination_. This Agreement shall be terminated and shall be of no further force and effect in the event of the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7 of the Merger Agreement.

   4.  _Miscellaneous_.

  

 (a)  _Waiver; Severability_. No waiver by any party hereto of any condition or of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by each party hereto. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application of any such provision to any person, entity or set of circumstances, shall be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to persons, entities or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or otherwise affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

  

 (b)  _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto may be assigned by either of the parties without prior written consent of the other party hereto.

  

 (c)  _Amendments and Modification_. This Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by the parties hereto.

  

 (d)  _Injunctive Relief_. Each of the parties acknowledge that (i) the covenants and the restrictions contained in this Agreement are necessary, fundamental and required for the protection of Acquisition Co. and the Company and to preserve for Acquisition Co. the benefits of the Merger; (ii) such covenants relate to matters which are of a special, unique, and extraordinary character that gives each of such covenants a special, unique, and extraordinary value; and (iii) a breach of any such covenants or any other provision of this Agreement shall result in irreparable harm and damages to Acquisition Co. and the Company which cannot be adequately compensated by a monetary award. Accordingly, it is expressly agreed that in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity, Acquisition Co. and the Company shall be entitled to the immediate remedy of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or such other form of injunctive or equitable relief as may be used by any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain or enjoin any of the parties hereto from breaching any such covenant or provision or to specifically enforce the provisions hereof.

  

 (e)  _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of laws rules or provisions (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

  

 (f)  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Merger Agreement and any other agreements referred to in the Merger Agreement set forth the entire understanding of Affiliate and Acquisition Co. relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between Affiliate and Acquisition Co. relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

   (g)  _Further Assurances_. Affiliate shall execute and/or cause to be delivered to Acquisition Co. such instruments and other documents and shall take such other actions as Acquisition Co. may reasonably request to effectuate the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

  

 (h)  _Third Party Reliance_. Counsel to and independent auditors for Acquisition Co. and the Company shall be entitled to rely upon this Affiliate Agreement.

  

 (i)  _Survival_. The representations, warranties, covenants and other provisions contained in this Agreement shall survive the Merger.

  

 (j)  _Notices_. All notices and other communications pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and deemed to be sufficient if contained in a written instrument and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, telecopied, sent by nationally-recognized overnight courier or mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), postage prepaid, to the parties at the following address (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):

 LOCK-UP AGREEMENT (this "AGREEMENT"), dated as of ____________, 2006, by and among Iconix Brand Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Acquisition Co."), Mossimo Giannulli and Edwin Lewis, each a stockholder (each individually, a "Stockholder" and together, the "Stockholders") of Mossimo, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

  

RECITALS

  

 WHEREAS, Acquisition Co., Moss Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquisition Co. ("Acquisition Sub"), and the Company have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 31, 2006 (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company will be merged with and into the Acquisition Sub, and the Acquisition Sub shall be the surviving corporation following the merger (the "Merger").

  

 WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Stockholder is a Beneficial Owner (as defined below) of Subject Shares (as defined below).

  

 WHEREAS, in order to induce Acquisition Co. to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Stockholders have agreed to enter into this Agreement.

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

 1.  _Definitions_.

  

 (a) "Beneficially Own" or "Beneficial Owner" with respect to any securities means having "beneficial ownership" as determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

  

 (b) "Company Capital Stock" means shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company.

  

 (c) "Company Options and Other Rights" means options, warrants and other rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, shares of Company Capital Stock.

  

 (d) "Expiration Date" means the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or (ii) the date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms.

  

 (e) "Subject Shares" means (i) all shares of Company Capital Stock Beneficially Owned by each Stockholder as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) all additional shares of Company Capital Stock of which each Stockholder acquires Beneficial Ownership during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Expiration Date.

  

 (f) Unless otherwise specifically defined herein, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement. 2.  _Lock-up Agreement_.

  

 (a) In consideration of the issuance of common stock of Acquisition Co. in exchange for the Subject Shares (the "Acquisition Co. Shares") to each of the Stockholders pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and notwithstanding any registration of the Acquisition Co. Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), each Stockholder agrees that, during the period beginning from the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and continuing for ninety (90) days thereafter (as the same may be extended pursuant to this Section 2(a), the "Release Date") (the "Lock-up Period"), each Stockholder will not, directly or indirectly, through an "affiliate" or "associate" (as such terms are defined in the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act), a family member or otherwise, (a) offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, assign, tender, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale or other disposition or transfer or grant any rights with respect to any Acquisition Co. Shares, privately or publicly, pursuant to Rule 144 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act or otherwise, or (b) engage directly or indirectly in any transaction the likely result of which would involve a transaction prohibited by clause (a), except as permitted by Section 2(e) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2(a), at the request of underwriters or the managing underwriter in connection with a proposed transaction or public offering by the Company, each Stockholder will agree to extend the Lock-up Period for a term consistent with the period for which the Chief Executive Officer of Acquisition Co. enters into an agreement imposing on his shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock similar restrictions on transfer.

  

 (b) The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to preclude each of the Stockholders from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is designed to, or reasonably expected to lead to, or result in, a sale or disposition of the Acquisition Co. Shares even if such shares would be disposed of by someone other than the Stockholders. Such prohibited hedging or other transactions would include without limitation any short sale or any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including without limitation any put or call option) with respect to any of the Acquisition Co. Shares or with respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its value from the Acquisition Co. Shares.

  

 (c) Each Stockholder further represents and agrees that he has not taken and will not take, directly or indirectly, any action which is designed to or which has constituted or which might reasonably be expected to cause or result in stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of Acquisition Co. to facilitate the sale or resale of the Acquisition Co. Shares, or which has otherwise constituted or will constitute any prohibited bid for or purchase of the Acquisition Co. Shares or any related securities.

  

 (d) Each Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the Release Date, any additional Acquisition Co. Shares acquired by such Stockholder, including in connection with the exercise of any options, may not be sold or otherwise transferred, notwithstanding that a registration statement may be effective with respect thereto.

   (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions on transfer, each Stockholder may transfer all or any part of his Acquisition Co. Shares (i) to the other Stockholder (provided, however, that no transfer may be in respect of any Contingent Share Rights); (ii) by will or intestacy, (iii) to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of such Stockholder or the immediate family of such Stockholder, provided that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for value, or (iii) in a private transaction prior to the Release Date so long as the acquirer of Acquisition Co.

 (c) The execution, delivery and performance by each Stockholder of this Agreement will not conflict with, require a consent, waiver or approval under, or result in a breach of or default under, any of the terms of any contract, commitment or other obligation (written or oral) to which such Stockholder is a party or by which any of such StockholderÂ’s assets may be bound.

In the event (a) of any stock dividend, stock split, merger, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or the like of the capital stock of the Company on, of or affecting the Subject Shares or (b) that a Stockholder shall become the Beneficial Owner of any additional shares of Company Capital Stock, then the terms of this Agreement shall apply to the shares of Company Capital Stock or other instruments or documents held by such Stockholder immediately following the effectiveness of the events described in clause (a) or such Stockholder becoming the Beneficial Owner thereof as described in clause (b), as though, in either case, they were Subject Shares hereunder.

 8.  _Amendments and Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by law, (a) no waiver that may be given by a party shall be applicable except in the specific instance for which it was given and (b) no notice to or demand on one party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand.

  

 9.  _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the foregoing, all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective executors, heirs, personal representatives, successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no rights may under any circumstances be transferred in respect of any Contingent Share Rights.

    |

    |  



    
     



    |  

 Giannulli  agrees not to file any patent, copyright, or trademark applications relating  to any Invention, except with prior written consent of an authorized  representative of the Company (other than Giannulli).

    
     



    |  



    
     



    |  

 Giannulli  hereby expressly disclaims any and all interest in any Inventions and waives  any right of DROIT MORALE or similar rights, such as rights of integrity or  the right to be attributed as the creator of the Invention.

    
     



    |  



    
     



    |  

 5.  FURTHER ASSURANCES. Giannulli agrees to assist the Company, or any party  designated by the Company, promptly on the CompanyÂ’s request, whether before  or after the termination of employment, however such termination may occur,  in perfecting, registering, maintaining, and enforcing, in all jurisdictions,  the CompanyÂ’s rights in the Inventions by performing all acts and executing  all documents and instruments deemed necessary or convenient by the Company,  including, by way of illustration and not limitation:

    |  



    
     



    |  

 Giannulli  will be reimbursed for all out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred in  connection with the foregoing. In addition, to the extent that, for whatever  reason, GiannulliÂ’s technical expertise shall be required in connection with  the fulfillment of the aforementioned obligations, the Company will  compensate Giannulli at a reasonable rate for the time actually spent by  Giannulli at the CompanyÂ’s request rendering such assistance.

with the Company. Giannulli agrees that, during the  term of this Agreement

[SIGNATURE PAGE TO SERVICES AGREEMENT]

   EXHIBIT I

  

REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

  

 Registration Rights Agreement (this "Agreement"), dated as of ____________, 2006, by and among Iconix Brand Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), Edwin Lewis and Mossimo Giannulli (each, a "Holder").

  

RECITALS

  

 WHEREAS, the Company is concurrently herewith entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), with Moss Acquisition Corp., Mossimo Giannulli, and Mossimo, Inc.; 

  

 WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company will prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-4 in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), of shares (the "Shares") of the CompanyÂ’s common stock, par value $.001 per share, to be issued to the stockholders of Mossimo, Inc., including each Holder (to the extent such Holder at the Effective Time of the Merger owns shares of Mossimo, Inc. common stock), in connection with the merger of Mossimo, Inc. with and into Moss Acquisition Corp. (the "Merger Registration Statement"); and

  

 WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed to grant to each Holder the registration rights set forth herein with respect to the Shares, any securities issued in exchange for or in replacement of the Shares, and any securities issued by way of any stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, or other similar transaction affecting the Shares or any such other securities, and any shares of the CompanyÂ’s common stock issued to Holder as Additional Merger Consideration (collectively, the "Registrable Securities"). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to such terms in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

 1.  _Merger Registration Statement_. The Company acknowledges, and agrees to comply with, its obligations in the Merger Agreement in respect of the Merger Registration Statement.

  

 2.  _Piggyback Registration_.

  

 (a) If, at any time after the date hereof, the Company proposes to prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form thereto) covering only the resale of equity securities of the Company held by its stockholders, the Company will give written notice of its intention to do so to the Holders at least ten (10) days prior to the filing of each such registration statement. Upon the written request of the Holders, made within five (5) days after receipt of the notice, that the Company include any of the Registrable Securities in the proposed registration statement, the Company
shall, as to the Holders, use reasonable best efforts to effect the
registration under the Act of such Registrable Securities which it has been
so requested to register (the "Piggyback Registration");

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the right to Piggyback Registration shall not apply, unless the Company otherwise agrees in writing, to any registration statement: (i) relating to an underwritten public offering of securities of the Company; (ii) relating solely to securities of the Company to be offered pursuant to (x) an employee benefit plan, or (y) a dividend or interest reinvestment plan (including such a plan that has an open enrollment or cash investment feature); (iii) relating to securities of the Company to be issued for a consideration other than solely cash; (iv) relating to securities of the Company to be offered solely to existing security holders of the Company, through a "rights offering" or otherwise; (v) relating solely to securities of the Company to be issued on the exercise of options, warrants and similar rights, or on the conversion or exchange of other securities, issued by the Company or any other person; (vi) relating to debt securities of the Company, including debt securities that are convertible or exchangeable for equity securities of the Company; or (vii) that may become effective automatically upon filing with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462 under the Act or otherwise.

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section, the Company shall have the right to elect not to file or to defer the filing of any proposed registration statement or to withdraw the same after the filing but prior to the effective date thereof.

  

 3.  _Demand Registration_.

  

 (a) At any time commencing on the first date the prospectus forming a part of the Merger Registration Statement is no longer current and available for use by a Holder for resales of Registrable Securities because the financial statements included in the prospectus forming a part thereof no longer satisfy the requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act, the Holders may collectively, on one occasion only, submit to the Company a joint written notice (the "Demand Registration Request"), to have the Company use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the Commission, at the sole expense of the Company (except as hereinafter provided), in respect of up to the aggregate number of Registrable Securities not at such time covered in an effective registration statement filed by the Company pursuant to Section 2, a registration statement so as to permit a public offering and sale of such Registrable Securities until, subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the earlier of the date on which: (i) all Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement, or other registration statements filed by the Company, have been sold pursuant thereto or otherwise lawfully sold without registration under the Securities Act; or (ii) all of the remaining Registrable Securities may be publicly sold without volume restrictions pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act, as determined by written opinion of counsel to the Company on which Holders are expressly entitled to rely (the "Effectiveness Period"). The registration statement filed following a Demand Registration Request shall be on any form the Company is eligible to use to register for resale the Registrable Securities. The Company shall, upon receipt of a Demand Registration Request, use its reasonable best effort to cause to be registered under the Securities Act as soon as practicable thereafter all of the Registrable Securities that Holders have so requested to be registered.

   (b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at the time a Demand Registration Request is given to the Company under Section 3 hereof (i) the Company is engaged in negotiations with respect to an acquisition, merger, financing or other material event which would require the Company to file a Form 8-K in the event that such acquisition, merger, financing or other material event is consummated or has otherwise occurred, or (ii) the Company is otherwise unable to obtain information required to be included in the registration statement to be filed or (iii) in the event the Company shall furnish to the Holders a certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company stating that in the good faith judgment of the Company and its investment banker that it would be detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for the Company to immediately proceed with a registration statement and it is therefore essential to defer the filing of such registration statement or any amendment thereto, then, in each such case, the Company will have the right to defer such filing for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the Demand Registration Request; provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any registration statement filed pursuant to this Section 3 to become effective as soon as practicable after such deferral period, and provided further that the Company may not delay any registration requested pursuant to this Section 3 more than once during any twelve-month period. Moreover, if the Company is proceeding with the registration process but the registration statement is subject to review by the Commission and/or audited financial statements for a fiscal year are required to be included but not yet available, the Company may elect to defer filing for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days.

  

 (c) Nothing herein contained shall require the Company to undergo an audit, other than in the ordinary course of business.

  

 4.  _Covenants of the Company._ The Company hereby covenants and agrees as follows:

  

 (a) In accordance with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement as expeditiously as reasonably possible.

  

 (b) Not less than two business days prior to the filing of a registration statement or any related prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish to the Holders copies of all such documents proposed to be filed which documents will be subject to the review of the Holders and the counsel to the Holders.

  

 (c) Use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the Commission such amendments, including post-effective amendments, to the registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep the registration statement continuously effective as to the applicable Registrable Securities for the Effectiveness Period in the case of a Demand Registration.

  

 (d) Notify the Holders as promptly as practicable: (A)(1) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to a registration statement is proposed to be filed hereunder; (2) when the Commission notifies the Company whether there

     will be a "review" of such registration statement and whenever the Commission
comments in writing on such registration statement; and (3) with respect to
the registration statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same
has become effective; (B) of any request by the Commission or any other
Federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to the
registration statement or prospectus or for additional information; (C) of
the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness
of the registration statement covering any or all of the Registrable
Securities or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; (D) of the
receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of
the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable
Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of
any proceeding for such purpose; and (E) of the occurrence of any event or
passage of time that makes the financial statements included in the
registration statement ineligible for inclusion therein or any statement made
in the registration statement or prospectus or any document incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect
or that requires any revisions to the registration statement, prospectus or
other documents so that, in the case of the registration statement or the
prospectus, as the case may be, it will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

 (e) Prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with the selling holders in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from such registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of all jurisdictions within the United States reasonably requested by Holders, to keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) under this Agreement hereof effective during the Effectiveness Period and to do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by the registration statement; provided, that the Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, subject the Company to any material tax in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject or file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction.

  

 (f) Cooperate with the Holders to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be delivered to a transferee pursuant to the registration statement, and to enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as any such persons may request.

  

 (g) With a view to making available to the Holders of Registrable Securities the benefits of Rule 144 (or its successor rule) under the Securities Act and any other rule or regulation of the Commission that may at any time permit such Holders to sell Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the Company covenants and agrees to: (i) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act until the earlier of: (A) such date as all of the Registrable Securities may be resold to the public without volume restrictions pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (B) such date as all of the Registrable Securities shall have been resold; (ii) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents

     required to be so filed pursuant to Rule 144(c) under the Securities Act in
order to permit the Holders of the Registrable Securities to be entitled to
transfer the Registrable Securities without registration pursuant to Rule 144
under the Securities Act; and (iii) furnish to each Holder of Registrable
Securities upon request: (A) a written statement by the Company that it has
complied with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and (B) such
other information as may be reasonably requested in order to avail such
Holder of any rule or regulation of the Commission that permits the selling
of any such Registrable Securities without registration.

  

 (h) The Company will pay all costs, fees and expenses in connection with any registration statement filed pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, the CompanyÂ’s legal and accounting fees, printing expenses and blue sky fees and expenses; provided, however, that the Holders shall be solely responsible for the fees of any counsel and other experts retained by the Holders in connection with such registration and any transfer taxes or underwriting discounts, selling commissions or selling fees applicable to the Registrable Securities sold by the Holders pursuant thereto.

  

 (i) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to list the Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement with each securities exchange or interdealer quotation system or other market on which similar securities of the Company are then listed.

  

 (j) The Company will furnish to each Holder and to his legal counsel, (a) promptly after a registration statement is filed hereunder with the Commission, one copy of the registration statement and any amendments thereto, each preliminary prospectus and final prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto; and (b) a number of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, and all amendments and supplements thereto, and such other documents as each Holder may reasonably request to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holder. The Company will promptly notify each Holder and his designated counsel by facsimile or email of the effectiveness of the applicable registration statement and any post-effective amendment.

  

 (k) The Company will permit HoldersÂ’ legal counsel to review the registration statement and all amendments and supplements thereto a reasonable amount of time prior to their filing with the Commission, and will not file any document in a form to which such counsel reasonably objects, unless otherwise required by law in the opinion of the CompanyÂ’s counsel. The sections of any such registration statement, including information with respect to each Holder, such HolderÂ’s beneficial ownership of securities of the Company or such HolderÂ’s intended method of disposition of Registrable Securities, must conform to the information provided to the Company by each Holder or his counsel, except for such changes resulting from Commission comments. 

  

 (l) At the joint request of the Holders, the Company will promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to the registration statement, and the prospectus used in connection with the registration statement, as may be necessary in order to change the plan of distribution in a manner reasonably requested by the Holders jointly set forth in such registration statement; provided however, such change shall not provide for the disposition of the Registrable Securities on the basis of an underwritten offering and may be modified as required by the Commission or

     as deemed necessary or appropriate by the Company to respond to Commission
comments or to comply with applicable law.

  

 5.  _Acknowledgements and Covenants of the Holders_. 

  

 (a) The Holders, upon receipt of notice from the Company that an event has occurred which requires a post-effective amendment to a registration statement or a supplement to the prospectus included therein, shall promptly discontinue the sale of Registrable Securities until the Holders receive a copy of a supplemented or amended prospectus from the Company, which the Company shall provide as soon as practicable after such notice. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to file and have declared effective any such post-effective amendment as soon as possible.

  

 (b) The obligations of the Company under this Agreement with respect to the Registrable Securities are expressly conditioned on the HoldersÂ’ furnishing to the Company such appropriate information concerning the Holders, the Registrable Securities and the terms of the HoldersÂ’ offering of such Registrable Securities as the Company may reasonably request.

  

 (c) Each Holder agrees, if so requested by the CompanyÂ’s underwriter or managing underwriter in connection with a proposed transaction or offering of securities of the Company, not to sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, effect any public sale or distribution of or otherwise dispose of, any equity securities of the Company during such period of time and on such other terms and conditions as may be requested by such underwriter, provided that the Chief Executive Officer of the Company has also agreed not to sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, effect any public sale or distribution of, or otherwise dispose of, any equity securities of the Company under the circumstances and pursuant to the terms and conditions applicable to the Holders.

  

 6.  _Termination of Registration Rights_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the CompanyÂ’s obligation to register the Registrable Securities under this Agreement shall terminate as to any particular Registrable Securities (a) when all of the Registrable Securities have been sold by each Holder in an offering registered under the Securities Act or otherwise, or (b) when a written opinion (i) upon which each Holder is expressly entitled to rely, and (ii) which states that such Registrable Securities may be sold without registration under the Securities Act or applicable state law and without restriction as to the quantity and manner of such sales, shall have been received from counsel for the Company.

  

 7.  _Indemnification_.

  

 (a) The Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Holder, each of its directors, officers, employees, advisors, attorneys, underwriters, accountants and any person who controls such Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal fees or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action) caused by or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a registration statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto included therein or caused by or arising out of any

   omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the
circumstances in which they are made not misleading, except insofar as such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission based
upon information furnished or required to be furnished in writing to the
Company by such Holder expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be liable to indemnify a Holder insofar as such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or actions are (i) caused by any such untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon
information relating to the Holder furnished to the Company in writing by
Holder expressly for use therein, (ii) based upon HolderÂ’s failure to provide
the Company with a material fact relating to Holder which is required to be
included in the registration statement or necessary to make a statement in
the registration statement not be misleading, (iii) relate to sales of
Registrable Securities by Holder to the person asserting any such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or actions if such person was not sent or given
a prospectus by or on behalf of the Holder, if required by law so to have
been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the
Registrable Securities to such person, and if the prospectus (as so amended
or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities, unless such failure is the result of
noncompliance by the Company or based upon the HolderÂ’s use of a prospectus
during a period when the Holder has been notified that the use of the
prospectus has been suspended. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and
effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Holder,
and any directors, officers, participating person, or controlling person
thereof, and shall survive the transfer of such Registrable Securities by
Holder. Each Holder shall at the same time indemnify the Company, its
directors, each officer signing a registration statement and each person who
controls the Company within the meaning of the Act from and against any and
all losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by or arising out of any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
a registration statement or prospectus included therein, or caused by or
arising out of any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, in each case, only insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omissions or alleged omission based upon information furnished
in writing to the Company by the Holder expressly for use therein.

  

 (b) If for any reason the foregoing indemnity is unavailable, or is insufficient to hold harmless any indemnitee, then the indemnitor shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnitee as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnitor on the one hand and the indemnitee on the other from the registration, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, or provides a lesser sum to the indemnitee than the amount hereinafter calculated, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the indemnitor on the one hand and the indemnitee on the other but also the relative fault of the indemnitor and the indemnitee as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and each Holder shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Holders and the partiesÂ’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or

     omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(b), in no event
shall the Company be required to contribute any amount of any damages that a
Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

  

 (c) If any proceeding shall be brought or any claim asserted against any person entitled to indemnity under Sections 7 hereof (an "Indemnified Party"), such Indemnified Party promptly shall notify the person from whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing, and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Agreement, except (and only) to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

  

 (d) An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties unless: (i) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses; (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such proceeding; or (iii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable ethical legal standards due to actual or potential interests between them, (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, such counsel shall be at the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel). The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

  

 (e) Subject to the foregoing, all reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (including fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this Section) shall be paid to the Indemnified Party, as incurred, within ten (10) business days of written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party, which notice shall be delivered no more frequently than on a monthly basis (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder; provided, that the Indemnifying Party may require such Indemnified Party to undertake to reimburse all such fees and expenses 

   to the extent it is finally judicially determined that such Indemnified Party
is not entitled to indemnification hereunder).

  

 8.  _Governing Law_.

  

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of laws rules or provisions (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

  

 (b) Each of the Company and each Holder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and of the United States of America located in the County of New York, State of New York (the "New York Courts") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the New York Courts and agrees not to plead or claim that such litigation brought in any New York Courts has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
