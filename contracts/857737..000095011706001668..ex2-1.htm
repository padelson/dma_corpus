The aggregate consideration to be paid by Acquisition Co. in the Merger (the &#147;Merger
Consideration&#148;) shall be the sum of (i) the Initial Merger Consideration (as
defined below) and (ii) the Additional Merger Consideration (as defined below),
if any. The &#147;Initial Merger Consideration&#148; shall be the product of (A) $7.50
multiplied by (B) the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shall be paid as follows: (x)
the issuance of 0.2271139 shares of Acquisition Co. common stock, $.001 par
value (the &#147;Acquisition Co. Common Stock&#148;), for each share of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, based on $3.25 per
share of Company Common Stock divided by $14.31, which is the average closing
sales price of Acquisition Co. Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ National
Market for the three (3) business days ending on the date hereof (the &#147;Acquisition
Co. Initial Sale Price&#148;) (the &#147;Common Stock Consideration&#148;); and (ii) cash in
the amount of $4.25 per share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time minus the Adjustment Amount (as defined below). The
&#147;Adjustment Amount&#148; is an amount equal to the Cash Consideration (as defined
below) divided by the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The &#147;Cash Consideration&#148; is an amount
equal to $4.25 multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, minus an amount equal to
the amount, if any, by which the Adjusted Cash Balance (as defined below) of
Company at the Closing (as defined in Section 6 hereof), less the Option
Payments, if any, to be made pursuant to Section 1.4 below, is less than
$17,000,000. &#147;Adjusted Cash Balance&#148; means (A) the sum, as of the Closing, of
Company&#146;s cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, royalties receivable,
prepaid expenses and inventory, less (B) Company&#146;s accounts payable, the
payment due to Target Corporation under paragraph 5.3 of the TBI License (as
defined in Section 2.5 below) and other accrued payables, all measured in
accordance with U.S. GAAP (as defined in Section 2.6 below). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Common Stock Consideration is subject to reduction as set
forth in Section 1.3(d) below. To the extent that Company Options are exercised
during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the &#147;Interim Period Option Exercises&#148;), increasing the
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding, then the proceeds of all
Interim Period Option Exercises (the &#147;Option Proceeds&#148;) shall be held by the
Company in a separate account of the Company until immediately after the
Closing, and the amount of Option Proceeds shall not be included for purposes
of determining the Adjusted Cash Balance.</FONT></P>

  In the event that the closing sales price of Acquisition Co. Common Stock does
  not equal or exceed the Target Price (as defined below) during each day of any
  twenty (20) consecutive trading day period during the twelve (12) month period
  following the Closing (such twelve (12) month period being hereinafter referred
  to as the &#147;Measurement Period&#148;), Acquisition Co. will issue, within
  twenty (20) business days after the end of the Measurement Period, or if later,
  twenty (20) business days following the resolution pursuant to Section 1.9(m)
  of any disagreement in respect of the number of shares to be issued to the Exchange
  Agent (as defined below) for the benefit of each holder of Company Common Stock
  entitled to Merger Consideration hereunder an additional number of shares of
  Acquisition Co. Common Stock equal to a number obtained by dividing (i) the
  product of (A) the number of shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock issued to
  such holder of Company Common Stock on the Closing multiplied by (B) the difference
  between (x) the Target Price and (y) the greater of (I) the average of the highest
  closing sale price of Acquisition Co. Common Stock over any twenty (20) consecutive
  trading day period during the Measurement Period and (II) the average closing
  sales price of Acquisition Co. Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ National
  Market for the three (3) business days prior to Closing (the &#147;Acquisition
  Co. Average Closing Price&#148;) (the higher stock price in this clause (y)
  is referred to as the &#147;Actual Price&#148;), by (ii) the Actual Price (the
  &#147;Additional Merger Consideration&#148;). The &#147;Target Price&#148; shall
  be defined to mean $18.71, which is 130.76923% of the Acquisition Co. Initial
  Sale Price. In the event that the closing sales price of Acquisition Co.&#146;s
  Common Stock equals or exceeds the Target Price during the Measurement Period,
  Acquisition Co. shall not be required to issue any Additional Merger Consideration.
  The right of each holder of Company Common Stock and Company Options to receive
  Additional Merger Consideration will be evidenced by a non-transferable contingent
  share right (each, a &#147;Contingent Share Right&#148; and collectively, the
  &#147;Contingent Share Rights&#148;) to be issued to the Exchange Agent for
  the benefit of the holders of Common Stock and Company Options in accordance
  with Section 1.9 of this Agreement. Acquisition Co. shall also pay to each holder
  of a Company Option that was cancelled pursuant to Section 1.4 below the cash
  value of the Additional Merger Consideration such holder would have received
  if such holder had exercised his or her Company Options prior to the Effective
  Time, less any applicable tax withholding.</FONT></P>

During the Measurement Period, if there is an acquisition or consolidation of
Acquisition Co. in which the stockholders of Acquisition Co. are not at least a
majority of the stockholders of the surviving entity, or a sale, conveyance or
transfer of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of Acquisition
Co., and (i) the per share purchase price of Acquisition Co. or (ii) the
aggregate consideration paid for the assets of Acquisition Co. divided by the
number of shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock outstanding on the closing
date of such asset sale ((i) or (ii), as applicable, the &#147;Measurement Price&#148;)
is less than the Target Price, the Additional Merger Consideration shall become
payable within twenty (20) business days following the closing of such
acquisition, transfer, consolidation or sale, and the Measurement Price shall
be deemed the Actual Price for purposes of calculating the Additional Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Common Stock.</FONT></P>

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.3, if the
Acquisition Co. Average Closing Price equals or exceeds the Maximum Share Price</FONT></P>

below), which is the Maximum Stock Consideration Percentage (as defined below)
of the Acquisition Co. Initial Sale Price, then in such case the number of
shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock issuable as Common Stock Consideration
as part of the Initial Merger Consideration shall be determined by dividing the
Maximum Stock Consideration (as defined below) by the Acquisition Co. Average
Closing Price, in lieu of the formula set forth in Section 1.3(a)(ii)(B)(x).
Furthermore, Acquisition Co. may, at its sole option, elect to pay any portion
of the Initial Merger Consideration which is in excess of $135,147,866 in
either cash or stock, provided that in no event shall the cash portion of the
total Merger Consideration payable exceed 60% of the total Merger Consideration
paid under this Agreement, and in the event that Acquisition Co. exercises its
option to pay any such excess in cash or stock, an appropriate corresponding
adjustment shall accordingly be made to the per share amounts of stock and
cash, as the case may be, payable by Acquisition Co. as Merger Consideration
hereunder. For purposes hereof, (I) the &#147;Maximum Share Price&#148; shall be equal to
the Acquisition Co. Initial Sale Price multiplied by the Maximum Stock
Consideration Percentage; (II) the &#147;Maximum Stock Consideration Percentage&#148;
shall be equal to the amount of the Maximum Stock Consideration divided by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding at the Closing, with the
result thereof divided by $3.25; and (III) the &#147;Maximum Stock Consideration&#148;
shall be $150,000,000 reduced by the amount of Cash Consideration, and further
reduced, if applicable, by the amount by which the Adjusted Cash Balance at the
Closing, less the Option Payments, if any, to be made pursuant to Section 1.4
below, is less than $17,000,000.</FONT></P>

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.3, in no event shall
the number of shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock that Acquisition Co. is
required to issue as Common Stock Consideration and/or Additional Merger
Consideration under this Agreement exceed 19.99% of the total issued and
outstanding shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock at the date of Closing or at
the end of the Measurement Period. Any shares required to be issued hereunder
as Initial Merger Consideration and/or Additional Merger Consideration in
excess of 19.99% of the total issued and outstanding shares of Acquisition Co.
Common Stock on the applicable date, shall be paid in cash and shall be valued
at the Acquisition Co. Average Closing Price with respect to shares issued as
the Initial Merger Consideration and at the Actual Price with respect to shares
issued as the Additional Merger Consideration. In addition, any shares issued
as Additional Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect
any stock dividend, stock split, subdivision, combination, reclassification or
similar transaction in respect of the Acquisition Co. Common Stock.</FONT></P>

cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any cancelled
Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in
cash (subject to any applicable withholding or other taxes required by
applicable law to be withheld) of an amount equal to the product of (A) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock previously subject to such
Company Options and (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount (as defined
below) over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock previously
subject to such option plus, if applicable, the per share cash value of the
Additional Merger Consideration such holder would have received if such
holder had exercised his or her Company Options prior to the Effective Time,
less any applicable tax withholding (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to collectively as
the &#147;Option Payments&#148;). From and after the Effective Time, any such cancelled
Company Options shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof,
but shall only entitle such holder, subject to receipt by the Exchange Agent
(as defined in Section 1.9(a)) of the surrendered Company Option agreement,
together with a written instrument, reasonably satisfactory to Acquisition Co.,
duly executed by the holder of such Company Option, representing that (i) he,
she or it is the owner of all Company Options represented by such Company
Option agreement and (ii) a confirmation of, and consent to, the cancellation
of all of his, her or its Options, to the payment of the applicable Option
Payments. After the Effective Time, all Company Option Plans shall be
terminated and no further or other rights with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock shall be granted thereunder. The &#147;Per Share Amount&#148; shall be
$7.50, subject to the per share amount of any reduction pursuant to the
provisions of Section 1.3(a) in the Cash Consideration. As provided in Section
1.3(a), if the Additional Merger Consideration is payable to holders of Company
Common Stock, then upon the determination such payment is due, Acquisition Co.
shall pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, to each holder of a
Company Option cancelled pursuant to this Agreement who was entitled to a
payment pursuant to this Section 1.4, a payment equal to the amount of
Additional Merger consideration he or she would have received if such holder
had exercised his or her Company Options prior to the Effective Time, less any
applicable tax withholding.</FONT></P>

receiving the notice from Acquisition Co. contemplated by Section 1.3(l) above

the disagreement within three (3) days of the notice or submit the calculation
of Additional Merger Consideration to an independent certified public

the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) did not contain any qualifications or exceptions
to the matters certified therein, except as otherwise permitted under the

liquidated damages to compensate Acquisition Co. for the damages Acquisition

Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) shall be paid
prior to or contemporaneously with, and shall be a pre-condition to the
effectiveness of, termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f). Any
payment required to be made pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(ii) and (iii) shall be
paid not later than two (2) business days after the date of termination. All
payments under this Section 7.2(b) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Acquisition Co. Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, Acquisition Co. would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly,
if Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.2
and, in order to obtain such payment, Acquisition Co. commences a suit which
results in a judgment against Company for the fee set forth in this Section
7.2, Company shall pay to Acquisition Co. its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee at the prime rate in effect
on the date such payment is required to be made, as liquidated damages. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Termination Fee is intended in part to compensate for all
reasonable costs and expenses of Acquisition Co. in connection with this
Agreement, if a Termination Fee is payable and as such represents an exception
to Section 7.3 but shall not create any other duty or obligation to pay such
costs or expenses if no Termination Fee is payable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation shall, and does hereby, indemnify to the fullest extent permitted
or authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law or judicial or
administrative decisions, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or
interpreted differently in the future (but, in the case of any such amendment
or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation
permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than
permitted prior thereto), each person (including the current and future heirs,
beneficiaries, personal representatives and estate of such person) who was or
is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, or was or is a witness, to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (a &#147;Proceeding&#148;) and whether the
basis of such Proceeding is an allegation of an action in an official capacity
of such person related to the Corporation or any other capacity while such
person is serving as an officer, director, employee or agent of the
Corporation, against any liability (which for purposes of this Article shall
include any judgment, settlement, penalty or fine) or cost, charge or expense
(including attorneys&#146; fees) asserted against him or incurred by him by reason
of the fact that such indemnified person (1) is or was a director, officer or
employee of the Corporation or (2) is or was an agent of the Corporation as to
whom the Corporation, by action of its Board of Directors, has agreed to grant</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT  SIZE=2>-2-</FONT></P>

<HR COLOR=#000000 NOSHADE><P STYLE='PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: ALWAYS'></P><PAGE>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>such indemnity
or (3) is or was serving, at the request of the Corporation, as a director,
officer or employee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise (including serving as a fiduciary of any employee benefit
plan) or (4) is or was serving as an agent of such other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise described in clause (3)
hereof as to whom the Corporation, by action of its Board of Directors, has
agreed to grant such indemnity. Each director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation to whom indemnification rights under this Section 1 of this
Article have been granted shall be referred to as an &#147;Indemnified Person.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
the foregoing, except as specified in Section 3 of this Article, the
Corporation shall not be required to indemnify an Indemnified Person in connection
with a Proceeding (or any part thereof) initiated by such Indemnified Person
unless such authorization for such Proceeding (or any part thereof) was not
denied by the Board of Directors of the Corporation prior to sixty (60) days
after receipt of notice thereof from such Indemnified Person stating his intent
to initiate such Proceeding and only upon such terms and conditions as the
Board of Directors may deem appropriate. </FONT></P>

administrative decisions, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or
interpreted differently in the future (but, in the case of any such future
amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or

behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay all amounts so advanced in the event
that it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision that such
person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in
this Article and upon such other terms and conditions, in the case of an agent
as to whom the Corporation has agreed to grant such indemnity, as the Board of
Directors may deem appropriate. The Corporation may, upon approval of the
Indemnified Person, authorize the Corporation&#146;s counsel to represent such person
in any Proceeding, whether or not the Corporation is a party to such
Proceeding. Such authorization may be made by the Board of Directors by
majority vote, including directors who are parties to such Proceeding. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
Procedure for Indemnification </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
indemnification or advance under this Article shall be made promptly and in any
event within sixty (60) days upon the written request of the Indemnified Person
(except in the case of a claim for an advancement of costs, charges or expenses,
in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days). The right to
indemnification or advances as granted by this Article shall be enforceable by
the Indemnified Person in any court of competent jurisdiction if the
Corporation denies such request under this Article, in whole or in part, or if
no disposition thereof is made within sixty (60) days or twenty (20) days, as
may be applicable. Such Indemnified Person&#146;s costs and expenses incurred in
connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification or
advancement of costs, charges or expenses, in whole or in part, in any such
action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to
any such action that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct, if any, required
by the Delaware General Corporation Law or judicial or administrative
decisions, as the same exists or</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT  SIZE=2>-4-</FONT></P>

<HR COLOR=#000000 NOSHADE><P STYLE='PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: ALWAYS'></P><PAGE>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>may hereafter
be amended or interpreted differently in the future (but, in the case of any
such future amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment
or interpretation does not impose a more stringent standard of conduct than
permitted prior thereto), but the burden of proving such defense shall be on
the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors or any committee thereof, its independent legal counsel, and its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of the claimant or advancement for the claimant is
proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of
conduct, if any, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by
the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or any committee thereof, its
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create
a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Indemnification</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
indemnification and advancement provided by this Article shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those Indemnified Persons may be
entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors
or recommendation of counsel or otherwise, both as to actions in such person&#146;s
official capacity and as to actions in any other capacity while holding such
office or position, and shall continue as to an Indemnified Person who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, beneficiaries, personal representatives and the estate of
such person. All rights to indemnification and advancement under this Article
shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each Indemnified
Person who serves or served in such capacity at any time while this Article is
in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Article or any repeal or</FONT></P>

of relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law or any other
applicable laws shall not in any way diminish any rights to indemnification of
such Indemnified Person, or the obligations of the Corporation arising
hereunder, for claims relating to matters occurring prior to such repeal or
modification. </FONT></P>

Insurance</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is
or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise (including serving as a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan)
against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such
capacity or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the
provisions of this Article or the applicable provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
Savings Clause </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any
court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless
indemnify and advance costs to each Indemnified Person as to costs, charges and
expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement with respect to any Proceeding, including an action by or in the
right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable
portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and as permitted
by the Delaware General Corporation Law. </FONT></P>

its stockholders for any monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duty as a</FONT></P>

provided that this provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a
director (i) for any breach of the director&#146;s duty of loyalty to the
Corporation or its stockholders; (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith
or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii)
under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; or
(iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
benefit. No repeal or amendment of this Article shall adversely affect any
rights of any person pursuant to this Article which existed at the time of such
repeal or amendment with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such
repeal or amendment.</FONT></P>

In consideration of the issuance of common stock of Acquisition Co. in exchange
for the Subject Shares (the &#147;Acquisition Co. Shares&#148;) to each of the
Stockholders pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and of other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby

each Stockholder agrees that, during the period beginning from the Effective
Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and continuing for ninety (90) days
thereafter (as the same may be extended pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2(a), the
&#147;Release Date&#148;) (the &#147;Lock-up Period&#148;), each Stockholder will not, directly or

2(a), at the request of underwriters or the managing underwriter in connection
with a proposed transaction or public offering by the Company, each Stockholder
will agree to extend the Lock-up Period for a term consistent with the period
for which the Chief Executive Officer of Acquisition Co. enters into an

Stockholders from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is
designed to, or reasonably expected to lead to, or result in, a sale or
disposition of the Acquisition Co. Shares even if such shares would be disposed

Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions on transfer, each Stockholder may
transfer all or any part of his Acquisition Co. Shares (i) to the other
Stockholder (provided, however, that no transfer may be in respect of any
Contingent Share Rights); (ii) by will or intestacy, (iii) to any trust for the
direct or indirect benefit of such Stockholder or the immediate family of such
Stockholder, provided that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition
for value, or (iii) in a private transaction prior to the Release Date so long
as the acquirer of Acquisition Co. Shares, by written agreement with
Acquisition Co. entered into at the time of acquisition and delivered to
Acquisition Co. prior to the consummation of such acquisition, agrees to be
bound by the restrictions set forth herein. For purposes of this letter
agreement, &#147;immediate family&#148; shall mean any relationship by blood, marriage or
adoption, not more remote than first cousin. Any Stockholder may pledge
Acquisition Co. Shares to secure indebtedness incurred by such Stockholder (in
such amount as is necessary to pay taxes or estimated taxes related to the
Merger), such pledge to be subject to the prior written approval of Acquisition
Co., which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.</FONT></P>

other agreement to which either of the Stockholders is a party or under
applicable securities laws.</FONT></P>

Board of Directors withdraws its recommendation of the Merger and terminates
the Merger Agreement.</FONT></P>

<U>Covenant of Acquisition Co. Regarding Additional Merger Consideration.</U>
Acquisition Co. recognizes that the Stockholders may lose the intended benefit
of the Additional Merger Consideration (as provided in the Merger Agreement) if
the circumstances causing the Contingent Share Rights to become void occur
during the period prior to the Release Date. In such event, Acquisition Co.
agrees to promptly thereafter issue to each Stockholder the Additional Merger
Consideration attributable to such Stockholder&#146;s Company Common Stock unless
the circumstances causing the Contingent Share Rights to become void are
satisfied following the Release Date (including any extension of the Lock-up
Period under Section&nbsp;2(a) of this Agreement).</FONT></P>

<U>Amendments and Waivers</U>. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended
or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement, or in the
case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by law, (a) no
waiver that may be given by a party shall be applicable except in the specific
instance for which it was given and (b) no notice to or demand on one party shall
be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or the right of the
party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or
demand.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registration
Rights Agreement</B> (this &#147;Agreement&#148;), dated as of
____________, 2006, by and among Iconix Brand Group, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), Edwin Lewis and Mossimo Giannulli (each, a &#147;Holder&#148;).</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT  SIZE=2><B>RECITALS</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
</B>the Company is concurrently herewith entering into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), with Moss Acquisition
Corp., Mossimo Giannulli, and Mossimo, Inc.; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
</B>pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company will
prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;)
a registration statement on Form S-4 in connection with the registration under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), of shares (the
&#147;Shares&#148;) of the Company&#146;s common stock, par value $.001 per share, to be
issued to the stockholders of Mossimo, Inc., including each Holder (to the
extent such Holder at the Effective Time of the Merger owns shares of Mossimo,
Inc. common stock), in connection with the merger of Mossimo, Inc. with and
into Moss Acquisition Corp. (the &#147;Merger Registration Statement&#148;); and</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
</B>pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company has
agreed to grant to each Holder the registration rights set forth herein with
respect to the Shares, any securities issued in exchange for or in replacement
of the Shares, and any securities issued by way of any stock split, reverse
stock split, recapitalization, or other similar transaction affecting the
Shares or any such other securities, and any shares of the Company&#146;s common
stock issued to Holder as Additional Merger Consideration (collectively, the
&#147;Registrable Securities&#148;). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE</B>, intending to be legally bound, the parties
hereto agree as follows. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the

<U>Merger Registration Statement</U>. The Company acknowledges, and agrees to

<P><FONT

If, at any time after the date hereof, the Company proposes to prepare and file
with the Commission a registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form
thereto) covering only the resale of equity securities of the Company held by
its stockholders, the Company will give written notice of its intention to do
so to the Holders at least ten (10) days prior to the filing of each such
registration statement. Upon the written request of the Holders, made within
five (5) days after receipt of the notice, that the Company include any of the</FONT></P>

<HR COLOR=#000000 NOSHADE><P STYLE='PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: ALWAYS'></P><PAGE>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Registrable
Securities in the proposed registration statement, the Company shall, as to the
Holders, use reasonable best efforts to effect the registration under the Act
of such Registrable Securities which it has been so requested to register (the
&#147;Piggyback Registration&#148;);</FONT></P>

<P><FONT
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the right to Piggyback
Registration shall not apply, unless the Company otherwise agrees in writing,
to any registration statement: (i) relating to an underwritten public offering
of securities of the Company; (ii) relating solely to securities of the Company
to be offered pursuant to (x) an employee benefit plan, or (y) a dividend or
interest reinvestment plan (including such a plan that has an open enrollment
or cash investment feature); (iii) relating to securities of the Company to be
issued for a consideration other than solely cash; (iv) relating to securities
of the Company to be offered solely to existing security holders of the
Company, through a &#147;rights offering&#148; or otherwise; (v) relating solely to
securities of the Company to be issued on the exercise of options, warrants and
similar rights, or on the conversion or exchange of other securities, issued by
the Company or any other person; (vi) relating to debt securities of the
Company, including debt securities that are convertible or exchangeable for
equity securities of the Company; or (vii) that may become effective
automatically upon filing with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462 under the
Act or otherwise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section, the Company shall
have the right to elect not to file or to defer the filing of any proposed registration
statement or to withdraw the same after the filing but prior to the effective
date thereof.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
At any time commencing on the first date the prospectus forming a part of the
Merger Registration Statement is no longer current and available for use by a
Holder for resales of Registrable Securities because the financial statements
included in the prospectus forming a part thereof no longer satisfy the
requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act, the Holders may
collectively, on one occasion only, submit to the Company a joint written
notice (the &#147;Demand Registration Request&#148;), to have the Company use its
reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the Commission, at the sole
expense of the Company (except as hereinafter provided), in respect of up to
the aggregate number of Registrable Securities not at such time covered in an
effective registration statement filed by the Company pursuant to Section 2, a
registration statement so as to permit a public offering and sale of such
Registrable Securities until, subject to the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, the earlier of the date on which: (i) all Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement, or other registration statements filed
by the Company, have been sold pursuant thereto or otherwise lawfully sold
without registration under the Securities Act; or (ii) all of the remaining
Registrable Securities may be publicly sold without volume restrictions
pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act, as determined by written
opinion of counsel to the Company on which Holders are expressly entitled to
rely (the &#147;Effectiveness Period&#148;). The registration statement filed following a
Demand Registration Request shall be on any form the Company is eligible to use
to register for resale the Registrable Securities. The Company shall, upon
receipt of a Demand Registration Request, use its reasonable best effort to
cause to be registered under the Securities Act as soon as practicable
thereafter all of the Registrable Securities that Holders have so requested to
be registered.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT  SIZE=2>-2-</FONT></P>

<P><FONT
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at the
time a Demand Registration Request is given to the Company under Section 3
hereof (i) the Company is engaged in negotiations with respect to an
acquisition, merger, financing or other material event which would require the
Company to file a Form 8-K in the event that such acquisition, merger,
financing or other material event is consummated or has otherwise occurred, or
(ii) the Company is otherwise unable to obtain information required to be
included in the registration statement to be filed or (iii) in the event the
Company shall furnish to the Holders a certificate signed by the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company stating that in the good faith judgment of the
Company and its investment banker that it would be detrimental to the Company
and its stockholders for the Company to immediately proceed with a registration
statement and it is therefore essential to defer the filing of such
registration statement or any amendment thereto, then, in each such case, the
Company will have the right to defer such filing for a period not to exceed one
hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the Demand Registration Request;
provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any
registration statement filed pursuant to this Section 3 to become effective as
soon as practicable after such deferral period, and provided further that the
Company may not delay any registration requested pursuant to this Section 3
more than once during any twelve-month period. Moreover, if the Company is
proceeding with the registration process but the registration statement is
subject to review by the Commission and/or audited financial statements for a
fiscal year are required to be included but not yet available, the Company may
elect to defer filing for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
Nothing herein contained shall require the Company to undergo an audit, other
than in the ordinary course of business.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
<U>Covenants of the Company.</U> The Company hereby covenants and agrees as
follows:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
In accordance with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated

Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the
Commission a registration statement as expeditiously as reasonably possible.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
Not less than two business days prior to the filing of a registration statement
or any related prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish to
the Holders copies of all such documents proposed to be filed which documents
will be subject to the review of the Holders and the counsel to the Holders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
Use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the Commission such
amendments, including post-effective amendments, to the registration statement
and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep the
registration statement continuously effective as to the applicable Registrable
Securities for the Effectiveness Period in the case of a Demand Registration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Notify the

person was not sent or given a prospectus by or on behalf of the Holder, if
required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written
confirmation of the sale of the Registrable Securities to such person, and if
the prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect
giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, unless such failure
is the result of noncompliance by the Company or based upon the Holder&#146;s use of

the prospectus has been suspended. Such indemnity shall remain in full force

any directors, officers, participating person, or controlling person thereof,

Holder shall at the same time indemnify the Company, its directors, each
officer signing a registration statement and each person who controls the
Company within the meaning of the Act from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages and liabilities caused by or arising out of any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a

damages, liabilities, or expenses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnitor on the one hand and
the indemnitee on the other from the registration, or (ii) if the allocation
provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, or provides a
lesser sum to the indemnitee than the amount hereinafter calculated, in such

assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all reasonable fees

however, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall

promptly to assume the defense of such proceeding and to employ counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such proceeding; or
(iii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded
parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and
such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that representation
of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable
ethical legal standards due to actual or potential interests between them, (in
which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in
writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, such counsel shall be at the reasonable expense of the
Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that in no event shall the Indemnifying
Party be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one separate
counsel). The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any
such proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending
proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party, unless such
settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.</FONT></P>
