 |  

Recovery under other rights and reimbursement 

---|--- 
 



      |  

(a)

 |  

The Sellers are not liable under a Claim for any Loss to the extent that a
Buyer Group Member or a Target Entity is entitled on an after-Tax basis to
recover, or be compensated for by any Third Party any Loss from another source
(including under a policy of insurance or from a Governmental Agency). 

---|---|--- 
 



      |  

(b)

 |  

If, after a Seller has made a payment in respect of a Claim, a Buyer Group
Member or a Target Entity recovers or is compensated for by any other means
(including receipt of any benefit referred to in clause 9.12), any Loss that
gave rise to the Claim, the Buyer must immediately pay to the Seller as an

entitled to make a claim under a Transaction Agreement from commencing that
claim. However, if for any reason more than one amount is paid in respect of

not omit, and procure that no other Buyer Group Member or Target Entity omits,
to take any reasonable action that would mitigate any Loss that may give rise

(b)

 |

      |  

(B)

 |

Demand shall not apply and the Buyer shall (without prejudice to its rights

Calculation of the EBITDA Less Capital Expenditures

4.2

 |  

Specific principles 

---|--- 
 



      |  

(a)

 |  

Where Related Party Transactions occur in the Earn-Out Period, only so much of
the revenue earned or expenses incurred by the Earn-Out Group as it would be

---|---|--- 
 



      |

 |

Buyer or the Buyer's Guarantor must inform the Sellers of that proposed
Acquisition and the Sellers can elect either to: 

---|---|--- 
 



      |  

(1)

 |  

include the Potential Earn-Out Group Member in the Earn-Out Group for the
purposes of calculating EBITDA Less Capital Expenditures, in which case the
purchase price associated with the Acquisition forms part of the capital
expenditures comprising the EBITDA Less Capital Expenditures; or 

---|---|--- 
 



      |  

(2)

 |  

exclude the Potential Earn-Out Group Member from the Earn-Out Group for the
purposes of calculating EBITDA Less Capital Expenditures, in which case the
purchase price associated with the Acquisition will not form part of the
capital expenditures comprising the EBITDA Less Capital Expenditures, 

---|---|--- 
 



 

for the duration of the Earn-Out Period.
