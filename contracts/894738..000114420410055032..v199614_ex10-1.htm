Statement"), prepared using the same accounting methods, practices,

Buyer does not give written notice of any exception within 30 days after the

Section 3.06 Financial Statements.  Complete copies of the carve-out
consolidated audited financial statements consisting of the balance sheet of
the Business as of December 31 in each of the years 2009 and 2008 and the
related statements of income and retained earnings, and cash flow for the
years then ended (the "Audited Financial Statements"), and unaudited
financial statements consisting of the carve-out consolidated balance sheet
of the Business as of June 30, 2010 and the related statements of income and
retained earnings, equity interestholders' equity and cash flow for the six
month period then ended (the "Interim Financial Statements" and together with
the Audited Financial Statements, the "Financial Statements") have been
delivered to Buyer. The Financial Statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the carve-out consolidated financial position of the Business, in
conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the period
involved, subject, in the case of the Interim Financial Statements, to normal
and recurring year-end adjustments (the effect of which will not
be materially adverse) and the absence of notes (that, if presented, would
not differ materially from those presented in the Audited Financial
Statements). The Financial Statements are based on the books and records of
Sellers and their Affiliates that pertain to the Business in all material
respects, and may not necessarily be indicative of the conditions that would
have existed or the results of operations of the Business if the Business had
been operated through unaffiliated entities of Parent. Consistent with carve-
out financial statements, portions of certain income and expenses represent
allocations made from Parent that are directly attributable to the Business.
The carve-out consolidated balance sheet of the Business as of December 31,
2009 is referred to herein as the "Balance Sheet" and the date thereof as
the "Balance Sheet Date" and the carve-out consolidated balance sheet of the
Business as of June 30, 2010 is referred to herein as the "Interim Balance
Sheet" and the date thereof as the "Interim Balance Sheet Date". The Company
maintains a standard system of accounting established and administered in
accordance with GAAP. Parent has established and maintains a system of
"internal controls over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) with respect to Parent and its Affiliates
on a consolidated basis; provided, however, that Sellers make
no representation, implied or otherwise, as to any system of "internal
controls over financial reporting" maintained by or applicable to any or all
of the Acquired Companies on a carve-out basis.

Covenants

 

 

Section 5.01 Confidentiality. From and for a period of five (5) years after
the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, hold, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Representatives and their Affiliates' respective Representatives to hold, in
confidence any and all Confidential Information, whether written or oral,
concerning the Acquired Companies or the Assets, except: (a) to the extent
that disclosure is necessary to manage Parent's or its Affiliates'
relationships with its commercial partners, including its vendors (including
benefit providers and insurers), customers, analysts, creditors and potential
creditors and landlords; (b) to the extent that Sellers can show that such
information (i) is generally available to and known by the public through no
fault of any of Sellers, any of their Affiliates or their
respective Representatives (other than as a disclosure required by Law); or

judgment that disclosure is required by any applicable rule or regulation of
the Securities Exchange Commission or applicable securities exchange),
Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and cooperate with Buyer, at
Buyer's expense, in seeking a protective order or other limits on the
requested disclosure of Confidential Information. Sellers shall disclose only
that portion of such information which Sellers are advised by their counsel
is legally required to be disclosed. "Confidential Information" shall mean
any and all valuable and/or proprietary information (in oral, written,
electronic or other forms) belonging or pertaining to the Acquired Companies
or relating to the Business or the Assets that would be useful to competitors
of the Acquired Companies or the Business or otherwise damaging to the
Acquired Companies or the Business if disclosed, including, but not
limited to, budgets, capital spending plans, business plans, the names and

unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

---|---|--- 
   

 

 

(v) Buyer acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section
5.02(b) are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of
Sellers and constitute a material inducement to Sellers to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
the event that any covenant contained in this Section 5.02(b) should ever be

unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

the covenants is not enjoined from breaching any of the covenants, then if a
court of competent jurisdiction finds that the challenged covenant is
enforceable, the time periods shall be deemed tolled upon the filing of the
lawsuit challenging the enforceability of Section 5.02 until the dispute is
finally resolved and all periods of appeal have expired.

 

 

Section 5.03 Consents. If any consent, approval or authorization necessary

Companies relating to periods prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably
consistent with the prior practices of the Acquired Companies; and

during normal business hours, to such books and records;

 

 

provided, however, that any books and records related to Tax matters shall be
retained pursuant to the periods set forth in Article VI.

 

 

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made by or against or
incurred by Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies after the Closing, or for
any other reasonable purpose, for a period of three years following the

Companies and their operations for periods prior to the Closing; and

 

 

(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Representatives of Buyer or the
Acquired Companies reasonable access (including the right to make, at Buyer's
expense, photocopies), during normal business hours, to such books
and records;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided, however, that any books and records related to Tax matters shall be
retained pursuant to the periods set forth in Article VI.

 

 

(c) Neither Buyer nor any Seller shall be obligated to provide the other
party with access to any books or records (including personnel files)
pursuant to this Section 5.04 where such access would violate any Law or
other obligation of confidentiality.

 

 

Section 5.05 Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law or stock exchange requirements (based upon the reasonable advice of
counsel), the parties shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any
public announcements in respect of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and other communications with any news media.

 

 

Section 5.06 License Grant. The Company hereby grants, and each of Buyer and
the Company shall cause the other Acquired Companies to grant, in each case
as of the date hereof, to Sellers and their Affiliates a non-exclusive,
perpetual, royalty-free, fully-paid, worldwide, non-transferable, non-
assignable, non-licensable, non-sub-licensable (other than: (a) licenses to
end users of Sellers' services as part of an end user agreement which
licenses do not permit re-license, sub-license or assignment of such
licenses; and (b) licenses to Sellers' and their Affiliates' resellers but
only in connection with the reselling of Sellers' services pursuant to
licenses to end users of Sellers' services as part of an end user agreement
which licenses do not permit re-license, sub-license or assignment of such
licenses) license to all patents and patent applications owned by
such Acquired Company as of the date hereof, and all patents subsequently
issued in respect of such patent applications, in all cases other than for
use in the Restricted Business. The license(s) granted pursuant to this
Section 5.06 shall survive any subsequent transfer of any such patent or
patent application following the Closing, but shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 5.02.

 

 

Section 5.07 Seller Corporate Guaranties.

 

 

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause each of the
Acquired Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
release of Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other than an Acquired
Company) from each and every guaranty (whether provided as a guaranty or
letter of credit) of the performance of any Acquired Company under any
contract to which an Acquired Company is a party, including those set forth
on Section 5.07 of the Disclosure Schedules (each, a "Corporate Guaranty").
The parties acknowledge that commercially reasonable efforts shall include,
for any Corporate Guaranty which is a letter of credit, substituting Buyer
for any Seller as the provider of a substitute letter of credit to replace
such Seller as the provider of such Corporate Guaranty. In furtherance of the
foregoing, within thirty (30) days following the Closing, the Buyer shall, or
shall cause the Company to, cause Parent to be named as a named additional
insured on all insurance policies that Buyer or the Company are required to
maintain in connection with the Company's facility located at 100 Tormee

Company's obligations under the lease for such facility.

 

 

(b) The Acquired Companies shall, and Buyer and the Company shall cause each
Acquired Company to, perform all obligations under any contract for which any
Seller or any of its Affiliates may then be liable pursuant to a Corporate
Guaranty (each, a "Guarantied Contract"). Following the Closing, the
Acquired Companies shall not, and Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies
not to, extend the term, increase the obligations under or otherwise modify
any Guarantied Contract without the prior written consent of the applicable
Seller, which may be withheld in its sole discretion.

Section 5.08 Further Assurances; Mansell Earn-Out.

 

 

(a) Following the Closing, each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver such additional
documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and take such further
actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions hereof and
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, it is the parties' intent that all of the
assets constituting the Business contained in the Acquired Companies as of
the Closing and the Assets (but none of the assets constituting the
Conferencing Business that are not used primarily as part of the Business) be
transferred to Buyer pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby. As
such, each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, take all commercially reasonable best efforts and execute and
deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances
and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to ensure that
any asset constituting part of the Conferencing Business (and which asset is
not used primarily as part of the Business) which is inadvertently
transferred to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement be transferred promptly back
to the applicable Seller for no further consideration. After the Closing,
Buyer agrees to complete the transfer to the applicable Seller of any cash
that was in transit to such Seller on or before the Closing Date.

 

 

(b) The Company hereby assigns to Parent, for no additional consideration,
all of the Company's rights to the "Supplemental Purchase Price Payment" (as
such term is defined in that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of
November 5, 2009, between the Company and Mansell Group, Inc. (the "Mansell
SPA")). In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company hereby assigns to Parent
all of its rights under Section 1.4 of the Mansell SPA in order to collect
any Supplemental Purchase Price Payment. To the extent requested by Parent,
and at Parent's expense, Buyer shall forward all communications with Mansell
Group, Inc. related to the Supplemental Purchase Price Payment to Parent,
including the Supplemental Purchase Price Statement (as defined in the
Mansell SPA), and shall communicate with Mansell Group, Inc. on Parent's
behalf and as directed by Parent. Should the final determination of the
Supplemental Purchase Price require arbitration or other legal proceeding
under the Mansell SPA, the Company shall, at Parent's expense, act as
Parent's nominee in asserting all claims related to the receipt of the
Supplemental Purchase Price Payment. Upon the Company's or any of its
Affiliate's receipt of the Supplemental Purchase Price Payment, such Person
promptly shall forward the same to Parent. Except as expressly set forth in
this Section 5.08(b), the Company is not assigning or otherwise transferring
any other rights, obligations or Liabilities under or related to the Mansell
SPA.

 

 

Section 5.09 [Intentionally Omitted].

Section 5.10 Post-Closing Cooperation. Following the Closing, each of the
parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with any Actions which may or may come to exist against
a requesting party by any third party. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Action and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis.

 

 

Section 5.11 Employee Matters.

 

 

(a) Bonuses / Commissions. On the next regularly scheduled payroll date after
the final determination of the bonuses and commissions to which any Employee
or independent contractor of any of the Acquired Companies is eligible, Buyer
and the Company shall cause each Acquired Company to pay all such bonuses
and commissions to the proper recipients thereof, in each case to the extent
such bonuses and commissions are accrued on the Working Capital Statement.

 

 

(b) Benefits. Buyer shall: (i) recognize the service of the Acquired
Companies' Employees with Sellers or the applicable Acquired Company as of
the Closing Date for purposes of determining eligibility and vesting (but not
benefit accruals) under Buyer's 401(k) and profit sharing plans to the same
extent credited by the Acquired Companies (except to the extent that such
prior service credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same
period of service); (ii) waive with respect to such Employees and covered
dependents all waiting periods and pre-existing condition exclusions for
purposes of determining eligibility and coverage under Buyer's medical,
dental, prescription drug and vision benefit plans to the same extent waived
under the applicable Benefit Plan; (iii) cause any eligible expenses (other
than contributions to spending accounts) incurred by any such Employee and
his or her covered dependents under Sellers' group health plans (during the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs) to be taken into account
under the analogous group health plans of Buyer in which such Employee and
his or her covered dependents may participate (on or after the Closing Date)
for purposes of satisfying any deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Employee and his or her covered
dependents under the analogous group health plans of Buyer for the remainder
of such calendar year, provided (A) the Employee and his or her dependents
satisfy the terms and conditions to receive such credit under the analogous
group health plans of Buyer, and Sellers certify (or cause their health plan
providers to certify) that such Employee had continuous creditable coverage
for the twelve (12) months prior to the Closing Date, (B) Buyer is able to
reasonably verify that such eligible expenses were incurred and paid, and
(C) taking such eligible expenses into account does not result in a
duplication of benefits; and (iv) provide severance benefits to any
U.S.-based Employee, for a period not less than one year following the
Closing, that are comparable to the severance benefits available to such
Employee immediately prior to the Closing under the severance pay policy of
Parent. Buyer also will take all actions reasonably necessary to cause each
Buyer's 401(k) or profit sharing plan to accept direct rollovers of such
Employees' account balances under Parent's 401(k) plan, provided that such
distribution constitutes an "eligible rollover distribution".

 

 

Section 5.12 Change of Name. Within ten (10) Business Days following the
Closing, the Company shall (and shall cause the Acquired Companies to) file
any necessary documents with all appropriate Governmental Authorities (both
where such Acquired Company is formed as well as where such Acquired Company
is authorized to do business) to change any Acquired Company's name (or
d/b/a, if applicable) that includes "Premiere," "PGI" or "PTEK" or any
similar name to a name dissimilar to "Premiere," "PGI" or "PTEK".
Section 5.12 of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth a list of all
registered d/b/a names for each of the Acquired Companies and the relevant
jurisdictions in which such d/b/a names are registered.

Section 5.14 Retained Matter. Notwithstanding anything in Article VIII to
the contrary, Sellers shall control the contest or resolution of the
Retained Matter. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties acknowledge
that Sellers and their Representatives may require extensive access to the
employees, books and records of the Acquired Companies to properly defend the
Acquired Companies in connection with the Retained Matter. The parties
agree that, to the extent required by Sellers, Buyer shall (and shall cause
the Acquired Companies to) provide Sellers and their Representatives,
promptly upon request, reasonable access to the books and records, including
call detail records, of the Acquired Companies related to the Retained Matter
or other information reasonably necessary to the defense thereof, at Sellers'
sole expense. To the extent requested by Sellers and at Sellers'
sole expense, Buyer shall appoint an individual who shall devote such time as
is necessary to provide Sellers and their Representatives all such
information reasonably requested by them. Sellers' obligation to indemnify
Buyer and the Acquired Companies from any Losses arising out of or related to
the Retained Matter shall be contingent upon Buyer's compliance in all
material respects with this Section 5.14.

 

 

Section 5.15 Release and Assumption of Certain Liabilities. Promptly
following the Closing (but in any event within twenty (20) Business Days
thereafter), Sellers shall, or shall cause their Affiliates, as applicable,
to, (a) irrevocably and unconditionally release all Acquired Companies from
(i) all Liabilities related to any assets of the Conferencing Business
transferred from an Acquired Company to Parent or any Affiliate of Parent
that is not an Acquired Company as part of the Pre-Closing Restructuring (to
the extent that such Liabilities are not deducted from Working Capital under
Section 2.03), and (ii) any indemnification obligations arising in
connection with such transfers, and (b) assume all Liabilities described in
clause (a)(i) of this Section 5.15.

(a) Without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed, Sellers shall not, to the
extent it may affect, or relate to, any of the Acquired Companies, the
Business or the Assets, make, change or rescind any Tax election or amend any
Tax Return (unless otherwise required by Law).

 

 

(b) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
(including any real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be

(c) With respect to any Tax Return of any Acquired Company or related to the
Business or the Assets for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Tax Return
of any Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period that is part of a
Straddle Period): (i) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, such Tax Return in accordance with the past
practice of the Acquired Company or Canada Holdco, as applicable, (unless
otherwise required by Law) and pay all applicable Taxes; (ii) with respect to
any such Tax Return that is a separate company Tax Return that is required to
be filed after the Closing Date, Parent shall let Buyer review and comment on
such Tax Return within a reasonable time prior to the due date (taking
extensions into account) for the filing of such Tax Return, and shall
promptly after filing such Tax Return provide, or cause to be provided, to
Buyer a copy of such Tax Return; (iii) with respect to any such Tax Return
that is a separate company return, no position shall be taken on such Tax
Return (unless otherwise required by Law) that would result in a
material adverse effect to any Acquired Company or Buyer, as applicable, for
a Tax period beginning after the Closing Date, without the prior written
consent of Buyer, with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed; and (iv) with respect to any such Tax Return of any
Acquired Company that is not a separate company return, such Acquired Company
shall furnish Tax information to Parent or UK Holdco, as applicable, for
inclusion in the consolidated income Tax Return of Parent or UK Holdco for
the period that includes the Closing Date, in accordance past practice. For
purposes of clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, a position on a Tax
Return that "results in a material adverse effect to any Acquired Company or
Buyer, as applicable, for a Tax period beginning after the Closing Date"
shall be a position that results in additional Tax in an amount of $100,000
or more in a Tax period beginning after the Closing Date.

 

 

(d) With respect to any Tax Return of any Acquired Company for a Straddle
Period: (i) such Tax Return shall be prepared, or caused to be prepared, and
timely filed by Buyer in accordance with the Acquired Company's past practice
(unless otherwise required by Law); and (ii) Sellers shall be liable for the
Pre-Closing Taxes and Buyer shall be liable for the Post-Closing Taxes
payable with respect to such Tax Return, as determined in accordance with
Section 6.04. Buyer shall submit such Tax Return to Parent within a
reasonable period of time prior to the due date of such Tax Return (taking
extensions into account). If there is any dispute between Parent and Buyer
regarding any item on such Tax Return, the parties shall in good
faith attempt to resolve the dispute within a reasonable time prior to the
due date of the Tax Return (taking extensions into account). Any such
resolution shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. Any
unresolved disputes shall be promptly submitted to an independent accounting
firm mutually acceptable to Parent and Buyer (the "Accounting Referee")
for determination prior to the filing of such Tax Return, with such
determination being final and binding on the parties hereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.01(d), if there is
no resolution of the disputed items by the due date of a Tax Return (taking
extensions into account), then Buyer shall file or cause to be filed such Tax
Return by the due date (taking extensions into account) in the form prepared
by Buyer; provided, however, that within a reasonable period of time after
there is a determination by the Accounting Referee, Buyer shall prepare and
file an amended Tax Return, if necessary, in accordance with the
determination of the Accounting Referee, and there shall be an attendant
true-up payment between Sellers and Buyer as to the payment of Taxes relating
to such amended Tax Return to the extent that the respective Taxes payable by
Sellers and Buyers pursuant to this Section 6.01(d) with respect to the
amended Tax Return varies from the respective Taxes payable by Sellers and
Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.01(d) with respect to the originally filed
Tax Return. Parent on the one hand and Buyer on the other hand will each pay
one-half of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) All Tax Returns of each Acquired Company not described in paragraphs (b),
(c) or (d) of this Section 6.01 shall be prepared and timely filed by or at
the direction of Buyer.

 

 

Section 6.02 Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all
existing Tax sharing agreements (whether written or not) binding upon any of
the Acquired Companies or relating to the Business or the Assets shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date. After such date none of the Acquired
Companies, Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives shall have any further rights or
liabilities thereunder

 

 

Section 6.03 Tax Indemnification.  Sellers, jointly and severally, agree to
indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee for, and to hold such Buyer Indemnitee
harmless from and against: (a) any Losses of such Buyer Indemnitee
attributable to any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
made in Section 3.22; (b) any Losses of such Buyer Indemnitee attributable to
any breach or violation of, or failure to fully perform, any covenant,
agreement, undertaking or obligation in Article VI; and (c) all Pre-Closing
Taxes (including, without limitation, all Pre-Closing Taxes related to the NJ
Tax Matter or issues arising under or out of the NJ Tax Matter); provided,
however, that no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under
this Section 6.03 for any Losses or Taxes that were a deduction from Working
Capital set forth in Section 2.03; provided, further, that any amount payable
under this Section 6.03 by Sellers shall be reduced by an amount equal to any
Tax benefit realized by such Buyer Indemnitee arising from or related to the
incurrence or payment of such Losses or Taxes, and increased by any Tax
detriment associated with the receipt, or right to receive indemnification
hereunder; and to the extent the Buyer Indemnitee recognizes a Tax benefit in
a year after the receipt of the indemnification payment pursuant to this
Section 6.03, the Buyer Indemnitee shall pay the amount of such Tax benefit
to the Indemnifying Party as such Tax benefits are recognized by the Buyer
Indemnitee. The amount of any "Tax benefit" recognized by a Buyer Indemnitee
with respect to each Tax year shall be the amount of the relevant deduction,
expense, loss, or similar Tax item that accrues to a Buyer Indemnitee for the
applicable Tax year multiplied by the effective tax rate of the Buyer
Indemnitee for such Tax year. Notwithstanding anything in this Article VI,
neither a Buyer Indemnitee nor its successors or assigns shall have any right
or entitlement to indemnification for any Losses or Taxes to the extent that
such Buyer Indemnitee or its successors and assigns had already recovered for
the Losses or Taxes with respect to the same matter pursuant to any other
provision of this Agreement, and such Buyer Indemnitee shall be deemed to
have waived and released any claims for such Losses or Taxes and shall not be
entitled to assert any such claim for indemnification for such Losses or
Taxes. Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for any Taxes of any of the Acquired
Companies or relating to the Business or any of the Assets that are the
responsibility of Sellers pursuant to this Section 6.03 within ten Business
Days after payment of such Taxes by Buyer or the Acquired Companies.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 6.04 Straddle Period. Sellers and Buyer will, to the extent
permitted by applicable law elect with the relevant taxing authority to close
the taxable year of each Acquired Company on the Closing Date. For all
purposes of this Agreement, in the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing
Date (each such period, a "Straddle Period"), the portion of any such Taxes
that are treated as Pre-Closing Taxes shall be:

 

 

(a) in the case of Taxes based upon, or related to, income or receipts,
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended
on the Closing Date; and

 

 

(b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire period.

 

 

The portion of any such Taxes that are not treated as Pre-Closing Taxes
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be treated as Post-Closing Taxes for
all purposes of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 6.05 Section 338 Election. No party hereto shall make any election
under Section 338 of the Code (or any corresponding election under state,
local or foreign Law).

 

 

Section 6.06 Contests.

 

 

(a) Upon receipt by Buyer, any Acquired Company or any Affiliate thereof of a
written notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits, examinations,
protest proceedings, assessments or claims that could give rise to a claim
for indemnity under Section 6.03 (an "Indemnifiable Tax Liability"), Buyer
shall promptly give written notice thereof to Parent (the "Tax
Claim Notice").

 

 

(b) Subject to Section 6.06(c), Sellers may elect to control, through their
Representatives, and at their expense, the compromise or contest, either
administratively or in the courts, of any Indemnifiable Tax Liability. If
Sellers elect to so represent the interests of an Acquired Company or Buyer,
they shall within thirty (30) Business Days of delivery of any Tax Claim
Notice (or reasonably sooner, if the nature of the Indemnifiable Tax
Liability so requires) notify Buyer of their intent to do so, and Buyer shall
cooperate, at the sole expense of Sellers, in the defense against, or
compromise or settlement of, any claim in any such proceeding. In that event,
Sellers shall reasonably and in good faith consult with Buyer with respect to
each aspect of the defense against, or compromise or settlement of, any such
Indemnifiable Tax Liability. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Buyer shall be permitted, at its expense, to be represented at
each conference, hearing or meeting with representatives of the pertinent
taxing authority (and shall be notified reasonably in advance thereof).
Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer in writing after it settles, compromises
or abandons any claim of matters related to Indemnifiable Tax Liability, and
with respect to any such claim that could adversely affect an Acquired
Company, Buyer or any of their respective affiliates with respect to any
Post-Closing Tax Period, Sellers shall not settle, compromise or abandon any
matter related to Indemnifiable Tax Liability without obtaining the prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed. If Sellers elect not to represent the
interests of an Acquired Company, Buyer may pay, compromise or contest such
Indemnifiable Tax Liability in any reasonable manner it deems appropriate (in
its sole discretion), and Sellers shall remain fully liable for such
Indemnifiable Tax Liability.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Buyer shall control, at its own expense, any Tax proceeding for a
Straddle Period with respect to any Acquired Company; provided, however, that
(i) Buyer shall consult with Sellers before taking any significant action in
connection with such Tax proceeding, and (ii) Buyer shall not settle,
compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior
written consent of the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

 

Section 6.07 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. Sellers and Buyer
shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of
them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return pursuant to
this Article VI or in connection with any audit or other proceeding in
respect of Taxes of the Acquired Companies. Such cooperation and information
shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof,
together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by tax authorities. Each of
Sellers and Buyer shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers,
records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the
Acquired Companies for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to
which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to
extensions except to the extent notified by the other party in writing of
such extensions for the respective Tax periods. Prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records
and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Acquired
Companies for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date, Sellers
or Buyer (as the case may be) shall provide the other party with reasonable
written notice and offer the other party the opportunity to take custody of
such materials.

 

 

Section 6.08 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any indemnification
payments pursuant to this Article VI shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
Law.

 

 

Section 6.09 Survival. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the provisions of Section 3.22 and this Article VI shall survive
until 90 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
for the assessment or collection of Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period.

 

 

Section 6.10 Overlap. To the extent that any obligation or responsibility
pursuant to Article VIII may overlap with an obligation or responsibility
pursuant to this Article VI, the provisions of this Article VI shall govern.

 

 

Section 6.11 NJ Tax Matter. Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.06 to
the contrary, Sellers shall control the contest or resolution of the NJ Tax
Matter; provided, however, that if there is a proceeding with respect to the
NJ Tax Matter that is reasonably likely to adversely affect an Acquired
Company, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to any
Post-Closing Tax Period (other than a Post-Closing Tax Period that is part of
a Straddle Period), then Buyer shall be permitted, at its expense, to consult
with Seller in connection with such proceedings (and shall be notified
reasonably in advance thereof). Without limiting in any way the other
obligations of Buyer pursuant to this Article VI, with respect to the NJ Tax
Matter, the parties agree that, to the extent reasonably requested by
Sellers, Buyer shall (and shall cause the Acquired Companies to) provide
Sellers and their respective employees, agents, officers and representatives,
promptly upon request, access to the books and records of the Acquired
Companies related to the NJ Tax Matter or other information reasonably
necessary to the defense thereof.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 6.12 Refunds. Any refunds of Taxes relating to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods actually paid or indemnified by any of Sellers pursuant to this
Article VI shall be for the account of the applicable Seller; provided,
however, that any refunds resulting from the carryback of post-Closing losses
and similar items shall be for the account of Buyer. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 6.12, Buyer shall not carry back any post-
Closing losses to any Tax Return of a Tax Consolidated Company for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period. Buyer agrees to assign and remit promptly and to cause
the Acquired Companies to assign and remit promptly to such Seller all
refunds of Taxes which such Seller is entitled to under this Section 6.12 and
which are received by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer.

 

 

Section 6.13 Allocation. All amounts constituting consideration for the
assets and rights of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall
be allocated among the acquired assets using the residual method as described
in Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and using
values determined primarily based on the revenue generated by the respective
assets. Within sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide Parent with a proposed schedule (the "Allocation Schedule")
allocating all such amounts as provided herein. The Allocation Schedule shall
become final and binding on the parties hereto fifteen (15) calendar days
after Buyer provides such schedule to the Parent, unless the Parent objects
in writing to Buyer, specifying the basis for the objections of Parent and
preparing an alternative allocation. If Parent does object, Parent and Buyer
shall in good faith attempt to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15)
calendar days of written notice to Buyer of Parent's objection. Any such
resolution shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. Any unresolved
disputes shall be promptly submitted to the Accounting Referee for
determination, with such determination being final and binding on the parties
hereto. Parent on the one hand and Buyer on the other hand will each pay one-
half of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee. Parent and Buyer
shall cooperate with each other and the Accounting Referee in connection with
the matters contemplated by this Section 6.13, including, without limitation,
by furnishing such information and access to books, records (including,
without limitation, accountants work papers), personnel and properties as may
be reasonably requested. Each of the parties hereto agrees to (a) prepare
and timely file all Tax Returns, including, without limitation, Form 8594
(and all supplements thereto) in a manner consistent with the Allocation
Schedule as finalized and (b) act in accordance with the Allocation Schedule
for all Tax purposes. The parties hereto will revise the Allocation Schedule
to the extent necessary to reflect any post-Closing payment made pursuant to
or in connection with this Agreement. In the case of any payment referred to
in the preceding sentence, Buyer shall propose a revised Allocation
Schedule, and the parties hereto shall follow the procedures outlined above
with respect to review, dispute and resolution in respect of such revision.

Exclusions) for which the Seller Indemnitees have received indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.03(a) has exceeded $5,000,000.

 

 

(e) Solely for purposes of determining the cost of Losses that an
Indemnifying Party is obligated to pay or reimburse an Indemnified Party for
pursuant to this Article VIII and not for purposes of determining whether an
inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty has occurred for
which an Indemnifying Party has an indemnification obligation pursuant to
this Article VIII, the Loss incurred from such inaccuracy or breach shall be
determined without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or
other similar qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such
representation or warranty.

 

 

(f) No party shall be entitled to indemnification for any Loss that was the
subject of the Working Capital calculation set forth in Section 2.03.
The amount of any Losses payable under Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 by
the Indemnifying Party shall be: (i) net of any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible therefor; (ii) reduced by an amount equal to
any Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party arising from or related to
the incurrence or payment of such Losses; and (iii) increased by any Tax
detriment associated with the receipt, or right to receive indemnification
hereunder; and to the extent the Indemnified Party recognizes a Tax benefit
in a year after the receipt of the indemnification payment pursuant to this
Section 8.04(f), the Indemnified Party shall pay the amount of such Tax
benefit to the Indemnifying Party as such Tax benefits are recognized by the
Indemnified Party. The amount of any "Tax benefit" recognized by an
Indemnified Party with respect to each Tax year shall be the amount of the
relevant deduction, expense, loss, or similar Tax item that accrues to an
Indemnified Party for the applicable Tax year multiplied by the effective tax
rate of the Indemnified Party for such Tax year. If the Indemnified
Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance polices, or from any
other Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses in respect of such
Losses subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party,
then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party
for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount
received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in collecting such amount. Notwithstanding anything in this
Article VIII, no Indemnified Party or its successors or assigns shall have
any right or entitlement to indemnification from an Indemnifying Party for
any Losses to the extent that such Indemnified Party or its successors and
assigns had already recovered for the Losses with respect to the same matter
pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement, and such Indemnified
Parties shall be deemed to have waived and released any claims for such
Losses and shall not be entitled to assert any such claim for indemnification
for such Losses.

Section 8.05 Indemnification Procedures. The party making a claim under this
Article VIII is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party
against whom such claims are asserted under this Article VIII is referred to
as the "Indemnifying Party".

 

 

(a) Third Party Claims. If, prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival period set forth in Section 8.01, any Indemnified Party receives
notice of the assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any
Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to
this Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim")
against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnified Party is
seeking indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event not later than 30 calendar days after receipt of such notice of
such Third Party Claim (it being understood that any notice of the assertion
or commencement of a Third Party Claim delivered by an Indemnified Party to
an Indemnifying Party after the expiration of the applicable survival period
set forth in Section 8.01 shall be barred from indemnity under this
Agreement). The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party receives notice of
the Third Party Claim after the expiration of the applicable survival period
set forth in Section 8.01 or the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or
defenses or is otherwise materially prejudiced by reason of such failure, and
the Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligation with respect to any Third
Party Claim for which the Indemnifying Party is not so relieved shall survive
until the final resolution of such Third Party Claim. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that
has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the
Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying Party's own counsel that
is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; provided, that if the
Indemnifying Party is any Seller, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to defend or direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim that
seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party.
In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
Third Party Claim, subject to Section 8.05(b), it shall have the right to
take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or
make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and
on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel
selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control the
defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party, provided, that if in the reasonable opinion
of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available
to an Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict
of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that
cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Parties shall be liable for the reasonable
fees and expenses of one counsel to all Indemnified Parties in respect of
each Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder in each
jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines counsel is required.
If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party
Claim, fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its
election to defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails to diligently
prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may,
subject to Section 8.05(b), pay, compromise, defend such Third Party Claim
and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or
relating to such Third Party Claim. Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with
each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any
Third Party Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions of
Section 5.01) records relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing,
without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses)
to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as
may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third
Party Claim.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Settlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
except as provided in this Section 8.05(b). If a firm offer is made to
settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from all Liabilities and obligations in connection with
such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree
to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to
that effect to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to
consent to such firm offer within ten days after its receipt of such notice,
the Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third Party
Claim and in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as
to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement
offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also
fails to assume defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may
settle the Third Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to
settle such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the
defense pursuant to Section 8.05(a), it shall not agree to any settlement
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

 

(c) Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party within the applicable survival period set
forth in Section 8.01 by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt
written notice thereof, but in any event not later than 30 days after the
Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim (it being understood
that no Indemnified Party shall be indemnified under this Agreement for any
Loss incurred after the expiration of the applicable survival period set
forth in Section 8.01). The failure to give such prompt written notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
receives notice after the expiration of the applicable survival period set
forth in Section 8.01 of the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses
or is otherwise materially prejudiced by reason of such failure and any
indemnification obligations for which the Indemnifying Party is not so
relieved shall survive until the final resolution thereof. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall
include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate
the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or
may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have
30 days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct
Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its
professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to
give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is
payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist
the Indemnifying Party's investigation by giving such information and
assistance (including access to the Acquired Companies' premises and
personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or
records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors
may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within
such 30 day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected
such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and
subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Tax Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
control of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding in respect of Taxes of
the Acquired Companies (including any such claim in respect of a breach of
the representations and warranties in Section 3.22 or any breach or violation
of or failure to fully perform any covenant, agreement, undertaking
or obligation in Article VI) shall be governed exclusively by Article
VI hereof.

 

 

Section 8.06 Payments. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or
finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article VIII, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within 15 Business Days of
such final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately
available funds. The parties hereto agree that should an Indemnifying Party
not make full payment of any such obligations within such 15 Business Day
period, any amount payable shall accrue interest from and including the date
of agreement of the Indemnifying Party or final, non-appealable adjudication
to and including the date such payment has been made at a rate per annum
equal to 6%. Such interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of a
365 day year and the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding.

 

 

Section 8.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

 

 

Section 8.08 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 5.02 and Section 9.11 and
the last sentence of Section 3.11, the parties acknowledge and agree that
their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other
than claims arising from fraud or intentional misrepresentation on the part
of a party hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in Article VI and this Article VIII. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under
Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action for any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth
herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it may
have against the other parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of their
respective Representatives arising under or based upon any Law, except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in Article VI and this
Article VIII. Nothing in this Section 8.08 shall limit any Person's right to
seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled or
to seek any remedy on account of any Person's fraud or intentional
misrepresentation.

costs and expenses, including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of
counsel, financial advisors and accountants, incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the Closing shall have
occurred; provided, however, Buyer shall be solely responsible for all filing
and other similar fees payable in connection with any filings or submissions
under the HSR Act, if applicable.

herein.

 

 

Section 9.04 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only
and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 9.05 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision
of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or
