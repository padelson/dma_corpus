\- iv - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (this " _Agreement_ "),
dated as of November 21, 2016, is by and among Applied Micro Circuits
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), MACOM Technology
Solutions Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Montana

of Parent (" _Purchaser_ ") and Montana Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub
Two_ " and, together with Purchaser, the " _Merger Subs_ "). Parent,
Purchaser and the Company are each sometimes referred to herein as a "Party"
and collectively as the "Parties."

 

WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, it is proposed that Purchaser shall commence an exchange offer (the
" _Offer_ ") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock, $0.01
par value per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") and
the corporate goodwill associated with such Company Common Stock for the
consideration and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

 

WHEREAS, it is also proposed that (a) the Parties shall effect the acquisition
of the Company by Parent through the merger of Purchaser with and into the
Company, with the Company surviving the merger (the " _First Merger_ ") in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the "DGCL") and (b) immediately following the First Merger, the merger of the
Company, as the surviving company of the First Merger, with and into Merger
Sub Two, with Merger Sub Two surviving the merger (the " _Second Merger_ "
and, together with the First Merger, the " _Mergers_ ");

WHEREAS, in connection with the First Merger, each outstanding share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) will automatically be
converted into the right to receive the Transaction Consideration upon the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
DGCL;

WHEREAS, the Parties intend that the Offer and the Mergers, taken together,
will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and that this
Agreement be, and is hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-2(g);

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") has: (i) determined that the Offer and the First Merger are fair
to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders; (ii)
adopted and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Mergers (the " _Transactions_
"); (iii) resolved that the First Merger shall be effected as soon as
practicable following the Acceptance Time without a vote of the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL; and (iv) subject to the
terms hereof, resolved and agreed to  recommend that holders of shares of Company Common Stock accept the Offer
and tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (such
recommendation, the " _Company Recommendation_ ");

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board of Directors_
") and each of the Merger Subs has (a) determined that the Mergers are
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent, each of the
Merger Subs and its respective stockholders or members, as applicable,
respectively, and (b) approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement
and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Mergers;

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to ParentÂ’s willingness to enter into
this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have simultaneously
herewith entered into that certain Support Agreement (the " _Support
Agreement_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements specified herein in connection with
the Transactions.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and provided that this Agreement has not been
terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE VIII_ and that the Company shall have
complied with its obligations under _Section 1.2_ and _Section 1.3_ hereof, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but in any event within
twenty (20) Business Days of the date hereof), Purchaser shall, and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to, commence the Offer within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together
with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_
"). The obligations of Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to,
accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer are subject only to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ (the "
_Offer Conditions_ "). In the Offer, each share of Company Common Stock
accepted by Purchaser shall be exchanged for the right to receive: (i) $3.25
in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), and (ii) 0.1089 shares of Parent
Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ ", and together with the Cash
Consideration, the " _Transaction Consideration_ ").

(b) _Changes to Terms and Conditions_. Purchaser expressly reserves the
right to waive any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer, except
that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not,
and Parent shall not permit Purchaser to, (i) reduce the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Transaction
Consideration to be paid in the Offer, (iii) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, (iv) waive, amend or modify any of the conditions set
forth in paragraphs (A), (B),

 



\- 2 -  (C) or (D) of _Annex A_ , (v) add any condition to the Offer other than
those set forth in _Annex A_ , (vi) amend, modify or supplement any Offer
Condition in any manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock, (vii)
except as otherwise expressly required or permitted under this Agreement,
terminate or extend the Offer, or (viii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement
any of the terms of the Offer in any manner adverse (other than in an
immaterial or de minimis way) to the holders of Company Common Stock.

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at 12:00 a.m. midnight, Eastern time, on
the date that is twenty (20) business days (for this purpose calculated in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the
date the Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act) (such initial expiration date, or such
subsequent time and date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_
").

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE VIII_ , (A) Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Expiration Date for any period
required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")
and its staff with respect thereto or the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq
Global Select Market (" _Nasdaq_ "), applicable to the Offer, including such
time as is necessary pursuant to  _Section 1.2(c)_ (but in no event shall
Purchaser be required to extend the Offer for this purpose past the End Date),
and (B) if at any scheduled Expiration Date the Offer Conditions shall not
have been satisfied or earlier waived, Purchaser may elect to, and if
requested by the Company, shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to), extend
the Offer and the Expiration Date to a date that is not more than ten (10)
business days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after such previously
scheduled Expiration Date; _provided_ , _howeve_ r, that Purchaser shall not
be required to extend the Offer pursuant to this clause (ii) on more than two
(2) occasions if all Offer Conditions other than the Minimum Condition are
satisfied on the date on which the Offer is scheduled to expire, but the
Minimum Condition is not satisfied, but may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, elect to do so; provided, further, that (x) notwithstanding the
foregoing in this clause (ii), in no event shall Purchaser be required to
extend the Offer beyond the End Date, if Purchaser is then entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ and (y) in no event
shall Purchaser be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the End Date (unless
the Company has consented to such extension).

 

(d) _Payment for Shares of Company Common Stock_. Subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver by Purchaser of the Offer Conditions as of the
Expiration Date, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, (i)
promptly after the Expiration Date irrevocably accept for payment (the time of
such acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ "), and (ii) promptly (within the
meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act, and in any
event within three (3) business days (calculated as set forth in Rule
14d-1(g)(3))) after the Expiration Date pay for, all shares of Company
Common Stock that are validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn) in the
Offer. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide
or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds and shares of
Parent Common 

 



\- 3 -  Stock necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that Purchaser
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
1.1(d)_ without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not
accept for payment or pay for any shares of Company Common Stock if, as a
result, Purchaser would acquire less than the number of shares of Company
Common Stock necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to register (and shall instruct its transfer agent
to register) the transfer of shares of Company Common Stock accepted for
payment effective immediately after the Acceptance Time.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. In lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock that otherwise would be issuable pursuant to the Offer, each
holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer
(after aggregating all shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer
(and not validly withdrawn) by such holder) will be paid an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common
Stock _multiplied by_  the Parent Trading Price, rounded to the nearest one-
hundredth of a cent.

(f) _Adjustments to the Offer_. The Cash Consideration and the Stock
Consideration shall each be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock, as applicable), reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change (other than in connection with the Transactions)
with respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock or shares of
Parent Common Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to PurchaserÂ’s
acceptance for payment of, and payment for, shares of Company Common Stock
that are tendered pursuant to the Offer.

 

(g) _Termination_. Nothing in this _Section 1.1_ shall be deemed to
impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Parties to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _ARTICLE VIII_. In the event
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_ prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date, Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours of such termination of this Agreement) irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer.

 

Section 1.2. _Schedule TO; Offer Documents; Registration Statement_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is first commenced (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), but in any
event within twenty (20) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall, and shall cause Purchaser to:

Company Common Stock represented by book-entry form (" _B_ _ook_ _-_ _Ent_ _r_

prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a " _C_ _er_ _ti_ _f_ _i_ _ca_ _t_ _e_ ") shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Transaction Consideration upon the
surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with _Section
3.2_ , including the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_ , cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, into which
such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to this
_Section 3.1(a)_ , together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to
_Section 3.2(e)_.

converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the First Surviving Company and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the First Surviving Company. From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Purchaser
Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number
of shares of common stock of the First Surviving Company into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(b) _Share Adjustments_. At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the
Second Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parties or

membership interest of the Surviving Company and (ii) all shares of common
stock of the First Surviving Company shall no longer be outstanding and shall

of shares of Company Common Stock to require appraisal of their shares (the "
_Appraisal Provisions_ ") of Company Common Stock (" _Dissenting Shares_ "),

into the right to receive the Transaction Consideration, but shall become the
right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such

\- 11 -  Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder, after the Effective
Time, withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise
loses its right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, each of such
Dissenting StockholderÂ’s shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be
treated as though such shares of Company Common Stock had been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Transaction Consideration.

notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock received
by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent the opportunity to

shares, or any similar event shall have occurred (other than in connection
with the Transactions), then the Transaction Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change; provided
that nothing in this _Section 3.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the Company
to take any of the foregoing actions with respect to its securities to the
extent otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Offer or
the Merger, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be delivered upon the conversion of Company Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ , and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder
of shares of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to
the First Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented
by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, cash (without interest)
in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Trading Price, rounded
to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent by (ii) the fraction of a share (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at
the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed
in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise
be entitled (the " _F_ _r_ _ac_ _tion_ _a_ _l_ _S_ _h_ _ar_ _e_ _ _ _C_ _a_

\- 13 -  evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_ , each Certificate and Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Transaction Consideration
into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with the Fractional
Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section
3.2(e)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or
an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the
Exchanged Amounts that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_ARTICLE III_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-
Entry Shares whose Company Common Stock were converted into the right to
receive the Exchanged Amounts shall upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of an
"agentÂ’s message" in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to exchange and deliver as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchanged Amounts in
respect of each such share of Company Common Stock, and the Book-Entry Shares
of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled.

record date after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock,
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered share of Company Common Stock
to be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section
3.1(a)(i)_ until such holder shall surrender such share in accordance with
this  _Section 3.2_. After the surrender in accordance with this _Section
3.2_ of a share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ , the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (in addition to the Transaction
Consideration and the Fractional Share Cash Amount payable to such holder
pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_ ) any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to the Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of such share of

_ARTICLE III_ upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock, once so
delivered and paid, shall be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock
(subject to any rights of Dissenting Stockholders). From and after the
Effective Time, subject to ParentÂ’s and PurchaserÂ’s compliance with their
respective obligations hereunder, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company
other than the right to receive the Transaction Consideration into which the
shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section 3.2(d)_ (together with the
Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with 
_Section 3.2(e)_ ), without interest, and (ii) the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock

registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company
of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to

or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are
presented to the Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE III_ , subject to applicable Law in the
case of Dissenting Shares.

 

(g) _Sale of Excess Shares_. As promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued and delivered
representing the Transaction Consideration over (B) the aggregate number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to former holders of
Company Common Stock in the Offer or pursuant to _Section 3.2_ (determined
before taking into account any shares of Parent Common Stock withheld under

the Company, sell the Parent Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on
Nasdaq, all in the manner provided in this _Section 3.2(g)_. The sale of the
Parent Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on Nasdaq through
one or more member firms of Nasdaq and shall be executed in round lots to the
extent practicable. The Exchange Agent shall use reasonable best efforts to
complete the sale of the Parent Excess Shares as promptly following the
Effective Time as is practicable, consistent with obtaining the best execution
of such sales in light of prevailing market conditions. Until the net proceeds
of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares formerly representing Company Common Stock, the Exchange
Agent shall hold such proceeds in the Exchange Fund.

recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. No such investment
or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_ , and following any losses
from any such investment, or to the extent the cash portion of the Exchange
Fund otherwise diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Exchange Agent to make cash payments pursuant to _Section 3.1_ , Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the
amount of such losses or other shortfall, which additional funds will be
deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and
any cash amounts in excess of the amounts payable under _Section 3.1_ , shall

otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
for 180 days

 



\- 15 -  after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied
with this _ARTICLE III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving
Company (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as
general creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Transaction
Consideration and any dividends and distributions which such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_ without any interest thereon.

a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any
portion of the Transaction Consideration or the cash to be paid in accordance
with this _ARTICLE III_ that remains undistributed to the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of the second (2nd) anniversary of the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the
Transaction Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

Transaction Consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement and any other agreement or arrangements entered into in
connection with the Offer or the Merger, such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld with respect to the foregoing under any applicable Tax
Law. Any amounts so deducted or withheld shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement (and any other agreement or arrangements entered into in
connection with the Offer or the Merger) as having been paid to the person in
respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. Any compensatory
payments contemplated to be made hereunder shall be made through the payroll
procedures of the applicable person.

the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount
as Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably require as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Company with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of
the Exchange Fund and subject to _Section 3.2(h)_ , Parent) shall deliver, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Transaction
Consideration and any dividends and distributions deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate been surrendered.

 

Section 3.3. _Company Options_ _, Company RSUS and ESPP_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Vested In-the-Money Company Options_. Each Company
Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and has a per-share exercise price in excess of the sum of the
Cash Consideration plus the product of the

 



\- 16 -  Stock Consideration multiplied by the closing price of the Parent Common
Stock on Nasdaq on the last trading day immediately prior to the Effective
Time, to the extent vested in accordance with its terms as of the Effective
Time (each, a " _Vested In-the-Money Company Option_ ") shall be cancelled as
of the Effective Time and thereafter shall only entitle the holder of such
Company Option to receive (without interest) an amount in cash and a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Option Consideration_ ") equal to the
product of the (i) Transaction Consideration (with the Stock Consideration
value based on the closing price of the Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq on the
last trading day immediately before the Effective Time), multiplied by (ii)
that number of whole and partial (computed to the nearest four decimal places)
shares of Company Common Stock equal to the excess of (A) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock then subject to such Vested In-the-Money
Company Option over (B) the number of whole and partial (computed to the
nearest four decimal places) shares of Company Common Stock that, when
multiplied by the closing price of the Company Common Stock on Nasdaq on the
last trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time, is equal to the
aggregate exercise price of such Vested In-the-Money Company Option.

 

(b) _Treatment of Unvested and Out-of-the-Money Company Options_. Each
Company Option other than a Vested In-the-Money Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted
into, as of the Effective Time, and thereafter evidence an award of stock
options exercisable for Parent Common Stock (after such conversion, "
_Rollover Options_ ") with respect to that number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to (i) the number of whole shares of Company Common
Stock underlying the Company Option from which it was converted immediately
prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) a fraction (computed to the
nearest four decimal places) the numerator of which is the fair market value
of one share of Company Common Stock and the denominator of which is the fair
market value of one share of Parent Common Stock (with the fair market value
of Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock determined based on their
respective closing prices on Nasdaq on the last trading day immediately prior
to the Effective Time). Each Rollover Option shall have an exercise price per
share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to
(1)(A) the per share exercise price for the corresponding Company Option,
divided by (B) the fair market value of one share of Company Common Stock,
which quotient shall be multiplied by (2) the fair market value of one share
of Parent Common Stock (with the fair market value of Company Common Stock
and Parent Common Stock determined based on their respective closing prices
on Nasdaq on the last trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time),
and shall be subject to the same vesting terms and conditions as had been
applied to the corresponding Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The foregoing will be subject to such modifications, if any,
as are required to cause the conversion contemplated by this _Section 3.3(b)_
to be made in a manner consistent with exemption from Section 409A of the
Code and, to the extent applicable, Section 424 of the Code, or as are
otherwise reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable.

 

(c) _Treatment of Vested Company RSUs and MSUs_. Each Company RSU and
Company MSU that is outstanding as of the Effective Time, to the extent
vested in accordance with its terms as of the Effective Time (each, a "
_Vested Company RSU_ ") shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective
Time and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, be settled in
that number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying the Vested

 



\- 17 -  Company RSU as of the Effective Time and thereafter shall entitle the holder
of such Vested Company RSU to receive (without interest) an amount in cash and
a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Transaction
Consideration (with the Stock Consideration valued based on the closing price
of the Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq on the last trading day immediately
before the Effective Time), in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
that was subject to such holderÂ’s Vested Company RSUs (the " _RSU
Consideration_ ").

 

(d) _Treatment of Unvested Company RSUs_. Each Company RSU and Company MSU
that is outstanding as of the Effective Time and is not a Vested Company RSU
(each, an " _Unvested Company RSU_ "), shall be cancelled as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and converted into, as of the Effective Time, and
thereafter evidence (i) a restricted stock unit award with respect to the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock that is equal to the product of (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company
RSU as of the Effective Time (for the avoidance of doubt, for Company MSUs,
only that number of shares that become eligible to vest or be accelerated
after the Effective Time under the applicable award agreement or the CompanyÂ’s
Executive Severance Benefit Plan based on actual or deemed performance, as
applicable), multiplied by (B) a fraction the numerator of which is the fair
market value of one share of Company Common Stock and the denominator of which
is the fair market value of one share of Parent Common Stock (with the
fair market value of Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock determined
based on their respective closing prices on Nasdaq on the last trading day
immediately prior to the Effective Time) (after such conversion, " _Rollover
RSUs_ "). Each Rollover RSU shall be subject to the same vesting terms and
conditions as had been applied to the corresponding Company RSU or Company MSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for such terms rendered
inoperative by reason of the Transactions (including, to the extent such
Company MSU vests in accordance with its terms as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time or is deemed to vest under the CompanyÂ’s Executive Severance
Benefit Plan, as applicable, the elimination of all Company Common Stock
price vesting criteria that applied to the Company MSUs prior to the Effective
Time) subject to such adjustments as are reasonably determined by Parent to be
necessary or desirable to give effect to such conversion and the
Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, each Company MSU (or portion
thereof) shall terminate without consideration immediately prior to the
Effective Time to the extent that the applicable performance criteria have not
been satisfied (or deemed satisfied under the CompanyÂ’s Executive Severance
Benefit Plan) as of the Effective Time.

 

(e) _Settlement_. All Option Consideration and RSU Consideration shall be
issued or paid as soon as reasonably practicable, and no later than seven (7)
Business Days, after the Closing Date, subject to compliance with Section 409A
of the Code to the extent applicable. All Option Consideration and RSU
Consideration shall be paid in cash and Parent Common Stock in the same
proportion as is payable to shareholders generally in connection with the
Transactions (subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code); provided,
that Parent may, in its sole discretion, pay the Option Consideration and/or
RSU Consideration wholly in cash or in cash in excess of the amount determined
in accordance with this Section 3.3(e). All Option Consideration and RSU
Consideration shall be payable less Tax withholdings to be applied
against the cash portion of the Option Consideration and/or RSU
Consideration, as applicable. Parent shall register the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Parent Options and Rollover RSUs as promptly
as practicable, and no later than ten (10) Business Days, after the Closing
Date. Parent shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
for so long

 



\- 18 -  as any such Parent Options or Rollover RSUs remain outstanding and shall
reserve a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for issuance upon
exercise or settlement thereof. In lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock that otherwise would be issuable pursuant to Section 3.3(a) or
Section 3.3(c), each individual will be paid an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock,
determined based on the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on
Nasdaq on the last trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time,
rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent. As of the Effective Time, each
Company Option, Company RSU and Company MSU shall cease to exist and shall no
longer be outstanding, and each holder of a Company Option, Company RSU or
Company MSU shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than
the entitlements provided for in the applicable provisions of _Section
3.3(a)_ through _Section 3.3(e)_.

(f) _Treatment of the ESPP_. Prior to the earlier of (i) the Effective
Time and (ii) the commencement of the next regularly scheduled offering period
under the ESPP, the Company shall take all actions necessary or required under
the ESPP and applicable Law to (A) ensure that, except for the six (6)-month
offering period under the ESPP that commenced on August 1, 2016, no offering
period or purchase period shall be authorized or commenced on or after the
date of this Agreement, (B) ensure that no new participant may begin to
participate in the ESPP, (C) provide that the applicable purchase price for
shares of Company Common Stock (as a percentage of the fair market value of
Company Common Stock) shall not be decreased below the levels set forth in
the ESPP as of the date hereof, (D) if the Closing shall occur prior to the
end of the offering period in existence under the ESPP on the date of this
Agreement, cause the rights of participants in the ESPP with respect to any
such offering period (and purchase period thereunder) then underway under the
ESPP to be determined by treating the last Business Day prior to the Effective
Time as the last day of such offering period and purchase period and by making
such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened
offering period and purchase period but otherwise treating such shortened
offering period and purchase period as a fully effective and completed
offering period and purchase period for all purposes under the ESPP, with any
shares of Company Common Stock purchased under the ESPP cancelled at the
Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Transaction
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_ and (E) cause the funds, if any, that
remain in any participantsÂ’ account after any such purchase to be promptly
returned to the participant. The Company shall terminate the ESPP and all
rights thereunder in their entirety effective as of the Effective
Time, contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions (including obtaining any
necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board of Directors
or an applicable committee thereof and providing notice as required by the
ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by
this _Section 3.3(d)_.

 

(g) _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. Prior to the Acceptance Time,
the Company shall take all actions (including obtaining any necessary
determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board of Directors or an
appropriate committee thereof and providing notice as required by the Company
Stock Plans that may be necessary or desirable to effectuate the provisions
of this _Section 3.3_ and terminate all rights under any Company Equity Plan
or under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement providing for
the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock
of the Company, including all Company Options and Company RSUs and Company
MSUs and to terminate the Company

 



\- 19 -  Equity Plans, in each case, effective as of the Effective Time. The Company
shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
any resolutions, notices or other documents necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 3.3_ and shall consider any comments in good
faith.

Time, to its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ personnel, properties, contracts, books and
records and, during such period, each Party shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, without limitation to the preceding obligations, make
available to the other Party all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other Party may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party shall be required to provide access
to or make available to any person any document or information that, in the
reasonable judgment of the disclosing Party, would be detrimental to its
business operations, would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of
third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality or is subject to any attorney-client or work-product
privilege.

 

(b) No investigation by any Party or its representatives shall affect or be
deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of any other
Party set forth in this Agreement.

(c) The Parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them
or their respective officers, directors, employees or representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions shall
be governed in accordance with the confidentiality agreement, dated as of
July 26, 2016 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between the Company and
Parent.

Section 6.3. _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective officers, directors and employees and shall instruct and
cause their respective agents, financial advisors, investment bankers,
attorneys and accountants (such officers, directors, employees,
agents, financial advisors, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants,
collectively, " _Representatives_ "): (i) to immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than
Parent) that are ongoing with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal and (ii)
not to, directly or indirectly through intermediaries,

 



\- 53 -  (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries), or
knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the making or submission of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
other person any information in connection with or for the purpose of
knowingly encouraging or facilitating, a Company Takeover Proposal (other
than, solely in response to an unsolicited inquiry, to refer the
inquiring person to this _Section 6.3_ and to limit its conversation or other
communication exclusively to such referral, or to otherwise comply with its
obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ ), (C) engage in any negotiations
or discussions with, or provide any information or data to, any person (other
than Parent or any of its Affiliates or representatives) relating to any
Company Takeover Proposal, (D) approve, endorse or recommend a Company
Takeover Proposal or any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or
other Contract contemplating a Company Takeover Proposal, or (E) resolve to do
any of the foregoing.

 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, promptly
request any person that has executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure
agreement within the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date of this
Agreement in connection with any actual or potential Company Takeover Proposal
that remains in effect as of the date of this Agreement to return or destroy
all confidential information in the possession of such person or its
Representatives. The Company shall, within twenty-four (24) hours of the date
hereof, terminate access by any third party to any data room (virtual or
actual) containing any of the CompanyÂ’s confidential information. The Company
shall not release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant permission under or fail to enforce, any standstill
provision in any agreement to which the Company is a party; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the
Company may release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant any permission under, or fail to enforce, any such
standstill provision.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company or any of its Representatives receives a bona
fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal from any person that did
not result from the CompanyÂ’s breach of _Section 6.3_ and if the Company
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Company
Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would, or would
reasonably be expected to, be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may,
(i) furnish information (including non-public information) with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the person who has made such Company Takeover
Proposal if the Company receives from such person an executed confidentiality
agreement containing the terms that, taken as a whole, are not less
restrictive to the other party than those contained collectively in the
Confidentiality Agreement, it being understood and agreed that such
confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill provision or
otherwise prohibit the making or amendment of a Company Takeover Proposal
(such confidentiality agreement, an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_
"); _provided_  

 



\- 54 -  that the Company shall concurrently with the delivery to such person make
available to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its
Representatives unless such non-public information has been previously
provided to Parent and (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions
or negotiations with the person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives regarding such Company Takeover Proposal.

(d) The Company shall within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt (and in
any event prior to furnishing non-public information and/or commencing
discussions or negotiations as provided in _Section 6.3(c)_ ) notify Parent in
writing in the event that the Company or any of its Representatives receives
a Company Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the person making the
Company Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and, in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours of any such development), as to the status
of discussions or negotiations relating to such Company Takeover Proposal,
including with respect to any updates or developments regarding the material
terms and conditions of such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees
that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from
providing any information to Parent in accordance with, or otherwise
complying with, this _Section 6.3_.

(e) The Company Board of Directors shall not (i) (A) fail to include the
Company Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or the Offer Prospectus when
disseminated to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, (B) change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify (or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify), in any such case in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Recommendation, (C) publicly make any recommendation in connection
with a tender offer, exchange offer or merger (other than the Offer or the
Mergers) other than a recommendation against such merger or a temporary "stop,
look and listen" communication by the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (it being understood
that the Company Board of Directors may take no position with respect to a
Company Takeover Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer until the
close of business on the tenth (10th) Business Day after the commencement of
such tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act, without such action being considered a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change), or (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of the Company a Company Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) authorize, cause or permit
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement (including an acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement) or agreement in
principle with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
prior to the Acceptance Time, but not after, the Company Board of Directors
(i) may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change other than in response to
a Company Takeover Proposal if, prior to taking such action, the Company Board
of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial adviser and outside legal counsel, that such

 



\- 55 -  action is required to comply with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (ii) may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement, in either such case in response to
a bona fide, unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a
breach of _Section 6.3_ , if prior to taking such action, the Company Board
of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that (i) such Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (ii)
such action would, or would reasonably be expected to be, required to comply
with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, prior to taking such action, (A) the Company has given
Parent at least four (4) Business DaysÂ’ prior written notice of its intention
to take such action, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity
of the person making, any such Company Superior Proposal and has
contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal
or any proposed Company Acquisition Agreements (or, in each case, if not
provided in writing to the Company, a written summary of the material terms
thereof), (B) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives
to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such four (4) Business Day
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to make such revisions to
the terms of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board of Directors
not to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with a
Company Superior Proposal or take any action pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , and
(C) following the end of the four (4) Business DaysÂ’ notice period,
the Company Board of Directors shall have determined, after consultation with
its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and giving due
consideration to the revisions to the terms of this Agreement to which Parent
has irrevocably committed in writing, that the Company Superior Proposal
would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal and that
such action is required to comply with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (it being previously understood and agreed that any change to
the financial or other material terms of a proposal that was previously the
subject of a notice hereunder shall require a new notice to Parent as provided
above), but with respect to any such subsequent notices references herein to
a "four (4) Business Day notice period" shall be deemed references to a "two
(2) Business Day notice period".

 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board of Directors from complying with its disclosure obligations
under United States federal or state Law with regard to a Company Takeover
Proposal, including taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company
(i) a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to
the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law or
obligations of the Company or the Company Board of Directors under applicable
federal securities Law.

Section 6.4. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and until December 31, 2017, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, to employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who are employed as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and who

 



\- 56 -  continue to be employed by Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (the " _Company
Employees_ "), (1) base salaries or wage rates with respect to each Company
Employee that are no less than provided to such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (2) employee benefits (other than equity-based
compensation) and annual cash bonus opportunities that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to (x) employee benefits and annual cash bonus
opportunities provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time or (y) at ParentÂ’s election, to similarly situated employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
and (3) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance
benefits provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time as set forth on  _Section 6.4(a)(1)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule;
it being understood that the Company Employees may commence participation in
ParentÂ’s compensation and benefit plans on different dates following the
Effective Time with respect to different compensation and benefit plans, in
accordance with the terms of the applicable plans. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to,
continue to honor the milestone or other bonus plans and agreements listed on
_Section 6.4(a)(2)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule in accordance with the
terms thereof.

 

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or
maintained by Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries in
the United States in which the Company Employees are eligible to participate
following the Closing Date, other than any equity-based or qualified or non-
qualified defined benefit or deferred compensation plans (collectively, the "
_Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize the service of each Company Employee with
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors prior
to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
under such Post-Closing Plans, in each case, to the same extent such service
was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that such
recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefits of a
Company Employee with respect to the same period of service. Under each Post-
Closing Plan that provides medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision insurance
benefits, for the plan year in which such Company Employee is first eligible
to participate, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (A) cause any
pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such
plan to be waived with respect to each Company Employee to the extent such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan
in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate in
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) credit each Company Employee
for an amount equal to any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee
in the plan year that includes the Effective Time for purposes of any
applicable deductible, coinsurance and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements under any such Post-Closing Plan to the extent such expenses
would have been credited under the terms of the applicable Company Benefit
Plans.

(c) Unless requested by Parent not later than ten (10) days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions
necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior
to the Closing Date, any Company Benefit Plan that contains a cash or deferred
arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a "
_Company_ _401(k)_ _Plan_ "). The Company shall provide to Parent prior to the
Closing

 



\- 57 -  Date written evidence of the adoption by the Company Board of Directors of
resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form
and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). In the event of such 401(k) plan termination, Parent
shall take all actions necessary to allow Company employees who meet the age
and service eligibility requirements under the 401(k) plan maintained by
Parent or its affiliates (the " _Parent_ _401(k)_ _Plan_ ") to enroll as soon
as reasonably practicable following the Closing (and in no event later than
sixty (60) days following the Effective Time) under the Parent 401(k) Plan and
to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within
the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), in the form of cash only. The
Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, cooperate with Parent in
good faith (including by promptly furnishing such information as is requested
by Parent) in fulfilling the obligations of Parent under this
_Section 6.4(c)_.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or
other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of
Parent, the Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere
with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any
of their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge
or terminate the services of any Company Employee or other service provider at
any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall
the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any
Company Benefit Plan, Post-Closing Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the
Surviving Company, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after
the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates; or (ii)
alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan, Post-Closing Plan or any other compensation or benefit or employment
plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this _Section 6.4_ shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any
Company Employee or current or former service provider of the Company or
its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 6.5. _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer and the other
Transactions, including (i) the preparation and filing of all forms,
registrations, applications and notices required to be filed under applicable
Law to consummate the Offer and the Mergers (including the Registration
Statement, the Offer documents, the Schedule 14D-9, and the Offer Prospectus),
(ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to consummating the Offer and the
Mergers, (iii) taking all reasonable actions necessary to obtain
(and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization,
Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity (which
actions shall include furnishing all information and documentary material
required under the HSR Act) required to be obtained or made by Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with the Offer or the Mergers or the taking of any action contemplated by this
Agreement, provided, however, for the avoidance of doubt, that Parent

 



\- 58 -  shall make commercially reasonable efforts to enter into any agreements or
commitments including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divesture or
disposition of such of its assets, properties or businesses or of the assets,
properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant hereto, to the extent
that such agreement, commitment, sale, divesture or disposition would not
individually or together with other agreements, commitments, sales, divestures
or dispositions involve assets owned by either Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that generated revenue in excess of $1,000,000
during the past twelve (12) months ended September 30, 2016, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any reasonable additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Offer and the Mergers and to fully carry out the purposes of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent and the Company each agree to file a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act within ten (10) Business Days of the date of the
Agreement and to make filings required by applicable foreign Antitrust Laws
with respect to the Offer and the Mergers as soon as practicable after the
date of the Agreement (and Parent may "pull and refile" any such form or
filing, if in its reasonable good faith judgment in consultation with and
considering in good faith the views of counsel for the Company, such step is
consistent with expeditiously obtaining a required approval). Additionally,
each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to fulfill all conditions precedent to the Offer and the Mergers and shall not
take any action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining,
any permission, approval or consent from any such Governmental Entity
necessary to be obtained to consummate the Offer and the Mergers, except any
actions taken in relation to the rights of the Company under _Section 6.3_.
Parent and the Company may agree to postpone any filings required under this
_Section 6.5(a)_ based on input from counsel.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to the completion of the Offer and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders or
approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity undertaken
pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 6.5_. In that regard, prior to
the Closing, each Party shall promptly consult with the other Parties to this
Agreement with respect to and provide any reasonable information and
assistance as the other Parties may reasonably request with respect to (and,
in the case of correspondence, provide the other Parties (or their counsel)
copies of) all material notices, submissions, or filings made by such Party
with any Governmental Entity regarding any Antitrust Laws or any other
information supplied by such Party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental
Entity regarding any Antitrust Laws and in connection with this Agreement and
the Offer and the Mergers. Each Party to this Agreement shall promptly inform
the other Parties to this Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other
Parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the
other Parties orally of) any material communication from or to any
Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws and regarding the Offer
and the Mergers, and afford the other Parties a reasonable opportunity to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other Parties in connection with, any proposed communication with any such
Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Parties agree that Parent will, in consultation with the
Company, devise the strategy for all filings, notifications, submissions and
communications in connection with any filing, notice, petition, statement,
registration, submission of information, application or similar filing with a
Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws and subject to this
_Section 6.5_. If any Party 

 



\- 59 -  to this Agreement or any Representative of such Parties receives a request
for additional information or documentary material from any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Offer and the Mergers, then such Party will use
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as promptly as
practicable and after reasonable consultation with the other Parties to this
Agreement, an appropriate response to such request. To the extent permitted
by Law, each Party shall furnish the other Parties with copies of all material
correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Entity with respect
to this Agreement and the Offer and the Mergers, and furnish the other Parties
with such reasonable information and assistance as the other Parties may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or
submissions of information to any such Governmental Entity; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this  _Section 6.5_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by
such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient
unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.5_ ,
materials relating to any Antitrust Laws provided pursuant to this _Section
6.5_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company and the Offer and the Mergers or other confidential information, (ii)
as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as necessary
to address reasonable privilege concerns.

 

(c) The Company and Parent will each request early termination of the
waiting period with respect to the Offer under the HSR Act. The Company and
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as promptly as practicable,
but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, all notifications required under the HSR Act. In the event that
the Parties receive a request for information or documentary material pursuant
to the HSR Act (a " _Second Request_ "), the Parties will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to respond to such Second Request as promptly as
practicable or as otherwise agreed by the Company and Parent, and counsel for
both Parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second
Request review process.

 

Section 6.6. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Law is or may become
applicable to the Offer or the Mergers or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Parties and each of their respective Board
of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions within such
PartyÂ’s control as are permitted and necessary so that such transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on such transactions.

 

Section 6.7. _Public Announcements_ _._ Unless a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change has occurred, the initial press release concerning the
Offer shall be a joint press release and, thereafter, so long as this
Agreement is in effect, the Company will not disseminate any press release or
other announcement concerning the Offer or this Agreement or
the Transactions, except as may be required by Law, without the prior consent
of Parent and Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 



\- 60 -  Notwithstanding the foregoing, without prior consent of the other parties,
each party (a) may communicate information that is not confidential
information of any other party with financial analysts, investors and media
representatives in a manner consistent with its past practice in compliance
with applicable Law or by the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, and (b) may
disseminate the information included in a press release or other document
previously approved for external distribution by the other parties. Each Party
agrees to promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) make
available to the other Parties copies of any written communications made
without prior consultation with the other Parties. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, (i) no Party will be required to consult with the
other Party in connection with any such press release or announcement if the
Company Board of Directors has effected any Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or shall have resolved to do so and (ii) the requirements of this
_Section 6.7_ shall not apply to any disclosure by the Company or Parent of
any information concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in connection with a determination by the Company in accordance with
_Section 6.3_ that an Company Takeover Proposal constitutes, or may
constitute, a Company Superior Proposal or any dispute between the parties
regarding this Agreement, the Offer or the Mergers or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.8. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Purchaser agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification (and all rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto)
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including
any matters arising in connection with the Transactions), now existing in
favor of the Indemnitees as provided in the Company Organizational Documents
or in any Contract between such Indemnitee and the Company listed on _Section
6.8_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (in each case as in effect on the
date of this Agreement) shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full
force and effect. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, and advance expenses to, Indemnitees with respect to (x) all
acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time at or prior
to the Effective Time or (y) any costs or expenses (including attorneysÂ’
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to
the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of
or pertains to the Offer, the Mergers, this Agreement and any transactions
contemplated hereby, in either case, in each of (x) and (y) to the
extent provided in the Company Organizational Documents or in any Contract
between such Indemnitee and the Company listed on _Section 6.8_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement),
and Parent shall guarantee the payment of such amounts to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents of the Surviving Company to contain provisions with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of
director, officer and employee liability that are no less favorable to the
Indemnitees than those set forth in the Company Organizational Documents and
the Contracts listed on _Section 6.8_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule as of
the date of this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any Indemnitees.

 



\- 61 - (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall obtain
(either directly or through one of its Subsidiaries) and fully pay the
premium for a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the Indemnitees than the existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
insurance policies and the CompanyÂ’s existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies (" _D andO Insurance_") with respect to any claim related to any period
of time at or prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that neither
the Surviving Company nor Parent shall be required to pay for such "tail"
prepaid policy more than two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for its DandO Insurance or, if
substantially equivalent or greater insurance coverage is unavailable, the
best available coverage; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving
Company shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance
in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently
paid by the Company for such insurance; provided, further, that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount. In the alternative, the Company may purchase fully-
prepaid, and the Surviving Company shall maintain, for a period of at least
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, DandO Insurance in place as of
the date of this Agreement with the CompanyÂ’s current insurance carrier or a
reputable alternative insurance carrier; provided, however, that the Company
shall not be permitted to pay for such "tail" prepaid policy in excess of two
hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company for such insurance.

 

(c) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.8_ applies shall be express
third-party beneficiaries of this  _Section 6.8_. The provisions of this
_Section 6.8_ shall survive the Effective Time.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this _Section
6.8_ shall survive the consummation of the Mergers indefinitely and shall be
binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Company and its subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the
Indemnitees. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Company or any of its
successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall ensure that proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.8_.

Section 6.9. _Control of Operations_. The Parties understand and
agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other
PartyÂ’s operations (or the operations of the other PartyÂ’s Subsidiaries) prior
to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time, each of the
Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

 



\- 62 - Section 6.10. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Expiration Date, Parent
and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of shares of Parent Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company or will become subject to such reporting requirements with
respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

Section 6.11. _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall, as promptly as
practicable under the circumstances, after it has notice of any of the
following notify the Parent of actions, suits, claims,
governmental investigations or proceedings instituted or threatened against
the Company or any of its directors, officers or affiliates, including by any
stockholder of the Company (by any stockholder and relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, " _Stockholder Litigation_ "),
before any court or Governmental Entity, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting the Company, any of its affiliates, or any of its subsidiaries
which, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
have been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, or seeking damages or discovery in
connection with such transactions. Subject to entry into a customary joint
defense agreement, Parent shall have the right to participate in the defense
of any such actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings, the Company
shall consult with Parent regarding the defense of any such actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings, and the Company may not settle or
compromise any Stockholder Litigation without the prior written consent of
Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, delayed or
denied.

 

Section 6.12. _Nasdaq_ _Matters_ _; SEC Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall file a notification of listing of additional shares (or
such other form as may be required) with Nasdaq with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Offer and the First
Merger and such other shares of Parent Common Stock to be reserved for
issuance in connection with the Offer and the First Merger, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in connection with the Offer and the First Merger and such other shares
of Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance in connection with the
Offer and the First Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Acceptance Time.

 

(b) The Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of Nasdaq
to enable the delisting of the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq and the
termination of its registration under the Exchange Act, in each case, as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (such period between the
Closing Date and the date of which the Company Common Stock is delisted, the "
_Delisting Period_ "), and deregistration of the Company Common Stock under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting. The Company
will not cause the Company Common Stock to be delisted from Nasdaq prior to
the Effective Time. If the Surviving Company is reasonably likely to be
required to file any reports pursuant to the Exchange Act during the
Delisting Period, the

 



\- 63 -  Company will deliver to Parent at least five (5) business days prior to the
Closing a substantially final draft of any such reports reasonably likely to
be required to be filed during the Delisting Period.

(c) The Company shall file prior to the Effective Time all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed or
furnished by it with the SEC prior to such time for the consummation of the
Transactions.

 

Section 6.13. _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Company with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the
Parties to the Mergers, the officers of the Surviving Company shall be
authorized, in the name and on behalf of the Company, to execute and deliver
such deeds, bills of sale, assignment or assurances and take all such other
action as may be necessary in connection therewith.

 

Section 6.14. _Advice of Changes_. The Company and Parent shall each
promptly advise the other Party of (i) any notice or other communication from
any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions or (ii) upon receiving any communication from
any Governmental Entity or third party whose consent or approval is required
for consummation of the Transactions that causes such Party to believe that
there is a reasonable likelihood that any such consent or approval will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any such consent or approval will be
materially delayed.

Section 6.15. _Resignations_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall cause any director and any officer of the Company or each subsidiary of
the Company identified in writing by Parent at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the anticipated Effective Time to execute and deliver a letter
effectuating his or her resignation as a director or officer (but not as an
employee) of such entity effective as of the Effective Time. At the request of
Parent, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent
to effect the replacement of any such directors and officers selected by
Parent at the Effective Time.

Section 6.16. _Third Party Consents_. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts,
to obtain waivers and consents from any and all third parties with respect to
each Contract listed on Section 4.19(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule;
provided, that, in connection with obtaining such waivers and consents, the
Company shall not agree to any change to such Contracts that would be
materially adverse to the interest of the Company, its Subsidiaries or, after
the Closing, Parent, without the prior written consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or denied.

 

Section 6.17. _Certain Tax Matters_. Each of the Parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer and the Mergers, taken together,
to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, including by executing and delivering customary tax representation
letters to the CompanyÂ’s and/or ParentÂ’s counsel, as applicable, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel, in connection with (i) any
tax opinion or description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Offer and the Mergers 

 



\- 64 -  contained or set forth in the Registration Statement and (ii) the tax
opinions referenced in clauses (E)(5)(i) and (E)(5)(ii) of Annex A. Company
and Parent shall cause their respective counsels to use reasonable best
efforts to issue the tax opinions referenced in clauses (E)(5)(i) and
(E)(5)(ii) of Annex A and any opinions related to the tax consequences of the
Offer and Mergers for purposes of the Registration Statement. None of the
Parties shall (and each of the Parties shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries not to) (a) take any action that could reasonably be expected to
cause the Offer and the Mergers, taken together, to fail to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, or to
cause their respective counsel to be unable to deliver the tax opinions
provided for in the preceding sentence, or (b) fail to take any action that
could reasonably be expected to be necessary to cause the Offer and the
Mergers, taken together, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code, or to cause their respective counsel to be able
to deliver the tax opinions provided for in the preceding sentence.

Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose action

failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement and; provided
further, that no termination may be effected as of the End Date during a
thirty (30)-day cure period to which a party is entitled by reason of _Section

cure period);

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if an order by a Governmental Entity
of competent jurisdiction shall have been issued permanently restraining,

the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall not
be available to a Party if such order (or such order becoming final and
nonappealable) was due to the material breach by such Party of any covenant of
such Party set forth in this Agreement, or such PartyÂ’s failure to fulfill a
condition that the Party is obligated to satisfy under this Agreement;

 

(d) by the Company ( _provided_ that the Company is not then in breach of

Agreement and as of the Closing Date, as if made as of such date (except for

earlier date which shall have been true and correct as of such earlier date),
except in the case of this clause (B), where the failure of such other
representations and warranties to be true and correct, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had, or would not be reasonably expected to have, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect; and all relevant breaches, failures to perform or
inaccuracies referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) of this _Section 8.1(d)_ are
not curable or

 



\- 66 -  are not cured within thirty (30) days following written notice from the
Company to Parent describing each such breach or failure in reasonable detail
(it being understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)_ if it shall have materially breached this
Agreement or if such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy by Parent is
cured within such thirty (30)-day period);

 

(e) by the Company, prior to the Acceptance Time, to enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal provided

any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein and
such breach results in the failure of any of the Offer Conditions to be
satisfied and the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred), (i) if any of the
CompanyÂ’s representations or warranties shall not be true and correct or if
the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its agreements or
obligations under this Agreement, in each case only if such condition or
failure would result in a failure of a condition set forth in (E)(2) or (E)(3)
of _Annex A_ , and (ii) all relevant breaches, failures to perform or
inaccuracies referred to in clause (i) of this _Section 8.1(f)_ are
not curable or are not cured within thirty (30) days following written notice
from Parent to the Company describing each such breach or failure in
reasonable detail (it being understood that Parent may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.1(f)_ if it shall have materially
breached this Agreement or if such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy by
the Company is cured within such thirty (30)-day period); and

 

(g) by Parent if, prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change shall have occurred or (ii) the Company shall have
violated or breached its obligations under _Section 6.3_.

Section 8.2. _Effect of Termination_.

Breach of this Agreement.

to _Section 8.1(e)_ , it shall, concurrently with and as a condition to such
termination, pay or cause to be paid the Termination Fee to Parent in

agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive the Mergers, except for covenants and agreements
which contemplate performance or compliance after the Effective Time or
otherwise expressly by their terms survive the Effective Time.

 

Section 9.2. _Expenses_. Except as set forth in _Section 8.2_ , whether or
not the Offer and the Mergers are consummated, all costs and expenses

action (whether at Law, in contract or in tort or otherwise) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution

Party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate
remedy at law. The Parties further agree that no Party to this Agreement shall
be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section 9.5_ and each Party irrevocably waives any objection to the
imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. In addition,
each of the Parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal suit, action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be
brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the
Parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such suit, action
or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties
hereto hereby

 



\- 69 -  irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any suit, action or proceeding with
respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the above named courts, (ii) any claim that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, each of the Parties hereto hereby consents to the service of
process in accordance with _Section 9.7_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by Law.

Section 9.6. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY

WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH
