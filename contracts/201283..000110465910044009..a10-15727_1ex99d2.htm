 **ARTICLE 6** 
  **COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES**

  



  

 **Section 6.1 _Access_**. Between the Execution Date and the Closing Date,
Seller will give Purchasers and their representatives access, at Purchasers
risk and expense, to the Upstream Assets (and, to the extent Seller is
authorized to do so, to the Midstream Assets) and access to and the right
to copy, at Purchasers expense, the Records in Sellers and the Company
Group Members possession or reasonably available to any of them, for the
purpose of conducting an investigation of the Company Group Members and the
Pipeline JV Companies and their assets, but only to the extent that Seller
may do so without violating applicable Laws or any obligations to any third
party and to the extent that Seller has authority to grant such access
without breaching any restriction binding on Seller. Any requests by a
Purchaser for access to the Upstream Assets or the Midstream Assets shall be
made in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 13.2, and neither
Purchaser nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
agents shall make any requests for such access directly or indirectly to any
director, officer, employee or agent of any Company Group Member except as
provided therein. Such access by Purchasers shall be limited to Sellers, the
Company Group Members or the Pipeline JV Companies normal business hours,
as applicable, and Purchasers investigation shall be conducted in a manner
that minimizes interference with the operations of such Persons. Neither
Purchaser nor their respective representatives shall operate equipment or
conduct any testing or sampling of materials on or with respect to the
Upstream Assets or Midstream Assets prior to Closing. In addition, Purchasers
and their respective representatives shall not have access to employment
records of individual employees of Company Group Members prior to Closing
except on such terms as may be agreed by Seller and Purchasers in order to
protect confidential information and ensure compliance with all applicable
Laws and Sellers policies. All information obtained by

  



        
   

  



  

Purchasers and their respective representatives under this Section shall be
subject to the terms of that certain confidentiality agreement between Seller
and Purchasers dated July 15, 2010 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  

 ** **

  

 **Section 6.2 _Government Reviews_**. Seller and Purchasers shall in a
timely manner (a) make all required filings, prepare all required
applications and conduct negotiations with each Governmental Body as to which
such filings, applications or negotiations are necessary or appropriate in
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) provide
such information as each may reasonably request to make such filings, prepare
such applications and conduct such negotiations. Each Party shall reasonably
cooperate with and use all reasonable efforts to assist the other with
respect to such filings, applications and negotiations. Purchasers shall bear
the cost of all filing or application fees payable to any Governmental Body
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, regardless
of which Party, or Affiliate of a Party, is required to make the payments.

  



  

 **Section 6.3 _Notification of Breaches_**. Until the Closing,

  



  

(a) Each Purchaser shall notify Seller and the other Purchaser promptly after
such Purchaser obtains actual knowledge that any representation or warranty
of Seller contained in this Agreement is untrue in any material respect or
will be untrue in any material respect as of the Closing Date or that any
covenant or agreement to be performed or observed by Seller prior to or on
the Closing Date has not been so performed or observed in any
material respect.

  



  

(b) Seller shall notify each Purchaser promptly after Seller obtains actual
knowledge that any representation or warranty of any Purchaser contained in
this Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any
material respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to
be performed or observed by any Purchaser prior to or on the Closing Date has
not been so performed or observed in any material respect.

  



  

(c) If any of the representations or warranties of either Purchaser or Seller
is untrue or shall become untrue in any material respect between the
Execution Date and the Closing Date, or if any of either Purchasers or
Sellers covenants or agreements to be performed or observed prior to or
on the Closing Date shall not have been so performed or observed in any
material respect, but such breach of representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement (if curable) has been cured by the Closing (or, if the Closing does
not occur, by the date this Agreement is terminated), then such breach shall
be considered not to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 6.4 _Public Announcements_**.

  



  

(a) Neither Seller, Ecopetrol and Talisman nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall issue any public statement or press release concerning this
Agreement or the transaction contemplated without providing the other Parties
not less than twenty-four (24) hours to provide comments on such public
statement or press release. For the

  



        
   

  



  

avoidance of doubt, no public statement or press release shall characterize
the transactions contemplated hereby as an asset sale. The Parties
acknowledge that each of the Parties (or its parent company) intends to issue
a press release concerning this Agreement immediately following the execution
of this Agreement substantially in the form previously provided to and
reviewed by each of the other Parties. The Parties further acknowledge that
a Party may be required to file a copy of this Agreement on public records in
order to comply with applicable securities Laws.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.4(a) or anything to the contrary contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement, Purchasers (or their Affiliates) may, from
time to time, disclose to their respective shareholders and investment
advisors and bankers such confidential information pertaining to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other than confidential
information pertaining to:  (i) reserve numbers and description of

regarding transactions similar to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) employee information; (iii) litigation, claims,
investigations and regulatory proceedings other than regulatory proceedings

such Company Group Members recent practices, (ii) not commit to any new
operation reasonably anticipated by Seller to require future capital
expenditures by the Company Group Members in excess of US$2 million
(US$2,000,000), (iii) not voluntarily terminate, materially amend, execute or
extend any material agreements affecting the Upstream Assets, other than
execution or extension of contracts for the sale or exchange of Hydrocarbons
terminable on notice of ninety (90) Days or less, (iv) maintain insurance
coverage on the Upstream Assets presently furnished by non-affiliated third
Persons in the amounts and of the types presently in force, (v) maintain all

Assets, and make all filings that Seller is required to make under applicable
Law with respect to the Upstream Assets, (vi) not voluntary relinquish any
area covered by any Association Contract, (vii) not transfer, sell,
hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any material Upstream Assets
except for sales or exchanges of Hydrocarbons in the ordinary course of
business and sales and dispositions of obsolete or excess equipment and
excluding the Exclusions, [ **Redaction of indemnification matter** ]
 Further, except as to matters set forth on _Schedule 6.5_ or as otherwise
approved by both Purchasers in writing, from the Execution Date until the
Closing, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to cause each Company Group
Member as a shareholder of a Pipeline JV Company or undivided interest owner
in the Unincorporated JV Assets to act with respect to the relevant Midstream
Assets as though the covenants identified in the first sentence of this
Section 6.5 applied to such Midstream Assets; provided, however,
that Purchasers acknowledge that the Company Group Members are minority
shareholders of the

  



        
   

  



  

Pipeline JV Companies and minority owners of the Unincorporated JV Assets,
and the Pipeline JV Companies and other owners or operators of the
Unincorporated JV Assets may take certain actions with respect to the
Midstream Assets notwithstanding a Company Group Members vote not to take
such actions. Requests for approval of any action restricted by this Section
6.5 shall be delivered to each of the following individuals, each of whom
shall have full authority to grant or deny such requests for approval on
behalf of the Purchaser it represents:

 **Section 6.7 _Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to
Purchase_**.

  



  

(a) Promptly after the date hereof, Seller shall prepare and send (i) notices
to the holders of any required consents to assignment that are applicable to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) notices to
the holders of any applicable preferential rights to purchase or similar
rights in compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting waivers of
such rights. Any preferential purchase right must be exercised subject to
all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the successful Closing of this Agreement pursuant to Article 9.
 Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such consents to
assignment and waivers of preferential rights to purchase or similar
rights (or the exercise thereof) to be obtained and delivered prior to
Closing, provided that Seller shall not be required to make payments or
undertake obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such rights in
order to obtain the required consents and waivers.  Purchasers shall
cooperate with Seller in seeking to obtain such consents to assignment and
waivers of preferential rights.

  



  

(b) For consent requirements that have not been satisfied prior to Closing,
each Purchaser, the Company Group Members and Seller shall continue to
use commercially reasonable efforts after Closing to obtain such consent.

  



        
   

  



  

(c) If any preferential right to purchase that applies to the

shall be decreased by the Allocated Value, if any, for such assets, and the
affected assets shall be deemed not to be assets of such Company Group Member

right, net of any Tax arising in respect of the disposal.

  



  

 **Section 6.8 _Financial and Operating Records_**. Both prior to and for a
period of two years after the Closing, Seller shall provide Purchasers with
reasonable access (upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours)

years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009 and (ii) information
reasonably requested by either Purchaser from Sellers operating and
financial records relating to the Company Group for any fiscal quarter for
the current fiscal year completed prior to the Closing and for the
corresponding quarter in the preceding fiscal year. Seller shall cause
Sellers personnel to reasonably cooperate with Purchasers in providing such
access and to reasonably assist Purchasers in locating such information. The
cost incurred by Seller and its Affiliates in providing the operating and
financial records (including fees of accountants, consultants and outside
counsel) to Purchasers and assisting Purchasers as provided in this Article
shall be borne by Purchasers. Each Purchaser releases Seller from and shall:
(i) be liable to; and (ii) fully protect, defend, indemnify and hold Seller
harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses or damages
(including costs of investigation and attorneys and experts fees and
expenses) relating to, arising out of, or connected with, directly
or indirectly, the furnishing of any such records to Purchasers, or a
Purchasers or its Affiliates use of the information contained in such
records, the inclusion of such operational and financial records in any debt
or equity offering documents or related materials, regardless of cause or of
any negligent acts or omissions (including sole negligence, concurrent
negligence or strict liability), breach of duty (statutory or otherwise),

 **Section 6.9 _Indemnity Regarding Access_**. Purchasers agree to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller, the Company Group Members, Sellers other
Affiliates, the other owners of interests in the Upstream Assets, the
Pipeline JV Companies, and all such Persons directors, officers, employees,
agents and representatives from and against any and all claims, liabilities,
losses, costs and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys
fees), including claims, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses attributable
to personal injury, illness or death, or property damage, arising out of or
relating to access to the Upstream Assets or Midstream Assets and to the
Records and other related information prior to the Closing by Purchasers,
their respective Affiliates, or their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents or representatives **,** if caused in whole or in part
by the negligence (whether sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability,
breach of duty (statutory or otherwise), or other legal fault of any
indemnified Person.

  



  

 **Section 6.10 _Assumption of Obligations_**. By the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at Closing, and without limiting
the indemnification obligations of any Party under Article 11 and Article
12, each Purchaser assumes and agrees to pay, perform

  



        
   

  



  

and discharge those obligations of Seller or any of its Affiliates
specifically set forth and described on _Schedule 6.10_.

shall have no right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to
Seller or any of its Affiliates.

  



  

 **Section 6.13 _Replacement of Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guarantees_**.
_Schedule 6.13_ contains a list of bonds, letters of credit and guarantees
posted by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than Company Group
Members) with Governmental Bodies or co-owners for the benefit of any Company
Group Member. None of such bonds, letters of credit and guarantees, or any
others, posted by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than Company Group
Members) with Governmental Bodies or co-owners for the benefit of any Company
Group Member will be transferred to Purchasers. Promptly following Closing,
Purchasers shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the name of the relevant
Company Group Members, replacements for such bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees, and any other bonds, letters of credit or guarantees required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall cause
the cancellation or return of the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees
posted by Seller and its Affiliates.

  



  

 **Section 6.14 _Further Assurances_**. At and after Closing, Seller and
Purchasers agree to take such further actions and to execute, acknowledge and
deliver all such further documents as are reasonably requested by the other
Parties for carrying out the purposes of this Agreement or of any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

  



         
 

  



  

 **Section 6.15 _Power of Attorney and Declarations of Trust_**.

  



  

(a) In order to secure Purchasers interests under this Agreement, Seller
hereby irrevocably appoints, and will cause Kenilworth to appoint, each
Purchaser to be its attorney from and after Closing pending Purchasers
registration as legal holders of the Shares (at which time the power granted
hereunder will expire and be of no further effect) with power on Sellers and
Kenilworths behalf to execute and deliver all deeds and documents and to do
all acts and things and exercise all rights which such Purchasers would be
entitled to execute, deliver and do and exercise if such Purchasers were
registered as the holders of the Shares with power to sub-delegate this power
and power to appoint a substitute attorney in addition to such Purchaser.
Further, Seller on its own behalf and on behalf of Kenilworth hereby
irrevocably declares and acknowledges that for the period starting from
Closing and ending when both Purchasers are registered as members of the
Company, Seller shall hold the applicable Shares purchased by each Purchaser
on bare trust for the benefit of Purchasers, who shall be the sole beneficial
owners thereof.

  



  

(b) Seller agrees that from Closing for so long as any of the Shares remain
registered in its name or in the name of Kenilworth, it will and will cause
Kenilworth:

  



  

(i) not to exercise any of its rights as a member of the Company or appoint
any other person to exercise such rights;

  



  

(ii) to hold on trust for and pay or deliver to the applicable Purchaser
any distributions or notices, documents or other communications which may
be received after the date of this Agreement by Seller or Kenilworth in
its capacity as a member of the Company from the Company or any third party;
and

  



  

(iii) on request by either Purchaser to ratify the validity of all documents
executed and filings made by such Purchaser as its or Kenilworths attorney
for the purposes in this Section 6.15.

  



  

 **Section 6.16 _Share Transfer from Kenilworth_. **At Closing, Seller shall
cause Kenilworth to transfer all shares owned by it with respect to the share
capital of the Company and any Subsidiaries to one of the Purchasers.

  



  

 **Section 6.17 _Covenant Regarding Exclusions_**. At or prior to the
Closing, Seller is authorized to cause, and shall cause: (a) the Company
Group Members to transfer, assign or otherwise convey the Exclusions to an
entity wholly-owned by the Company (the " _Seller Newco_ "); and (b)
the Company to assign all of the equity interests of Seller Newco to Seller
or an Affiliate of Seller (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Affiliate of Seller that is a Company Group Member).  All costs and expenses
associated directly or indirectly with the assignment, transfer and
conveyance of the Exclusions to Seller Newco (including, in the case of the
Excluded Employees, any bonus, inducement, severance or other payments
associated with terminating their employment with Company Group Members
and/or their re-employment with Seller Newco) will be the sole responsibility
of and borne and paid exclusively by Seller or Seller Newco and, if initially
incurred by any Company Group Members, Seller will promptly pay an amount
equal to the amount of such costs and expenses to the Purchasers.

  



        
   

  



  

 **Section 6.18 _Transition Services Agreement_**. Seller and Purchasers

]

  



  

 **Section 6.21 _Shared Software_.** On or before the expiration or
termination of the period during which services are being provided among the
Parties pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, Seller and Purchasers
agree:

  



  

(a) with respect to licenses governing software used by the Company pursuant
to a license from a third party to which a member of the Company Group is not
a party (the " _Shared Third Party Software_ ") located on Company premises,
to the extent permitted by the relevant license terms, and subject to the
consent of the relevant third party licensor, Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller shall use reasonable commercial efforts to assign to Purchasers or a
member of the Company Group specified by Purchasers the Company-specific
portion or portions of such licenses that can be identified (eg., by licensed
site or location, number of licensed seats, number of licensed concurrent
users, or otherwise ) as used solely and exclusively by or for Company Group;
and

  



        
   

  



  

(b) with respect to software used by the Company that is owned by Seller or
an Affiliate of Seller other than any member of the Company Group (the "
_Shared BP Software_ "), Seller or a Seller Affiliate shall grant
to Purchasers or a member of the Company Group specified by Purchasers
a non-exclusive, paid up right and license to access and use such Shared
BP Software (including source code) solely in connection with the business
and operation of Company , provided however, that no license shall be granted
under this Section 6.21(b) to selected items of Shared BP Software for which
Seller or a Seller Affiliate determines in its sole discretion and in good
faith that such software provides significant competitive advantage to
retained businesses or operations of Seller or any Seller Affiliate; and

  



  

(c) with respect to any software owned by a member of the Company Group that
is also used by or on behalf of Seller or an Affiliate of Seller that is not
a member of the Company Group (the " _Shared Company Software_ "), Purchasers
shall cause the relevant Company Group Members to grant to Seller or Sellers

 **ARTICLE 7 
 LOSS, CASUALTY AND CONDEMNATION**

  



  

 **Section 7.1 _Notice of Loss_**. Seller shall promptly notify Purchasers
of all instances of Casualty Loss that occur and of which Seller has
Knowledge between the date of this Agreement and Closing.

  



  

 **Section 7.2 _Casualty Loss_**. If, prior to Closing, any Upstream Assets
or Midstream Assets are impacted by a Casualty Loss, Seller and Purchasers
shall meet to attempt to agree on an adjustment to the Purchase Price
reflecting the reduction in value of such assets because of such Casualty
Loss. For this purpose "reduction in value" is based on the principle that
Seller should generally bear the costs of repairing such assets to the state
existing immediately prior to the Casualty Loss, but if such repair results
in equipment or facilities that are newer than or upgraded from that which
existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss, Purchasers should bear a
portion of such costs as is equitable given the benefit to Purchasers of such
newer or upgraded equipment or facilities. No adjustment associated with a
Casualty Loss will exceed the reasonable value claimed by the Purchasers in
the applicable claim to Seller of such Casualty Loss.

  



  

 **Section 7.3 _Disputes_**. If the Parties are unable to agree
on resolution of a Casualty Loss, the Parties shall Close with the Purchase
Price being decreased by Sellers good faith estimate of the reduction in
value associated with such Casualty Loss; provided, however, that within
thirty (30) Days after the Closing Date, any Party may initiate binding
arbitration in accordance with Section 13.6(b) (excluding the application
of Section 13.6(a)) to resolve the dispute. Any claim with respect to
a Casualty Loss not referred to arbitration within thirty (30) Days
following Closing (or, with respect to any Casualty Loss for which Seller
provides notice that it will continue attempting to cure after Closing,
within thirty (30) Days after the one hundred eighty (180) Day period cure
period following Closing has expired) shall be deemed waived by the Parties
for all purposes.

  



        
   

  



  

 **Section 7.4 _Insurance Proceeds_**. Seller shall retain any and all
insurance proceeds, rights to claims made against third parties with respect
to any Casualty Losses and the proceeds from such claims, and other
payments associated with or attributable to any Casualty Losses.

shall prepare and deliver to Purchasers, using and based upon the best
information available to Seller, a preliminary settlement statement
estimating the Adjusted Purchase Price after giving effect to all Purchase

(b) On or before the 120th Day following the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Purchasers a statement setting forth the final
calculation, subject as provided in Section 9.5(d), of the Adjusted Purchase

and final

  



        
   

  



  

determination. Should Deloitte and Touche fail or refuse to serve under this
Section within twenty (20) Days after written request from any Party to
serve, and the Parties fail to agree in writing on a replacement within ten
(10) Days after the end of such twenty (20) Day period, or should no
replacement agree to serve within forty-five (45) Days after the original
written request pursuant to this sentence, an internationally-recognized
independent accounting firm shall be appointed by the International Centre
for Expertise of the International Chamber of Commerce. The accounting firm
once appointed, shall have no ex parte communications with any of the
Parties concerning the determination required hereunder. All communications
between any Party, or its Affiliates, and the accounting firm shall be
conducted in writing, with copies sent simultaneously to the other Party in
the same manner, or at a meeting to which the representatives of both Parties

(5) Days notice. Within ten (10) Days of appointment of the accounting firm,
Purchasers shall present the accounting firm with its statement of proposed
changes and Seller shall present the accounting firm with its response, in
each case together with all other supporting information that it desires,
with a copy to the other Party.  The accounting firms determination shall be
made within 30 Days after the deadline for each Partys submissions and shall
be final and binding on both Parties, without right of appeal.  In
determining the proper amount of any adjustment to the Purchase Price, the
accounting firm shall not increase the Purchase Price more than the increase
proposed by Seller nor decrease the Purchase Price more than the decrease
proposed by Purchasers, as applicable.  The accounting firm shall act as an
expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed matters
submitted by either Party, shall not act as an arbitrator, and may not award
damages or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Seller
and Purchasers shall bear its own consulting fees and other costs of
presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-half and Purchasers shall bear
one-half of the costs and expenses of the accounting firm. Within 10 Days
after the earlier of (i) the expiration of Purchasers 60-Day review period
without delivery of any written report or (ii) the date on which the Parties
or the accounting firm, as applicable, finally determines the disputed
matters, (x) Purchasers shall pay to Seller the amount by which the
Adjusted Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Amount or (y) Seller shall pay
to Purchasers the amount by which the Closing Amount exceeds the Adjusted
Purchase Price, as applicable. Any amounts paid pursuant to this Section 9.5
shall bear interest from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the
Agreed Interest Rate. For the avoidance of doubt, the accounting firm may
only decide accounting matters relating to the calculation of the Adjusted
Purchase Price, and has no authority to decide matters relating to
the validity, enforceability, breach or termination of this Agreement or
any provisions hereof.

  



  

(c) Purchasers shall assist Seller in preparation of the final statement of
the Adjusted Purchase Price under Section 9.5(b) by furnishing invoices,
receipts, reasonable access to personnel and such other assistance as may be
requested by Seller to facilitate such process post-Closing.

9.5(b), Purchase Price adjustments to which the Parties are entitled under
Sections 3.3(g), 3.3(i) and 3.3(j) which becoming owing thereafter shall
be accomplished by cash payment from

  



         
 

  



  

the Party or Parties owing the adjustment to the Party or Parties entitled to
the adjustment within ten (10) days after such amounts becomes owing under
the terms of Section 3.3.

at the time the applicable Major Undisclosed Contracts were entered into and
(B) the terms that such contracts would have had, if they had matched the
prevailing market standard in the oil and gas industry in Colombia at
such time, if, and only if, such reductions in value in aggregate have a
Material Adverse Effect on the value of the Shares (taken as a whole),

  



  

even if such Damages are caused in whole or in part by the negligence
(whether sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of
any Indemnified Person.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
this Section 11.1 contains the Parties exclusive remedies against each other
with respect to breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Parties contained in Articles 4 and 5 and Sections 6.1,

(d) This Article 11 shall not apply to Tax matters (other than Section 4.9 to
Section 4.17, inclusive), which are covered by Article 12 and Section 13.3.

  



  

(e) " _Damages_ ", for purposes of this Article 11, shall mean the amount of
any actual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or judgment incurred
or suffered by any Indemnified Person arising out of or resulting from the
indemnified matter, whether attributable to personal injury or death,
property damage, contract claims (including contractual indemnity claims),
torts, or otherwise, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys,
consultants, accountants or other agents and experts reasonably incident to
matters indemnified against, and the costs of investigation and/or monitoring
of such matters, and the costs of enforcement of the indemnity; provided,
however, that no Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification
under this Section 11.1 for, and "Damages" shall not include, (i) loss of
profits, whether direct or consequential, or other consequential damages
suffered by the Indemnified Party claiming indemnification, or any punitive
damages (other than loss of profits, consequential damages or punitive
damages suffered by Persons other than Indemnified Persons for which an
Indemnified Person has been held liable), (ii) any Taxes that may be assessed
on payments made under this Article 11, and (iii) any liability, loss, cost,

which the Indemnified Person may be entitled.

  



  

(f) The indemnity of each Party provided in this Section 11.1 shall be for
the benefit of and extend to such Partys present and former Affiliates, and
its and their directors, officers, employees, and agents. Any claim
for indemnity under this Section 11.1 by any such Affiliate,
director, officer, employee, or agent must be brought and administered by a
Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Person other than Seller and
Purchasers shall have any rights against either Seller or Purchasers under
the terms of this Section 11.1 except as may be exercised on its behalf by
Purchasers or Seller, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 11.1(f). Seller
and Purchasers may elect to exercise

  



        
   

  



  

or not exercise indemnification rights under this Section on behalf of the
other Indemnified Parties affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall
have no liability to any such other Indemnified Party for any action or
inaction under this Section.

  



  

(g) Purchasers shall not conduct (or have conducted on their behalf) any
material remediation operations with respect to any claimed Damages relating
to a breach of Sellers representation or warranty pursuant to Section 4.18
or any Third Person Claim relating to the subject matter of such
representation or warranty without first giving Seller notice of
the remediation with reasonable detail at least 45 Days prior thereto (or
such shorter period of time as shall be required by Law or any Governmental
Body). Seller shall have the option (in its sole discretion) to conduct (or
have conducted on its behalf) such remediation operations, if it is not
prohibited by Law.  In the event that it is not possible under applicable
Law, Seller may at its option provide support for such remediation operations
if Seller so desires. If for any reason Seller rejects any Purchasers claim
under Article 11, Seller shall not have any right to conduct material
remediation operations or to participate or support such material remediation
operations, notwithstanding the right of Purchasers under Section 13.6. If
Seller shall not have notified Purchasers within such 45-Day period of its
agreement to conduct such remediation operations, then Purchasers may conduct
(or have conducted on its behalf) such operations. Any remediation
activities undertaken with respect to the Upstream Assets or Midstream
Assets, whether conducted by Purchasers or Seller, shall be reasonable in
extent and cost effective and shall not be designed or implemented in such a
manner as to exceed what is required to cause a condition to be brought into
compliance with Environmental Laws. All remediation activities conducted
by Seller under this Agreement shall be conducted to the extent
reasonably possible so as not to interfere substantially with the Companys
operation of the Upstream Assets or Midstream Assets.

  



  

(h) The Parties shall treat any amounts paid under this Article 11 as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permissible by Law.

  



  

 **Section 11.2 _Indemnification Actions_**. All claims for indemnification
under Sections 6.9 and 11.1, shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

  



  

(a) For purposes of this Article 11, the term " _Indemnifying Person_ " when
used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons
having an obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to
such Damages pursuant to this Article 11, and the term " _Indemnified Person_
" when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or
Persons having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages by
another Person or Persons pursuant to this Article 11.

  



  

(b) To make claim for indemnification under Section 11.1, an Indemnified
Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim under this Section
11.2, including the specific details of and specific basis under this
Agreement for its claim (the " _Claim Notice_ "). In the event that the claim
for indemnification is based upon a claim by a third Person against the
Indemnified Person (a " _Third Person Claim_ "), the Indemnified Person shall
provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual
knowledge of the Third Person Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers
(if any)

  



        
   

  



  

served with respect to the Third Person Claim; provided that the failure of
any Indemnified Person to give notice of a Third Person Claim as provided in
this Section 11.2 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its
obligations under Section 11.1 except to the extent such failure results in
insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to
effectively defend against the Third Person Claim or otherwise prejudices the
Indemnifying Persons ability to defend against the Third Person Claim. In
the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or
breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice
shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which was
inaccurate or breached.

  



  

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Person
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have 30 Days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Third Person Claim
under this Article 11.  If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the
Indemnified Person within such 30-Day period whether the Indemnifying Person
admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it shall be
conclusively deemed obligated to provide such indemnification hereunder. The
Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such 30-Day period, to
file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or
appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Person and
that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.

  



  

(d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third
Person Claim, if it is not prohibited by Law. The Indemnifying Person shall
have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise
or settlement thereof, if it is not prohibited by Law, and upon request of an
Indemnifying Person, an Indemnified Person shall provide such Indemnifying
Person a power of attorney or any other authorization reasonably requested to
take all actions on behalf of such Indemnified Person reasonably necessary to
allow such Indemnifying Person to fully perform such defense and proceedings.
If requested by the Indemnifying Person, or if it is necessary under
applicable Law to give real effect to this provision, the Indemnified Person
agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third Person Claim which the
Indemnifying Person elects to contest ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or cross-
complaint against any Person). The Indemnified Person may at its own expense
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third
Person Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section
11.2(d), if it is not prohibited by Law. An Indemnifying Person shall
not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any Third
Person Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto
which (i) does not result in a final resolution of the Indemnified
Persons liability with respect to the Third Person Claim (including, in the
case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnified
Person from all further liability with respect to the Third Person Claim) or
(ii) may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than
as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

  



        
   

  



  

(e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Third Person Claim,
then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Third
Person Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of
the Indemnified Persons choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying
Person to admit its obligation and assume the defense of the Third Person
Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If
the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to
provide indemnification with respect to a Third Person Claim, the Indemnified
Person shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed
settlement and the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for 10 Days
following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation to
provide indemnification with respect to the Third Person Claim and (ii) if
its obligation is so admitted, assume the defense of the Third Person Claim
and reject the proposed settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any
Third Person Claim over the objection of the Indemnifying Person after the
Indemnifying Person has timely admitted its obligation in writing and assumed
the defense of a Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed
to have waived any right to indemnity therefor.

  



  

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Person
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have 30 Days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its obligation
to provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii) dispute
the claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the
Indemnified Person within such 30 Day period that it has cured the Damages or
that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying Person shall be
conclusively deemed obligated to provide such indemnification hereunder.

[ **Redaction of indemnification matters** ]

  



  

(h) Purchasers have agreed that, at Closing, the Company and other relevant
Company Group Members shall grant a Power of Attorney as described in Section
9.3(d). **[Redaction of indemnification matters** ] Any costs associated
with the exercise of the rights of the Power of Attorney shall be borne by
Seller. The Parties intend that the assignment leave the Seller or its
designee no worse off in terms of ability to pursue such claims than they
would have been had they been in the position of the relevant Company Group
Member originally holding such claims. Notwithstanding the preceding, should
an assignment take place prior to the Closing pursuant to the terms
of Section 6.5, then no

  



        
   

  



  

Power of Attorney or assignment shall be granted pursuant to the terms of
this Section 11.2(h) with respect to the claims subject to the pre-
Closing assignment.

months (unless a shorter period is expressly provided within the
applicable section). The Fundamental Representations shall survive without
time limit. The representations and warranties in Section 4.9 to Section 4.17
shall survive the Closing for a period of seven (7) years. The remainder of
this Agreement shall survive the Closing without time limit except as may
otherwise be expressly provided herein.  Representations, warranties,

bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration date.

11.1(b)(ii) and Section 11.1(b)(iii) shall terminate twelve (12) months after
the Closing, except to the extent that they relate to the representations and
warranties in Section 4.9 to Section 4.17 inclusive, in which case they shall
terminate seven years after Closing; and except to the extent that they
relate to the Fundamental Representations, in which case they shall not
terminate, provided that, in relation to each representation and warranty
that is subject to a termination date, termination shall not affect matters
for which a specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the
Indemnifying Person on or before the relevant termination date. The
indemnity in Section 11.1(b)(vii) shall terminate six (6) months after the
Closing. The indemnity in Section 11.1(b)(i) shall terminate eighteen (18)
months after the Closing. The indemnities in Section 11.1(a)(i), Section
11.1(b)(iv), Section 11.1(b)(v) and Section 11.1(b)(vi) shall
continue indefinitely, provided that the indemnity in Section 11.1(b)(vi)
shall terminate if any Power of Attorney terminates, expires, or becomes
otherwise invalid or unenforceable (other than as a result of the
voluntary relinquishment by Seller, except as a result of receipt of an
assignment (" _ceder derechos litigiosos_ ")), or an assignment (" _ceder
derechos litigiosos_ ")

  



        
   

  



  

is not delivered as required under Section 11.2(h), provided further, that
such indemnity shall be reinstated if Purchasers cause the delivery of
another Power of Attorney to replace the terminated, expired, invalid or
unenforceable Power of Attorney or delivery of such assignment (" _ceder
derechos litigiosos_ "), as applicable. Indemnities shall be of no further
force and effect after the date of their expiration, provided that there
shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to such an indemnity prior to its expiration
date.

  



  

(c) Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under Section
11.1(b) (excluding Sections 11.1(b)(iv) and 11.1(b)(v)): (i) for any Damages
with respect to any occurrence, claim, award or judgment that do not
individually exceed US$250,000 (the " _Individual Claim Threshold_ "); or
(ii) unless and until the aggregate Damages for which Claim Notices for
claims meeting the Individual Claim Threshold are delivered by Purchaser
exceed US$10 million, and then only to the extent such Damages exceed US$10
million. Notwithstanding the preceding, this Section 11.3(c) shall not limit
Sellers liability with respect to breaches of any Fundamental
Representation.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, Seller shall not collectively be required to indemnify Purchaser
under this Article 11 for aggregate Damages in excess of twenty-five percent
(25%) of the Purchase Price, but for purposes of such calculation, Damages
recovered under Sections 11.1(b)(iv) and 11.1(b)(v) shall not be included.
Notwithstanding the preceding, this Section 11.3(d) shall not limit Sellers
liability with respect to breaches of any Fundamental Representation.

  



  

(e) The adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 3.3, Tax obligations
pursuant to Article 12 and Section 13.3, and any payments in respect of any
of the preceding shall not be limited by Sections 11.3(c) and 11.3(d).

  



  

(f) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnity under this Article 11 shall be reduced by the amount of insurance
proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with respect to
such Damages (net of any collection costs, and excluding the proceeds of any
insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified Person or its
Affiliates).

  



  

(g) In no event shall any Indemnified Person be entitled to duplicate
compensation with respect to the same Damage, liability, loss, cost, expense,
claim, award or judgment under more than one provision of this Agreement and
the various documents delivered in connection with the Closing.

taxable period beginning on or prior to the Effective Time and ending after
the Effective Time which is allocable by the provisions of Section 12.1(c) to
the portion of such period occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
any Non-Ordinary Course Tax Liability (iii) any Post-Completion Tax
Liability but excluding in all cases any Tax Liability provided for in
Section 13.3, and in each case, save to the extent that (A) provision or
reserve was made in the Financial Statements dated as of the Effective Time
and where such provision or reserve was taken into account in the calculation
of Working Capital for the purposes of Section 3.3 **,** (B) such Tax
Liability arises or is increased as a result of any change in rates of Tax
made after the Effective Time or of any change in Law (or change
in interpretation of the Law) or any amendment or withdrawal of a Tax
Authoritys practice or concession, or any change in accounting standards,
practice or principles which is announced after the Effective Time, (C) such
Tax Liability would not have arisen or would have been lower but for any
act, omission or transaction carried out by or at the written request of
the Purchasers after the Effective Time or any Company Group Member after
the Closing, or (D) such Tax Liability relates to interest, penalties or
additional amounts which are attributable to the delay or default of
Purchasers or any Company Group Member after Closing.

for a taxable period beginning on or prior to and ending after the Effective
Time which is allocable to the portion of such period occurring on or prior
to the Effective Time or to the portion of such period occurring at or after

property, ad valorem or similar Taxes (which are not based on or measured
by production), by allocating all such Taxes on a per diem basis, (ii) in
the case of franchise, capital or similar Taxes (which are not based on or

returns, and all such claims, disclaimers, surrenders and elections as may be
directed by the Seller relating to such accounting period, to be filed
without amendment or undue delay, with the appropriate Tax Authority on a
timely basis and shall (subject to any right of indemnification under Section
12.1) cause the amount of Taxes shown to be due on such Tax return to be paid

amendment would be contrary to Law.

  



  

(b) With respect to each Tax Return for, by or with respect to any Company
Group Member with respect to any accounting period ending after the Closing

Seller is responsible, in whole or in part, under the terms of

  



        
   

  



  

Section 12.1, Purchasers shall, within thirty (30) Days, notify Seller in
writing thereof. As to any such Tax Liability for which Seller is
exclusively responsible in accordance with Section 12.1, Seller shall be
entitled, at its expense, to control or settle the contest of such
examination, claim, adjustment or other proceeding, provided that (a) Seller
notifies Purchasers of its desire to control or settle such contest not later
than fifteen (15) Days after receipt by Seller of such notice (b) Seller may
not, without the prior written consent of Purchasers, agree to any settlement
which could result in an increase in the amount of Taxes of any Company Group
Member for which Purchasers are responsible, in whole or in part, for Taxes
under the terms of Section 12.1. Seller shall be entitled to resist any Tax
Claim that relates to Tax for which it may be responsible under Section 12.1,
provided that it shall keep Purchasers informed of all relevant material
matters pertaining to such Tax Claim, and shall cause any material written
communication relating to the Tax Claim to be submitted to Purchasers for
their approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
prior to transmitting such communication to the Tax Authority. Seller and
each Purchaser shall cooperate with each other, and with their respective
Affiliates, and will consult with each other in the negotiation and
settlement of any proceeding described in this Section 12.5 that could affect
the other. Each Purchaser shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Seller
and its Affiliates necessary authorizations, including powers of attorney, to
control any proceeding which Seller is entitled to control pursuant to this
Section 12.5.

  



  

 **Section 12.6 _Refunds_**. Purchasers agree to pay to Seller within thirty
(30) Days after receipt of an amount equal to any refund of Tax
received (whether by payment, credit, offset, or otherwise, together with any
interest received thereon) after the Closing by Purchasers and their
respective Affiliates, including the Company Group Members, with respect to
Taxes for which Seller is responsible or required to indemnify Purchasers
under Section 12.1 to the extent that such refund of Tax or the right
thereto was not taken into account in the calculation of Working Capital for
the purposes of Section 3.3. Purchasers shall notify Seller within thirty
(30) Days after discovery of a right to claim any such refund and shall
reasonably cooperate with Seller and Sellers Affiliates in taking the
necessary steps to claim any such refund.

  



  

 **Section 12.7 _Overprovisions_**. The Seller may require the auditors of
any Company Group Member to certify the existence and amount of any
overprovision in the Financial Statements dated as of the Effective Time
which were taken into account in the calculation of Working Capital for the
purposes of Section 3.3 and Purchasers shall procure that the relevant
Company Group Member provides any information or assistance reasonably
required for this purpose. If the auditors otherwise discover an
overprovision in the Financial Statements dated as of the Effective
Time which were taken into account in the calculation of Working Capital for
the purposes of Section 3.3, Purchaser, Purchasers shall promptly notify
the Seller. Any provision in the Financial Statements dated as of the
Effective Time that is proved to be an overprovision and which was taken into
account in the calculation of Working Capital for the purposes of Section 3.3
shall (a) first be set off against any payment then due from Seller
to Purchasers in respect of a successful claim under Section 12.1, (b)
to the extent that there is any excess a refund shall be made to Seller of
any previous payment made to Purchasers (and not previously refunded)
under Section 12.1, such refund to be paid

  



        
   

  



  

within five Days of the issue of the certificate by the auditors; and (c) to
the extent that there is still an excess the remainder of the excess shall be
carried forward and set against any future payments which become due from the
Seller to the Purchasers under Section 12.1. For the purposes of this
Section 12.7, an overprovision exists if (ignoring the effect of any change
in Law made or action taken by Purchasers or the relevant Company Group
Member after the Effective Time) any liability in respect of Tax (including
deferred Tax), or any contingency or provision in respect of Tax, has been
overstated in the Financial Statements dated as of the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the above: (a) no provision in respect of a deferred
Tax Liability shall be capable of being taken into account as an
overprovision pursuant to this Section 12.7; (b) to the extent that an
overprovision has given rise to a refund of Tax in respect of which a payment
has been made by Purchaser under Section 12.6, it shall not be taken into
account as an overprovision pursuant to this Section 12.7; and (c) for
the avoidance of doubt, no account shall be taken in this Section 12.7 of
a provision which was not taken into account in the calculation of
Working Capital for the purposes of Section 3.3.

  



  

 **Section 12.8 _Due Date of Payment_**

  



  

(a) Where a payment falls to be made under this Article 12, the payment shall
be made in cleared funds and the due date for the making of that payment
shall be:

  



  

(i) where notice is given before the last date upon which the Tax concerned
can be paid without the person liability to pay it incurring a liability to
interest or a charge or penalty in respect of it, that date; and

  



  

(ii) in any other case, the date falling seven Days after the date upon which
the person liable to make the payment has been notified by the party entitled
to claim it that it is due; and

  



  

(b) If any payment required to be made under this Article 12 is not made by
the due date for the making thereof, then that payment shall carry interest
from that due date until the date when the payment is actually made at the
Agreed Interest Rate.

  



  

 **Section 12.9 _Deductions from payments, etc._ **All sums payable by a
liable Party under Article 12 shall be paid free and clear of all deductions
or withholdings whatsoever, save only as may be required by Law.

the provisions of this Article 12 and any other provision of this
Agreement, this Article 12 shall control.

 **Section 13.6 _Dispute Resolution_**. Any Dispute shall be exclusively
resolved pursuant to this Section 13.6.

  



  

(a) The Parties shall attempt to amicably resolve all Disputes of which one

notices. If after said ninety (90) Day period the Dispute remains unresolved,
either Party may refer the Dispute for a final resolution by arbitration in
accordance with Section 13.6(b).

  



  

(b) All arbitrations shall be conducted in accordance with the following:

  



  

(i) All Disputes referred to this Section 13.6(b) shall be resolved in
accordance with the ICC Rules.  If the ICC Rules are in conflict with this

(ii) Any Dispute referred to Section 13.6(b) shall be heard and determined by
an arbitral tribunal of three arbitrators. Each Party shall appoint one

Party, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICC Court in accordance
with the ICC Rules. If an arbitrator fails or is unable

  



        
   

  



  

to act, his successor will be appointed in the same manner as the arbitrator

(v) Subject to any provisional order to the contrary pursuant to Section
13.6(b)(vii), each Party shall continue to perform its obligations during the
continuation of the resolution of any Dispute pursuant to this Section
13.6(b).

  



  

(vi) Except as provided in Section 13.6(b)(vii) and Section 13.6(b)(xiii),
the Parties and all other Persons that are beneficiaries of or bound by the
terms of this Agreement hereby waive any rights of application or appeal to
any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law in connection with any question of law or fact
arising in the course of the arbitration or with respect to any award made,
including any right to appeal any question of law to the courts of England
under Sections 45 or 69 of the Arbitration Act of 1996.

of any Party to comply with the arbitral tribunals orders to that effect.
The Parties and all other Persons that are beneficiaries of or bound by the
terms of this Agreement waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, any right to apply to any court or other Governmental Body for any
provisional remedies prior to or during the pendency of any arbitration
proceeding hereunder, including any such right under Article 23(2) of the ICC
Rules (or any successor rules), except that any Party may apply to any court

granted by the arbitration tribunal, and an application for such an order
shall not be deemed a violation or waiver of this Agreement.

  



  

(viii) The arbitral tribunal is prohibited from awarding punitive damages.

  



  

(ix) Legal professional privilege, including privileges protecting attorney-
client communications and attorney work product of each Party from

  



        
   

  



  

compelled disclosure or use in evidence, legal advice privilege and
litigation privilege, as recognized by the Laws governing each Partys
relationship with its counsel, shall apply to and be binding in any
arbitration proceeding conducted under this Section 13.6(b).

  



  

(x) Except to the extent necessary to enforce the arbitration agreement or
award, to enforce other rights of the Parties hereunder, or as required by
applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange on which the shares of
Party or any of its Affiliates are listed or are in the process of being
listed, each Party and its Affiliates, and all of the officers, employees,
agents, counsel, consultants, factual witnesses and expert witnesses of each
of them, shall maintain as confidential the fact of the
arbitration proceedings, the arbitral award and all documents prepared and
submitted in connection with the arbitration.

  



  

(xi) The arbitrators shall make the award and any other decisions or rulings
strictly according to Law and shall not make an award or decision _ex aequo
et bono_ or as _amiable compositeur._

  



  

(xii) Any award rendered by the arbitrators hereunder shall be in writing and
signed by a majority of the arbitrators and shall be final and binding upon
the Parties as from the date rendered, and shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy between the Parties regarding any claims, counterclaims, issues or
accounting presented to the arbitral tribunal. Judgment upon any award may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

  



  

(xiii) Each Party and each other Person that is a beneficiary of or bound by
the terms of this Agreement hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the High Court of Justice, London, England in any action, suit or proceeding
with respect to the enforcement of or in aid of the arbitration provisions in
this Section 13.6(b) and the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such court with
respect to the enforcement of any award thereunder and waives any right to
assert that any such action, suit or proceeding has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

  



  

(xiv) The costs of the arbitration (including the awarding of attorneys fees
and other arbitration costs of a Party) shall be apportioned and awarded in
accordance with the ICC Rules.

  



  

Each Party, as to itself (and, as to its Affiliates that are beneficiaries of
or bound by the terms of this Agreement) and its (and their) assets,
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right of immunity and
agrees not to claim or assert any immunity with respect to the matters
covered by this Agreement or any arbitration, suit or action with respect to
this Agreement, whether arising by statute or otherwise, which it may have or
may subsequently acquire, including rights under the doctrines of sovereign
immunity and act of state, immunity from legal process (including service of
process or notice, pre-judgment or pre-award attachment, attachment in aid of
execution, or otherwise), immunity from jurisdiction or judgment of any
court, arbitrator or tribunal (including any objection or claim on the basis
of inconvenient

  



        
   

  



  

forum), and immunity from enforcement or execution of any award or judgment
or any other remedy.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 13.6 shall be

of the United Kingdom or in accordance with the ICC Rules without having to
follow the procedural requirements set out above in the case of Disputes
relating to breaches of the confidentiality obligations of Section 6.1,
breaches of Section 6.4, 6.5(ii), 6.5(iii), 6.5(vi), 6.5(vii), 6.6(b),

owed by an instrument signed by such Party or Parties and expressly

deemed or shall constitute a waiver of, or consent to a change in, other
provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute
a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

  



  

 **Section 13.9 _Assignment_**. No Party shall assign all or any part of
this Agreement, nor shall any Party assign or delegate any of its rights or
duties hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other Party and
