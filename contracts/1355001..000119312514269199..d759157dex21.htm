THE OFFER

 

Section 2.01 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 11.01, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in
no event later than five Business Days following the date of this Agreement,
Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent

 



7  shall cause it to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the 1934
Act) the Offer at the Offer Price. The Offer shall be subject to the
conditions set forth in Annex II hereto (the "Offer Conditions"). The date on
which Merger Subsidiary commences (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
1934 Act) the Offer is referred to as the "Offer Commencement Date."

 

(b) Parent and Merger Subsidiary expressly reserve the right to waive any of
the Offer Conditions and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to
the Offer, including raising the Offer Price; _provided_ that, without the
prior written consent of the Company, neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary
shall:

 

(i) waive or change the Minimum Condition;

 

(ii) decrease the Offer Price;

 

(iii) change the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer (other than by
adding consideration);

 

(iv) decrease the number of Shares sought in the Offer;

 

(v) extend, accelerate or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer
except as otherwise provided herein; or

 

(vi) impose additional Offer Conditions or otherwise amend, modify or
supplement any of the Offer Conditions or terms of the Offer in a manner that
adversely affects the holders of the Shares.

(c) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall expire on
the date that is 20 Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the 1934 Act) after the Offer Commencement Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, but subject to the Parties respective termination rights
in Section 11.01, (i) Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause it to,
extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof or Nasdaq
applicable to the Offer or for any period otherwise required by Applicable
Law and (ii) if, on the initial expiration date or any subsequent date as of
which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any Offer Condition is not satisfied
and has not been waived, then Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause
it to, extend the Offer for one or more periods (each not exceeding ten days
in length except as required by Applicable Law) to permit such Offer Condition
to be satisfied; _provided_ that in no event shall Merger Subsidiary be
required to extend the Offer beyond the End Date. The Offer may be terminated
prior to its expiration date (as such expiration date may be extended and re-
extended in accordance with this Section 2.01(c)), but only if this Agreement
is validly terminated in accordance with Article 11.

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions, Merger
Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause it to, promptly after the expiration
of the Offer, accept for payment all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer (the time at which Shares are first accepted for
payment under the Offer, the "Acceptance Time"). The obligation of Merger
Subsidiary to accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall
be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the Offer Conditions
(and shall not be subject to any other conditions). Promptly after the
Acceptance Time, Merger Subsidiary shall pay the Offer Price for such Shares
in accordance with the Offer and this Agreement.

 



8 (e) Following expiration of the Offer, Merger Subsidiary may in its discretion
and shall, if requested by the Company, provide a subsequent offering period
("Subsequent Offering Period") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the 1934 Act
if, immediately following the Acceptance Time, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates beneficially own less than 90%
of the Shares outstanding at that time (which Shares beneficially owned shall
include Shares tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn). Merger Subsidiary
shall, and Parent shall cause it to, immediately accept for payment and
promptly pay for all Shares as they are validly tendered during such
Subsequent Offering Period and in any event in compliance with Rule 14d-11 and
Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the 1934 Act. The Offer shall terminate
immediately upon a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 11.

(f) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") that shall include
the summary term sheet required thereby and, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal, a form of summary advertisement and
any schedule or form required to be filed pursuant to the Instructions to
Schedule TO (collectively, together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "Offer Documents") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares to the extent required by Applicable Law
(including the 1934 Act). The Offer shall be conducted in compliance with
Applicable Law (including the 1934 Act). The Company shall promptly supply
Parent and Merger Subsidiary in writing, for inclusion in the Offer
Documents, all information concerning the Company required under the 1934 Act
to be included in the Offer Documents.

(g) The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents each time before
any such document is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by
the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall provide the
Company and its counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether
written or oral, that Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their counsel may receive
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or
Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those comments or other
communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
response of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to those comments and to provide
comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration
shall be given), including by participating with Parent and Merger Subsidiary
or their counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC. Each of Parent
and Merger Subsidiary shall respond as promptly as practicable to any comments
of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer.

 

(h) Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company agrees promptly to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO and the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
(or shall have become known to be) false or misleading in any material
respect, and each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by Applicable Law (including the 1934 Act).

 

(i) Parent shall cause to be provided to Merger Subsidiary all of the funds
necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Subsidiary becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer (including pursuant to any Subsequent Offering
Period), and shall cause Merger Subsidiary to perform all of Merger
Subsidiarys obligations under this Agreement on a timely basis.

 



9 Section 2.02 _Company Action_.

 

(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that the board of
directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors"), at a meeting duly called
and held at which all directors of the Company were present, has unanimously
(i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in
accordance with the requirements of the DGCL, the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, (iii) if required by Applicable Law, directed that
this Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for adoption
and approval and (iv) subject to Section 7.04, recommended acceptance of the
Offer and approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby by its stockholders (such recommendation, the "Company
Board Recommendation"). The Company has been advised that all of its
directors and executive officers who own Shares intend to tender their Shares
pursuant to the Offer. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall
promptly (but in any event within five Business Days after the date hereof)
furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any
available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in
stock depositories, in each case true and correct as of the most recent
practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional information
(including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of
securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably
request in connection with the Offer. Except for such steps as are necessary
to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Merger, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their Affiliates,
associates, agents and advisors, shall keep such information confidential and
use the information contained in any such labels, listings and files only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, should the Offer terminate or if
this Agreement shall be terminated, will deliver to the Company all copies of
such information then in their possession.

(b) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall
file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by Applicable Law (including the 1934 Act), the Companys
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that, subject to its
right to withdraw, modify or amend such recommendation pursuant to Section
7.04, shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation. Each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees promptly to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 (including the information
statement containing the information required by Section 14(f) of the 1934
Act and Rule 14f-1

 



10  promulgated thereunder (together with any amendments or supplements thereto,
the "Information Statement")) if and to the extent that it shall have become
(or shall have become known to be) false or misleading in any material
respect. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC
and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the extent
required by Applicable Law (including the 1934 Act). Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time before it is filed with the SEC,
and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel. The Company
shall provide Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel with (i) any
comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that the Company
or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments or
other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the Companys response to those comments and to provide comments on that
response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given),
including by participating with the Company or its counsel in any discussions
or meetings with the SEC. The Company shall respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the recommendation of the Board of Directors contained in the
Schedule 14D-9.

Section 2.03 _Directors_.

 

(a) Effective upon the Acceptance Time, Parent shall be entitled to designate
the number of directors, rounded up to the nearest whole number, on the Board
of Directors that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on
the Board of Directors (giving effect to the election of any additional
directors pursuant to this Section) and (ii) the percentage that the
number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary
(including Shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares
outstanding on a Fully Diluted basis, and the Company shall cause Parents
designees to be elected or appointed to the Board of Directors, including by
increasing the number of directors, and seeking and accepting resignations of
incumbent directors; _provided_ that, Parent shall be entitled to designate at
least a majority of the directors on the Board of Directors at all times
following the Acceptance Time; and _provided further_ that, prior to the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors shall always have at least one
Continuing Director. At such time, the Company shall also cause individuals
designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the
next whole number, on each committee of the Board of Directors that represents
the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Board of Directors,
in each case to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and the rules of
Nasdaq. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary
acquires a majority of the outstanding Shares on a Fully Diluted basis, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all of
the members of the Board of Directors and such committees and boards as of the
date hereof who are not employees of the Company remain members of the Board
of Directors and such committees and boards until the Effective Time.

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Board of
Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall
include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and
its officers and directors, as Section

 



11  14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill its obligations under this
Section 2.03, so long as Parent shall have timely provided to the Company all
information with respect to Parent and its designees, officers, directors and
Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be solely
responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees,
officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of
the directors of the Company then in office who were not designated by Parent
(the "Continuing Directors") shall be required to authorize (and such
authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Board of Directors
and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any
other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize): (i) any
termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any amendment of
this Agreement requiring action by the Board of Directors, (iii) any
extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary, (iv) any waiver of compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, and
(v) any other consent, action or recommendation by the Company or the Board of
Directors with respect to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated thereby or in connection therewith to the extent
such consent, action or recommendation could reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the Company or the holders of the Shares
(other than Parent and Merger Subsidiary). The Continuing Directors shall
have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel
to the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined
appropriate by the Continuing Directors and shall have the authority
to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce the performance
of this Agreement.

(d) In the event that, prior to the Effective Time, no Continuing Directors
remain for any reason whatsoever, the other directors shall designate one
Person who shall not be an Affiliate, shareholder or employee of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed
to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement.

Section 2.04 _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) Subject to Sections 2.04(b) and 2.04(c), the Company grants to Merger
Subsidiary an irrevocable option, for so long as this Agreement has not been
terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof (the "Top-Up Option"), to
purchase from the Company the number of authorized and unissued Shares equal
to the number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned
by Merger Subsidiary at the time of the exercise of the Top-Up Option,
constitutes one Share more than 90% of the Shares that would be outstanding
immediately after the issuance of all Shares to be issued upon exercise of the
Top-Up Option (such Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option,
the "Top-Up Shares").

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Subsidiary in whole (and not
in part) only once, at any time during the five-Business Day period following
the Acceptance Time, or if any Subsequent Offering Period is provided, during
the five-Business Day period following the expiration date of such Subsequent
Offering Period, and only if Merger Subsidiary shall own as of such time less
than 90% of the Shares outstanding; _provided_ that,

 



12  notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up
Option shall not be exercisable (i) to the extent the number of Shares
issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the number of
authorized but unissued and unreserved Shares, (ii) if any judgment,
injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option
or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares, and (iii) unless Parent or Merger
Subsidiary has accepted for payment all Shares validly tendered in the Offer
and not withdrawn. The Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier to occur
of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Article 11. The aggregate purchase price payable for the
Top-Up Shares being purchased by Merger Subsidiary pursuant to the Top-Up
Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Shares by
the Offer Price, without interest. Such purchase price may be paid by Merger
Subsidiary, at its election, either (A) entirely in cash or (B) by paying in
cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of such Top-Up
Shares and by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the balance of such purchase price. Any
such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of 3% per annum, shall
mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. Without the
prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option
granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assigned by Merger Subsidiary
except to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Any
attempted assignment in violation of this Section 2.04(b) shall be null and
void.

 

(c) In the event Merger Subsidiary wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Merger Subsidiary shall deliver to the Company a written notice (the "Top-Up
Notice") setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up Shares that Merger Subsidiary
intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option and (ii) the manner in which
Merger Subsidiary intends to pay the applicable purchase price and (iii) the
place and time at which the closing of the purchase of such Top-Up Shares by
Merger Subsidiary is to take place. The Top-Up Notice shall also include an
undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Subsidiary that, promptly following
such exercise of the Top-Up Option, Merger Subsidiary intends to (and Merger
Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to, promptly after
such exercise) consummate the Merger in accordance with Section 253 of the
DGCL as contemplated by Section 9.05. At the closing of the purchase of the
Top-Up Shares, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall cause to be delivered to the
Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up
Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Subsidiary a
certificate representing the Top-Up Shares. The parties hereto agree to use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of the Top-
Up Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is deemed received
by the Company pursuant to Section 12.01, and if not so consummated on such
day, as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties further agree to use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by Section 9.05 as
close in time as possible to (including, to the extent possible, on the same
day as) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares.

 

(d) Parent and Merger Subsidiary understand that the Top-Up Shares will not be
registered under the 1933 Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-Up
Option is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be, acquired by Merger Subsidiary
for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in
connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the 1933 Act.
Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares shall include any legends required
by applicable securities laws. 

(e) Any dilutive impact on the value of the Shares as a result of the issuance
of the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in any determination of
the fair value of any dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL as
contemplated by Section 3.04.

 



13 ARTICLE III

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 3.01 _The Merger_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, at the
Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with and
into the Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate existence
of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent.

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 10, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe
LLP, 405 Howard Street, San Francisco, California, on the date that is two
Business Days after the last of the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other
than any condition that by its nature is to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of all such
conditions at the Closing) has been satisfied or, to the extent
permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such
conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other date
as Parent and the Company may mutually agree.

 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate
of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such
later time as may be mutually agreed upon by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the
Company and specified in the certificate of merger).

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the property, rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under the DGCL and this
Agreement.

 

Section 3.02 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time:

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.02(b) or Section 3.04, each
Share (including any share of Preferred Stock that automatically converted
into a Share pursuant to the certificate of incorporation of the Company)
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

 



14 (b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent,
Merger Subsidiary or any other Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

 

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 3.03 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, at its expense, appoint a bank
or trust company or similar entity reasonably acceptable to the Company which
is authorized to exercise corporate trust or stock powers to act as Exchange
Agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for
the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing Shares (the
"Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated Shares (the "Uncertificated Shares").
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall provide the Exchange Agent funds
representing the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares pursuant to Section 3.02(a) (the
"Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i)
held for the benefit of the holders of Shares and (ii) promptly applied to
making the payments provided for in Section 3.02(a). The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose that is not provided for herein.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Shares at the Effective Time a
letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the
Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. Each holder of Shares that have
been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or
(ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the
Merger Consideration payable for each Share represented by a Certificate or
for each Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the
case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent
after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or, in the case of
Uncertificated Shares, that such documentation as may be reasonably requested
by Parent or the Exchange Agent is provided and (ii) the Person requesting
such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes
required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent and the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or
is not payable.

 



15 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, without interest,
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, this
Article 3.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares twelve months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged such Shares for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 3.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such
Shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall not be liable to any holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

Section 3.04 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 3.02, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with the DGCL
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise
loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, such Shares shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares that are
in accordance with the DGCL. Except with the prior written consent of Parent,
the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, offer to settle or
settle, any such demands.

 

Section 3.05 _Stock Options; Restricted Stock_.

 

(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase
Shares, whether vested or unvested (each, an "Option"), shall be canceled,
and the Company shall pay each holder of any such Option (less any applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment) at or promptly
after the Effective Time for each such Option an amount in cash determined by
multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the applicable
exercise price of such Option by (ii) the number of Shares such holder could
have purchased had such holder exercised such Option in full immediately
prior to the Effective Time (treating for this purpose all unvested Options as
if they had vested immediately prior to cancellation). Any Option with a per
share exercise price equal to or in excess of the Offer Price shall
be canceled without the payment of any consideration.

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of unvested
restricted stock of the Company outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically become fully vested and free of any
forfeiture restrictions and, at the Effective Time, each such share of
restricted stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

(c) The Company shall take any actions necessary to effect Sections 3.05(a)
and (b).

 



16 Section 3.06 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class (including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange or readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record
date during such period, but excluding any change that results from any
exercise of options outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase Shares
granted under the Companys stock option or compensation plans or
arrangements or the exercise of the Top-Up Option to purchase the Top-Up
Shares), the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

 

Section 3.07 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of Applicable Law relating to Taxes and shall timely pay
such withholding amount to the appropriate Taxing Authority. If the Exchange
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

 

Section 3.08 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or Parent
may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this Article 3.

contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of

or imposition of any Lien on any property, asset or right of the Company,
with only such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (iii) and (iv), as
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 5.05 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 Shares
and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share

3,214,238 Shares were exercisable). All outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Company have been, and all shares that may be issued pursuant to any
employee stock option or other compensation plan or arrangement will be, when
issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized
and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to or
issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first
refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right.

 



19 (b) Except as set forth in Section 5.05(a) and for changes since July 14,
2014 resulting from the exercise of Options, there are no issued, reserved

referred to collectively as the "Company Securities"). There are no
outstanding obligations of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any of the Company Securities. There are no stockholder agreements,
voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the Company is a
party or is otherwise bound with respect to the holding, voting,

Option, the name of the plan under which such Option was granted, the date of
grant, exercise or purchase price, vesting schedule, payment schedule (if

intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the
Code so qualifies, and the exercise price of each other Option is no less than
the fair market value of a Share as determined on the date of grant of such
Option. The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of
the forms of all agreements evidencing outstanding Options. Other than with
respect to Options, the Company has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or

nor is it currently subject to, any audit or examination, or, to the knowledge

reasonable steps in accordance with industry standards to secure such systems
from unauthorized access or use by any Person, and to ensure the continued,

accounting methods employed, prior to the Closing.

that action of its intention to do so, and specifies the reasons therefor,
including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the Person making,
such Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishes a copy (if any) of the
proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other relevant
transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new written notice by the Company and a new three day period); and

 

(B) if Parent makes a proposal during such three day period to adjust the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Board of Directors, after taking
into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as
proposed by Parent, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Superior Proposal
continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement, as applicable, would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under Applicable Law.

 

During the three day period prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminating this Agreement as provided above, the Company shall,
and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions
to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed
by Parent.

So long as the Company and its Representatives have otherwise complied with
this Section 7.04, none of the foregoing shall prohibit the Company and its
Representatives from contacting any Person or group of Persons that have made
an Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement to request
clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether
such Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a
Superior Proposal, and such actions shall not be a breach of this Section
7.04. In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of
Directors from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2(a)

 



36  under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that
any such action taken or statement made that relates to an Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Board of Directors reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such
statement or in connection with such action or (ii) issuing a "stop, look and
listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act (which it is agreed shall not constitute an
Adverse Recommendation Change).

(c)  _Required Notices_. The Board of Directors shall not take any of the
actions referred to in Section 7.04 (other than those described in the last
paragraph of Section 7.04(b)) unless the Company shall have delivered to
Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such
action. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event
later than one Business Day) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of, any indication by any Person that it is considering
making, or any inquiry or request for information, discussion or negotiation
that is reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates, an Acquisition
Proposal, including the material terms and conditions thereof, and shall keep
Parent reasonably informed as to the status (including changes to the material
terms) of such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall also notify Parent
promptly (but in no event later than one Business Day) after receipt by the
Company of any request for non-public information relating to the Company or
for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company by any Third Party that has informed the Company that it is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal.

(d) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (
_provided_ that, for the purposes of this definition, references to "25% or
more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed replaced
with references to "more than 50%") that was not received as a result of a
breach of Section 7.04(a) and that the Board of Directors determines in good
faith by a majority vote, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisor, is reasonably likely to be consummated substantially in accordance
with its terms (taking into account all legal, regulatory, and financial
aspects of the proposal and Person making such proposal) and would, if
consummated, result in a transaction more favorable, from a financial point
of view, to the Companys stockholders than as provided hereunder (including
any adjustment to the terms proposed by Parent in response to such proposal).

 

(e) _Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, (i) cease immediately and
cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its Representatives and its
financing sources conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of
all confidential information previously furnished with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (to the extent provided by the applicable confidentiality
agreement), and (iii) not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any
provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives is a party with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, and shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement.

Section 7.05 _Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company (acting through its Compensation Committee) will take all steps that
may be necessary or

 



37  advisable to cause each Employee Plan pursuant to which consideration is
payable to any officer, director or employee as an "employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the 1934 Act to be approved by the Compensation Committee
(comprised solely of "independent directors" determined in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the 1934 Act and the instructions
thereto) as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the 1934 Act and to
satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule
14d-10(d) of the 1934 Act.

Section 7.06 _Directors_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
cause each member of the Board of Directors to execute and deliver a letter
effectuating his or her resignation as a director of the Board of Directors
effective as of the Effective Time.

 

Section 7.07 _FIRPTA Affidavit_. No earlier than thirty (30) days prior to the
Acceptance Time, and if the Closing does not occur within thirty (30) days of
the Acceptance Time, if requested by Parent, the Company shall deliver to
Parent (i) an affidavit, under penalty of perjury, prepared in accordance with
the requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3)(i)
and 1.897-2(h)(2) certifying that the interests in the Company are not "United
States real property interests" under Section 897(c) of the Code, and (ii) a
letter of notice to the IRS prepared in accordance with the requirements set
forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2).

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any action, suit,
investigation or proceeding (whether or not arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is brought against any Indemnified Person on or prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 8.03
shall continue in effect until the final resolution of such action, suit,

period or time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance

of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company by
reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or

shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300%
of the amount per annum the Company paid in its current policy year, which
amount is set forth in Section 8.03(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and
_provided further_ that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Company shall obtain a tail policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective

Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as

the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, for a period of
at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date hereof with the Companys current insurance carrier or

Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase from the Companys
current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect
to DandO Insurance

 



39  comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided
in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ that in
no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for
such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of
300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its current policy year,
which amount is set forth in Section 8.03(c) of the Company Disclosure

and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

(b) Parent shall provide credit for each Continuing Employees length of
service with the Company for all purposes (including eligibility, vesting and
benefit accrual) under each plan, program, policy or arrangement of Parent and
its Affiliates to the same extent that such service was recognized under a
similar plan, program, policy or arrangement of the Company as of Closing;
_provided_ that such prior service credit shall not be required under any
defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that it results in a duplication
of benefits.

 



40 (c) Parent shall cause each benefit plan of Parent and its Affiliates in which
any Continuing Employee participates that provides for medical, dental,
health, pharmaceutical or vision benefits (each, a "Parent Welfare Plan") to

conditions with respect to participation and coverage requirements, other
than limitations that were in effect with respect to such Continuing Employee
as of immediately prior to the Closing under the corresponding Employee Plan,
(ii) honor any payments, charges and expenses of such Continuing Employee
(and his or her eligible dependents) that were applied toward the deductible,
out-of-pocket maximums and co-payments under an Employee Plan in satisfying
any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums and co-payments under the
corresponding Parent Welfare Plan during the same plan year in which such
payments, charges and expenses were made, and (iii) waive any waiting period
limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be
applicable to such Continuing Employee following the Closing to the extent
that such Continuing Employee had satisfied any similar limitation under the
corresponding Employee Plan.

 

(d) Effective as of the day before the Closing, the Company shall take such
corporate actions as are necessary to freeze as to new participants the
Companys 401(k) plan. The Company shall provide copies of such actions to
Parent at least five (5) Business Days before the Closing for its reasonable
review and comment. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take
such actions as are necessary for Continuing Employees to participate in the
Parents 401(k) plan as soon as reasonably practicable (in any event, not to
exceed six (6) months) following the Closing. Further, Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to take any actions necessary to permit
Continuing Employees the ability to rollover their account balances from the
Companys 401(k) plan into the Parents 401(k) Plan, including participant
loans made under the Companys 401(k) plan that are outstanding as of the
Closing Date.

(e) Nothing express or implied in this Section 8.04 shall (i) be treated as
an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any Employee Plan or any employee
benefit plan of Parent or any Affiliate, (ii) prohibit Parent or any of its
Affiliates from amending any Employee Plan, (iii) require Parent or any of
its Affiliates to continue the employment of any Continuing Employee for any
period of time or, subject to any applicable arrangement covering such
Continuing Employee, to provide such Continuing Employee with any payments or
benefits upon any termination of such Continuing Employees employment, or
(iv) confer any rights or benefits on any Person other than the parties to
this Agreement.

contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or as required by Applicable Law,
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use commercially reasonable efforts not to
(a) take any action that may reasonably be expected to result in any of the
conditions set forth in Article 10 or in Annex II not to be satisfied, (b)
take any action, or fail to take any action, in either case the result of
which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely impair
or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
beyond the time period contemplated by this Agreement or (c) take any action
the result of which would reasonably be expected to materially and

 



41  adversely affect the Company or its business, including the solicitation or
hiring of the Companys employees or the solicitation of the Companys
customers, in each case, to the extent set forth in Section 8.05 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary covenant and agree with the Company that between
the date hereof and the earlier of the date on which the Offer Conditions are
satisfied and the Termination Date, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall not,
and Parent shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter or agree to
enter into any definitive agreement for the acquisition of any business, or
take or agree to take any other action, in either case that could reasonably
be expected to materially interfere with Parents ability to make available to
the Exchange Agent the funds sufficient for the satisfaction of all of
Parents and Merger Subsidiarys obligations under this Agreement, including
the payment of the amount required in connection with the Offer, payment of
the Merger Consideration and the payment of all associated costs and expenses.

Offer Conditions in (i)(B) or (ii)(A) of Annex II, shall have been satisfied
or shall be capable of being satisfied as of the Extended End Date, the
Company and Parent may mutually agree to extend the Extended End Date to March
15, 2015;

(ii) there shall be any restraining order, permanent injunction or other
order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, or any Applicable Law
enacted after the date hereof, prohibiting the consummation of the Offer or
the Merger, which shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ that
that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
11.01(b)(ii) shall have used its reasonable best efforts to contest, appeal
and remove such restraining order, permanent injunction or other court issued
order; or

(c) by Parent, if:

 

(i) (A) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred, (B) the Company
shall have failed to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of the Offer and
the approval and adoption of this Agreement within 10 Business Days after the
date any Acquisition Proposal or any material modification thereto is first
commenced, published or sent or given to the Companys stockholders upon a
request to do so by Parent, or (C) the Company shall have breached or failed
to perform any of its obligations set forth in Section 7.04 in any material
respect; or

 

(ii) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement (other than with respect to a breach of Section 7.04, as to
which Section 11.01(c)(i)(C) will apply), or if any representation or warranty
of the Company shall have become untrue, which breach or failure to perform or
to be true, either individually or in the aggregate, if occurring or
continuing at the Acceptance Time (A) would result in the failure of any of
the conditions set forth in Section 10.01 or Annex II and (B) cannot be or has
not been cured by the earlier of (1) the End Date or

 



46  Extended End Date, as the case may be, and (2) 30 days after the giving of
written notice to the Company of such breach or failure; _provided_ that
Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 11.01(c)(ii) if Parent or Merger Subsidiary is then in material breach
of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement;

 

(d) by the Company:

(i) at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, in order to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with
Section 7.04; _provided_ that the Company shall have (A) substantially
contemporaneously with such termination entered into the associated
Alternative Acquisition Agreement and (B) paid any amounts due pursuant to
Section 12.04(b);

 

(ii) if Parent or Merger Subsidiary shall have breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform, either individually or in
the aggregate, if occurring or continuing at the Acceptance Time (A) would
result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 10.01 or
Annex II and (B) cannot be or has not been cured by the earlier of (1) the End
Date or the Extended End Date, as the case may be, and (2) 30 days after the
giving of written notice to Parent of such breach or failure;  _provided_
that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 11.01(d)(ii) if it is then in material breach of any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement; or

 

(iii) the initial Offer period or any extension thereof shall have expired
without the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer; provided
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
11.01(d)(iii) shall not be available to the Company if the Companys breach of
any provision of this Agreement results in the failure of the acceptance
for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer.

(e) The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
11.01 (other than pursuant to Section 11.01(a)) shall give written notice of
such termination to the other party.

Section 11.02 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 11.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other
party hereto; provided that, (a) if such termination shall result from the
intentional or willful (i) failure of either party to fulfill a condition to
the performance of the obligations of the other party or (ii) failure of
either party to perform a covenant hereof, such party shall be fully liable
for any and all liabilities and damages (which the parties acknowledge and
agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-
pocket costs, and may include to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain
lost by a partys stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters,
including other combination opportunities and the time value of money), which
shall be deemed in such event to be damages of such party) incurred or
suffered by the other party as a result of such failure and (b) in the case of
fraud each Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law
or in equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section
11.02 and Article 12 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section
11.01.

Effective Time, other than those covenants or agreements of the Parties which
by their terms apply, or are to be performed, in whole or in part, after the
Effective Time.

 

Section 12.03 _Amendments and Waivers_.

 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be

herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 12.04 _Expenses_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such cost or expense.

(b) _Termination Fee_.

 

(i) If this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to Section
11.01(c)(i) or (B) by the Company pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(i), then the
Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available funds $6,600,000 (the
"Termination Fee"), in the case of a termination by Parent, within two
Business Days after such termination and, in the case of a termination by the
Company, at the time of such termination.

 



49 (ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant
to Section 11.01(b)(i) or by Parent pursuant to Section 11.01(c)(ii), (B) any
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or otherwise made known to
the Company prior to the date of termination, and (C) within twelve
months following the date of such termination, the Company shall have entered
into a definitive agreement with respect to or recommended to its stockholders
any Acquisition Proposal, or any Acquisition Proposal shall have been
consummated (which, for the avoidance of doubt, need not be an Acquisition
Proposal that was made, disclosed or communicated prior to termination
hereof), then the Termination Fee shall be payable within two Business Days
after such event or consummation (provided, however, that for purposes of
this Section 12.04(b)(ii), the references to "25% or more" in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "more than 50%").

 

 __(c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree that upon any termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable by the
Company pursuant to this Section and such Termination Fee is paid in full,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be precluded from any other remedy against
the Company, at law or in equity or otherwise, and neither Parent nor
Merger Subsidiary shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of
any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the
Company or any of its directors, officers, employees, partners, managers,
members, shareholders or Affiliates or their respective Representatives in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , that the payment by the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant
to this Section 12.04 shall not relieve the Company from any liability or
damage resulting from a willful and material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or in the case of fraud. The parties acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this Section 12.04 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and if the Company fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 12.04(b) and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Subsidiary commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section
12.04(b) or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger
Subsidiary its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount or portion
thereof at the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.
__

Section 12.05 _Disclosure Schedule_. The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Section of either the Company Disclosure Schedule
or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be an exception to (or,
as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and any other
representations and warranties of such party that is contained in this
Agreement to which the relevance of such item thereto is reasonably
apparent on its face. The mere inclusion of an item in either the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to (or,
as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

 



50 Section 12.06 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

 

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as
provided in Section 8.03, shall inure only to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in
Section 8.03, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any legal
or equitable rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities
hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each
other party hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or
assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time
to time in part, to one or more of its Affiliates at any time, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void;
_provided_ that such transfer or assignment shall not relieve Parent or
Merger Subsidiary of its obligations under this Agreement, enlarge, alter or
change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or Merger
Subsidiary or prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders to receive
payment for Shares validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 12.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

Section 12.08 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any Action
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any party
or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court or,
if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the
State of Delaware or other Delaware state court (collectively, the
"Delaware Courts"), and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to
the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such Action and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any Action in any such court or that any such Action
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process
in any such Action may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether
within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided
in Section 12.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

Section 12.09 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 

Section 12.10 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the

 



51  signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement
may be executed by facsimile or .pdf signature and a facsimile or .pdf
signature shall constitute an original for all purposes. This Agreement shall
become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart
hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party
has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication).

 

Section 12.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Annexes and
Exhibits hereto), the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, the Tender and Voting Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement.

Section 12.12  _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 12.13 _Specific Performance_.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or were
threatened to be not performed, in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto further agrees that it shall not object to, or
take any position inconsistent with respect to, whether in a court of law or
otherwise, (i) the appropriateness of the specific performance contemplated by
this Section 12.13 and (ii) the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts
with respect to any Action brought for any such remedy, and each party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy. The parties further
agree that (A) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 12.13, a
party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement, including
monetary damages in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in
the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 12.13 are not
available or otherwise are not granted, and (B) nothing contained in this
Section 12.13 shall require any party to institute any proceeding for (or
limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific

 



52  performance under this Section 12.13 before exercising any termination right
under Section 11.01 (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall
the commencement of any Action pursuant to this Section 12.13 or anything
contained in this Section 12.13 restrict or limit any partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Section 11.01 or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

(c) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably (i) generally and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts
for any Action brought for any remedy contemplated by this Section 12.13; (ii)
waives any objections which such party may now or hereafter have to the laying
of venue of any such Action and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees
not to plead or claim that any such Action has been brought in an inconvenient
forum; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat the personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts by motion or other request for leave from
any such court; (iv) agrees that it will not bring any Action for any remedy
contemplated by this Section 12.13 in any court other than the Delaware
Courts; (v) agrees that service of all process, including the summons and
complaint, in any Action may be made by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, to such party at their respective addresses provided in
accordance with Section 12.01 or in any other manner permitted by Applicable
Law; and (vi) agrees that service as provided in the preceding clause (v) is
sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over such party in the Action, and
otherwise constitutes effective and binding service in every respect. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any Action in a Delaware
Court may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Applicable Law, and each party further agrees to
the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts for the enforcement or
execution of any such judgment.

(d) To the extent either party hereto brings any Action to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and
any other agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith in
accordance with this Section 12.13, the End Date shall automatically be
extended by (i) the amount of time during which such Action is pending, plus
20 Business Days, or (ii) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such Action.
