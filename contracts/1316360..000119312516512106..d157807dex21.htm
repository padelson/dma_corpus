stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into the Company Common Stock or Parent Common Shares, as
applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,

of the Company Common Stock or Parent Common Shares issued and outstanding
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(d) _Treatment of the Company Equity Awards_.

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into a Parent restricted share unit award on the terms and
conditions (including any continuing vesting requirements) under the
applicable plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, with respect to a number of Parent Common Shares, with the
aggregate number of Parent restricted share units with respect to such Parent
Common Shares held by each holder rounded up to the nearest whole unit,
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio.

 



5 (ii) Each Company PSU Award, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into a Parent restricted share unit award on the terms
and conditions (including any continuing vesting requirements) under the
applicable plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, with respect to a number of Parent Common Shares, with the
aggregate number of Parent restricted share units with respect to such Parent
Common Shares held by each holder rounded up to the nearest whole unit,
determined by multiplying the number (A) of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (B) the Exchange Ratio, provided that, except as set forth on Section
3.1(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each unvested Company PSU Award
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
Parent restricted share units vesting on the February 1 following the
expiration of the applicable performance period under the Company PSU Award,
with respect to a number of Parent Common Shares, with the aggregate number of
Parent restricted share units with respect to such Parent Common Shares held
by each holder rounded up to the nearest whole unit, determined based on the
percentages set forth on Section 3.1(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
under the terms of the Company PSU Award and multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio.

(iii) Each Company DSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a Parent deferred
share unit award on the terms and conditions under the applicable plan and
award agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, with
respect to a number of Parent Common Shares, with the aggregate number of
Parent deferred share units with respect to such Parent Common Shares held by
each holder rounded up to the nearest whole unit, determined by multiplying
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company DSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio.

 

(iv) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume (A) the Company
RSU Awards, Company PSU Awards and Company DSU Awards that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Equity
Awards_ ") in accordance with the terms of this _Section 3.1(d)_ and (B)
sponsorship of each Company Equity Plan, provided that references to the
Company therein shall thereupon be deemed references to Parent and references
to Company Common Stock therein shall be deemed references to Parent Common
Shares with appropriate equitable adjustments to reflect the Transactions.

(v) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company or the
appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing for the
treatment of the Company Equity Awards and the Company Equity Plans as
contemplated by this _Section 3.1(d)_.

 

(vi) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate form) registering a number of Parent Common Shares necessary to
fulfill Parents obligations under this _Section 3.1(d)_. Parent shall take
all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
Parent Common Shares for delivery with respect to the Company Equity Awards
assumed by it in accordance with this _Section 3.1(d)_.

 



6 (e) _No Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. In accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Company Common
Stock in connection with the Merger.

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
designate a bank, trust company or nationally recognized stockholder services
provider (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging, in
accordance with this _Article III_ , Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for
the Merger Consideration. In addition, at or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock evidence of
Parent Common Shares representing the aggregate amount of Parent Common
Shares sufficient to deliver the Merger Consideration (such shares, together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, hereinafter, the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration
to be issued pursuant to _Section 3.1_ out of the Exchange Fund.

(b)  _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (a " _Book-Entry Share_
") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock, whose shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that
number of whole Parent Common Shares and/or cash, as applicable, that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
III_ , and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered
in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a
condition to the registration of such Merger Consideration that the
surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of such registration in the name of

 



7  a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 3.2_ , each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue for the benefit of holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to any Parent Common Shares
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_ , in each case until the
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this
_Article III_. Subject to the effect of Applicable Laws, following surrender
of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the
holder of Parent Common Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest,
(i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Parent Common Shares to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_ __ and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such Parent Common Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such Parent Common
Shares.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Parent Common
Shares issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to
have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock, theretofore represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_ , except as
otherwise provided by Applicable Law.

(e) _Fractional Shares_.

 

(i) No certificates representing fractional Parent Common Shares shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Common Shares
(after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to

 



8  such fraction as determined below. As promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the
number of full Parent Common Shares delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent
for issuance to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares over (ii) the
aggregate number of full Parent Common Shares to be distributed to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (such excess being herein referred to as
the " _Excess Shares_ "). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent, as agent for such holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the
Exchange, all in the manner provided herein.

(iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed
on the Exchange and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable.
Until the net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been distributed to the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold
such proceeds in trust for such holders. The net proceeds of any such sale or
sales of Excess Shares to be distributed to the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be reduced by any and all commissions, transfer
taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, as well as any expenses, of
the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale or sales. The
Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled, if any, by
multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which
such holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares is entitled (after taking
into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares then held by such holder)
and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share
interests to which all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
are entitled. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with
respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly
pay such amounts to such holders subject to and in accordance with this
_Section 3.2(e)_.

(f) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_ that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter be entitled to look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for any Parent Common Shares, any cash in
lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares and any dividends or distributions
with respect to Parent Common Shares.

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to seven years
after the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any Parent Common Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares
or any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares in
respect of such

 



9  Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free
and clear of all claims or interests of any person previously entitled
thereto.

 

(h) _Investment of Merger Consideration_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, provided, that no
losses on such investments shall affect the cash payable to former holders of
shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to this _Article III_. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental
Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of the Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in
lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares, and unpaid dividends and
distributions on Parent Common Shares deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant
to this Agreement.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

 

Section 4.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set
forth in any Company SEC Document filed and publicly available prior to the
date of this Agreement (as amended to the date of this Agreement, the "
_Company Filed SEC Documents_ ") and filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since January 1, 2014 (excluding any disclosures
in any risk factors section, in any section related to forward-looking
statements and other disclosures that are predictive or forward-looking in
nature) or as disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company
to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ ") and making reference to the particular subsection of this Agreement
to which exception is being taken (provided, that such disclosure shall be
deemed to qualify that particular subsection and such other subsections of
this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of
such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other
subsections), the Company represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of the Company and
its subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which
recognize such concept) under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
organized and has the requisite corporate or other power, as the case may be,
and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted, except, as to
subsidiaries, for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized,
existing or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each
of the Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions
which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has delivered to or made
available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement true and complete
copies of any amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company
(the " _Company Certificate of Incorporation_ ") and the Bylaws of the Company
not filed as of the date of this Agreement with the Company Filed SEC
Documents.

(b) _Corporate Authority; Non-contravention_.

 

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to the Company Stockholder Approval, to
consummate the Transactions, including the Merger. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company, subject (in the case of the Merger) to the
Company Stockholder Approval and the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the state of Delaware. The Board of Directors of
the Company (at a meeting duly called and held) has, by the unanimous vote of
all directors of the Company: (a) determined that entering this Agreement and
consummating the Transactions, including the Merger, are advisable and fair
to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders; (b)
authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company and approved the Merger; and (c) recommended the
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of the Company Common Stock and
directed that this Agreement be submitted for consideration by the Companys
stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and, subject to _Section
5.2(b)_ , such resolutions have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn in
any way. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Parent, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
that (A) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
examinership, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors rights

 



11  generally and (B) equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive
and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and
to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be
brought (collectively, the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the provisions of
this Agreement shall not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give
rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation
or loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any pledge, claim,
lien, charge, encumbrance or security interest of any kind or nature
whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ ") upon any of the properties or assets of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, under (A) the Company Certificate of
Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company or the comparable organizational
documents of any of its subsidiaries, (B) any loan or credit agreement, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, trust document, lease or other agreement,
instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license or similar authorization to
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the
Company, any of its subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets may
be bound or (C) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred
to in clause (iii) below, any judgment, order, decree, statute, law,
ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case
of clauses (B) and (C), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights,
losses, restrictions or Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to (1) have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or (2) prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of
the Transactions.

(iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by or in respect
of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any federal, state, local,
foreign or supranational government, any court, administrative, regulatory or
other governmental agency, commission or authority or any non-governmental

is required by or with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or
the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, except for (A)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _HSR Act_ "), and with any other applicable

the purpose or effect of monopolization, lessening of competition
or restraint of trade (together with the HSR Act, the " _Antitrust Laws_ ");
(B) the filing with the SEC of (x) a proxy statement relating to the Company
Stockholders Meeting (as defined in _Section 6.1(b)_ ) (such proxy

time, the " _Joint Proxy Statement_ "), (y) the registration statement
on Form F-4 to be filed with the SEC by Parent in connection with the Parent

authorities of other states in which the Company and Parent or their
respective subsidiaries are qualified to do business; (D) such filings with

be issued in the Merger to be listed on the Exchange; and (E) such other
consents, approvals, orders or authorizations the failure of which to be made
or obtained, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to (1) have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or (2) prevent
or materially delay the consummation of any of the Transactions.

 

(c) _Capital Structure_.

 

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 160,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 1,600,000 shares of preferred stock, without par

(iii) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings
to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party with respect to
the voting of the capital stock or other equity interest of the Company or its
subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has granted any

registration rights or similar rights with respect to its shares of capital
stock that are in effect.

 

(d) _Subsidiaries_.

 

(i) The subsidiaries set forth on Section 4.1(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Letter are the only Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Rule 1-02 of
Regulation S-X of the SEC) of the Company. All outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, each such Significant Subsidiary (as
defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC) have been validly issued

the Company, free and clear of any Liens and free of any other restriction,
including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of

ownership interests in, any subsidiary of the Company or (C) obligations of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any such outstanding securities of subsidiaries of the Company or
to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any such
securities.

(e) _SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

(i) The Company and its subsidiaries have filed or furnished all required
registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements,
certifications and other documents (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated therein) with the SEC since December 1, 2012 (the "
_Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, the Company SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ "), as the case may be, and the rules and

 



14  regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company SEC
Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents when filed and at their
respective effective times, if applicable, contained any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from
the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Documents is the subject of
any outstanding SEC comment or outstanding SEC investigation.

(ii) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company and its subsidiaries included in the Company SEC
Documents (the " _Company Financial Statements_ ") were prepared in all
material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
(" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the
SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which are
not material and to any other adjustments described therein, including the
notes thereto).

 

(iii) Except (A) as reflected or reserved against in the Companys audited
balance sheet as of November 30, 2015 (or the notes thereto) as included in
the Company Filed SEC Documents, (B) for liabilities and obligations incurred
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since
November 30, 2015 and (C) for liabilities and obligations incurred
in connection with or contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required by
GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto) that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

(iv) the Company maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Companys properties or assets. Since December 1, 2012, none of the Company,
the Companys independent accountants, the Board of Directors of the Company
or its audit committee has received any oral or written notification of any
(i) "significant deficiency" in the internal controls over
financial reporting of the Company, (ii) "material weakness" in

 



15  the internal controls over financial reporting of the Company or (iii)
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees of

Section 4.2 _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_. Except
as set forth in any Parent SEC Document filed and publicly available prior to
the date of this Agreement (as amended to the date of this Agreement, the "
_Parent Filed SEC Documents_ ") and filed with the SEC since June 19, 2014
(excluding any disclosures in any risk factors section, in any section
related to forward-looking statements and other disclosures that are
predictive or forward-looking in nature) or as disclosed in the disclosure
letter delivered by Parent to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement
(the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") and making reference to the particular
subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being taken (provided, that
such disclosure shall be deemed to qualify that particular subsection and such
other subsections of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies
or applies to such other subsections), Parent and Merger Sub jointly and
severally represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the other subsidiaries of Parent is a corporation or other legal entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under the laws of the jurisdiction
in which it is organized and has the requisite corporate or other power, as
the case may be, and authority to carry on its business as now being
conducted, except, as to subsidiaries, for those jurisdictions where the
failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the other subsidiaries of
Parent is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent
has delivered to or made available to the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement true and complete copies of any amendments to its Certificate of
Incorporation, Memorandum of Association (the " _Parent Memorandum of
Association_ ") and Bye-laws (the " _Parent Bye-laws_ ") not filed as of the
date of this Agreement with the Parent Filed SEC Documents.

 



28 (b) _Corporate Authority; Non-contravention_.

 

(i) Parent and Merger Sub have all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and, subject (in the case of the issuance of Parent
Common Shares in the Merger (the " _Parent Share Issuance_ "), the name change
of "Markit Ltd." to "IHS Markit Ltd." (the " _Parent Name Change_ ") and the
Parent Amended Bye-laws) to the Parent Shareholder Approvals and (in the case
of Merger Sub) to the adoption of this Agreement by Merger Subs sole
shareholder (which adoption shall occur immediately after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement), to consummate the Transactions, including the
Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub
and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
Parent and Merger Sub, subject (in the case of the Parent Share Issuance, the
Parent Name Change and the Parent Amended Bye-laws) to the Parent Shareholder
Approvals and (in the case of Merger Sub) to the adoption of this Agreement
by Merger Subs sole shareholder (which adoption shall occur immediately after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement) and the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the state of Delaware.
The Board of Directors of Parent (at a meeting duly called and held) has, by
the unanimous vote of all directors of Parent: (a) determined that entering
this Agreement and consummating the Transactions, including the Parent Share
Issuance, the Parent Name Change and the Parent Amended Bye-laws, are
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and its
shareholders; (b) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Parent and approved the Parent Share
Issuance, the Parent Name Change and the Parent Amended Bye-laws; and (c)
recommended that the shareholders of Parent vote in favor of the approval of
the Parent Share Issuance, the Parent Name Change and the Parent Amended Bye-
laws, and, subject to _Section 5.3(b)_ , such resolutions have not been
rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company,
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except
for the Enforceability Exceptions. 

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do
not, and the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement shall not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
of any obligation or loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, under (A) the Parent Memorandum of Association or the Parent
Bye-laws or the comparable organizational documents of any of its
subsidiaries, (B) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, trust document, lease or other agreement, instrument, permit,
concession, franchise, license or similar authorization to which Parent or
any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent, any of its subsidiaries
or their respective properties or assets may be bound or (C) subject to the
governmental filings and other matters referred to in 

 



29  clause (iii) below, any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance,
rule or regulation applicable to Parent or any of its subsidiaries or their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (B) and
(C), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, losses, restrictions or
Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to (1) have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or (2) prevent or materially
delay the consummation of any of the Transactions.

(iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by or in
respect of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental
Entity is required by or with respect to Parent, Merger Sub or any other
subsidiaries of Parent in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent or the consummation by Parent of the Transactions, except

the filing with the SEC of (x) a proxy statement relating to the Parent
Shareholders Meeting (as defined in _Section 6.1(c)_ ), (y) the Form F-4 and

states in which Parent and the Company or their respective subsidiaries are
qualified to do business; (D) such filings with and approvals of the Exchange
to permit the Parent Common Shares that are to be issued in the Merger to be
listed on the Exchange; and (E) such other consents, approvals, orders or
authorizations the failure of which to be made or obtained, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (1) have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent or (2) prevent or materially delay the consummation
of any of the Transactions.

(i) The authorized share capital of Parent consists of 3,000,000,000 Parent

30 (ii) All issued and outstanding shares of Parent are, and all shares of
Parent that may be issued as permitted by this Agreement or otherwise shall
be, when issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and not subject to preemptive rights. Except as set forth in this _Section

of Parent (including any subsidiary trust), or obligations of Parent,

Regulation S-X of the SEC) of Parent. All outstanding shares of capital stock
of, or other equity interests in, each such Significant Subsidiary (as defined
in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC) have been validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by Parent,
free and clear of any Liens and free of any other restriction, including any
restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such

31  its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such
outstanding securities of subsidiaries of Parent or to issue, deliver or sell,
or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any such securities.

(e) _SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(i) Parent and its subsidiaries have filed or furnished all required
registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements,
certifications and other documents (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated therein) with the SEC since June 19, 2014 (the "
_Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, the Parent SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable
to the Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents when filed
and at their respective effective times, if applicable, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in

received from the SEC with respect to any of the Parent SEC Documents, and,
to the knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Documents is the subject of
any outstanding SEC comment or outstanding SEC investigation.

 

(ii) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of Parent and its subsidiaries included in the Parent SEC
Documents (the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ") were prepared in all
material respects in accordance with the International Financial Reporting
Standards (" _IFRS_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and
its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments which are not material and to any other adjustments described

ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December 31,
2015 and (C) for liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with or
contemplated by this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would be required by IFRS to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its subsidiaries (or in the notes
thereto) that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 



32 (iv) Parent maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
IFRS, consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Parents properties or assets. Since January 1, 2013, none of Parent,
Parents independent accountants, the Board of Directors of Parent or its
audit committee has received any oral or written notification of any (i)
"significant deficiency" in the internal controls over financial reporting of
Parent, (ii) "material weakness" in the internal controls over financial
reporting of Parent or (iii) fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees of Parent who have a significant role in the
internal controls over financial reporting of Parent.

(v) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Parent are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Parent, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of Parent to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(vi) Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of
its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of
its subsidiaries in Parents or such subsidiarys published financial
statements or other Parent SEC Documents.

(f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the Form F-4 will, at the time the Form F-4 is filed with the
SEC, and at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or (ii) the Joint
Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to Parents shareholders
or at the time of the Parent Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order

 



33  to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. The Form F-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement
shall comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder,
except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Form F-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

 

(g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(i) From December 31, 2015, through the date of this Agreement, other than
with respect to the Transactions, the businesses of Parent and its
subsidiaries have been conducted in all material respects in the ordinary
course of business in a manner consistent with past practice.

 

(ii) Since December 31, 2015, there have been no Effects that, individually or

would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Parent, Merger Sub and the other subsidiaries of Parent are in compliance with
the terms of the Parent Permits and all Applicable Laws relating to
Parent, Merger Sub and the other subsidiaries of Parent or their respective
businesses or properties, except where the failure to be in compliance with

Parent, threatened in writing against or affecting Parent, Merger Sub or any

Governmental Entity except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to (A) have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or (B)
prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the Transactions.

subsidiary of Parent have in all material respects performed all obligations
required to be performed by them to date under each Parent Material Contract,

notice or both would result in such a violation or default under) any

documents governing or relating to indebtedness with respect to any financing
matters concerning the Company, Parent and the Transactions.

(ii) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the limitation set forth in _Section 5.1_ , it may be

(including, without limitation, the raising of new financing, the refinancing
of existing indebtedness, the retirement, prepayment or redemption of existing
indebtedness and/or producing amendments, amendment and restatements,
modifications, waivers or consents in relating to existing indebtedness) (any
such financing transaction, a " _Pre-Merger Financing Transaction_ "). In
connection with any Pre-Merger Financing Transaction, the parties hereto
shall, and shall cause their subsidiaries and their respective officers, 

 



50  directors, employees, accountants, consultants, investment bankers, legal
counsel, agents, financial advisors and other advisors and representatives to
cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to provide such information
and documentation to each other as may be necessary or reasonably desirable in
connection with the structuring, marketing and execution of any Pre-Merger
Financing Transaction, including (A) participating in meetings and due
diligence sessions and rating agency presentations in connection with the Pre-

respect to any Pre-Merger Financing Transaction). Neither party shall enter
into any Pre-Merger Financing Transaction, or incur any fees and expenses in
connection with any Pre-Merger Financing Transaction that would be subject to
reimbursement under _Section 6.5_ , without the other partys prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld); provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt, consent shall not be required for (x) any inter-company indebtedness
solely involving Parent and/or direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of
Parent or solely involving the Company and/or direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries of the Company and (y) any other action permitted by _Section

neither the Company nor Parent shall be required to (x) enter into any Pre-
Merger Financing Transaction that is not conditioned upon the consummation of
the Merger or (y) disclose any information pursuant to this _Section 5.1(d)_
to the extent that (A) in the reasonable good faith judgment of such party,
any Applicable Law requires such party or its subsidiaries to restrict or
prohibit access to any such information, (B) in the reasonable good faith
judgment of such party, the information is subject to confidentiality
obligations to a third party or (C) disclosure of any such information or
document would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege; provided,
further, that with respect to clauses (A) through (C) of this _Section 5.1(d)_
, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (1) obtain the required consent of any third party necessary to
provide such disclosure, (2) develop an alternative to providing such
information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to the
Company and Parent and (3) in the case of clauses (A) through (C), utilize
the procedures of a joint defense agreement or implement such other
techniques if the parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the
disclosure of such information without violating Applicable Law or
jeopardizing such privilege.

 



51 Section 5.2 _No Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) The Company shall not, shall not authorize or permit any of its controlled
affiliates or any of its or their officers, directors or employees to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative (a "
_Representative_ ") retained by it or any of its controlled affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information), or knowingly
take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the
making of, any proposal the consummation of which would constitute a Company
Alternative Transaction or (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations, or cooperate in any way with any person (or group of persons),
with respect to any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the
consummation of which would constitute a Company Alternative Transaction,
except to notify such person (or group of persons) as to the existence of the
provisions of this _Section 5.2_ ; provided, however, that if, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that any
such proposal that did not result from a material breach of this _Section
5.2(a)_ constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Superior Proposal, subject to compliance with _Section 5.2(c)_ , the Company
and its Representatives may (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and its subsidiaries to the person (or group of persons) making such
proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources) (provided that all
such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to
Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to
such person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing
terms as to confidentiality (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not include any "standstill" terms) generally no less
restrictive than the terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated December
24, 2015, as amended, entered into between the Company and Parent (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such proposal with the person (or group of persons)
making such proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources).
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Alternative Transaction_ " means
any of (i) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any
person (or group of persons) other than Parent and its subsidiaries (including
Merger Sub) (such person (or group of persons), a " _Company Third Party_ "),
acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than 20% of the issued
and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or securities (or options,
rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for, such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of the
Company, whether from the Company or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange
offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar
transaction pursuant to which any Company Third Party acquires or would
acquire, directly or indirectly, assets or businesses of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the revenues, net income or
assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any
Company Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly,
control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity
securities of subsidiaries of the Company and any entity surviving any merger
or combination including any of them) of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets
(in each case on a consolidated basis) of the Company and its subsidiaries
taken as a whole or (iv) any disposition of assets to a Company Third
Party representing 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each
case on a consolidated basis) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

 



52 (b) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.2(b)_ , neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, or fail
to make, in each case in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or
recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of the Merger or
this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Company Alternative Transaction (any action in clause (i) or
this clause (ii) being referred to as a " _Company Recommendation Change_ "),
provided, that nothing herein shall restrict or otherwise limit the Company
from making accurate disclosure to its stockholders of factual information
regarding the business, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company or, so long as the Company provides Parent with reasonable advance
notice and a copy of the proposed disclosure, the fact that a proposal the
consummation of which would constitute a Company Alternative Transaction has
been made, the identity of the party making such proposal or the material
terms of such proposal (and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a
Company Recommendation Change), so long as the disclosure through which such
factual information is conveyed, taken as a whole, is not contrary to or
materially inconsistent with the recommendation made by the Board of Directors
of the Company or (iii) cause the Company or any of its controlled affiliates
to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other agreement related to any Company Alternative Transaction or
requiring, or reasonably likely to cause, the Company to terminate, delay or
fail to consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere with or be
inconsistent with, the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in _Section 5.3(a)_ ). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after it has
received a Company Superior Proposal (and after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of the Company may (subject to this and
the following sentences) effect a Company Recommendation Change, but only at
a time that is after the fourth business day following Parents receipt of
written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of
the Company has received a Company Superior Proposal specifying the material
terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal, identifying the person
making such Company Superior Proposal and stating that it intends to make a
Company Recommendation Change; provided that in the event of a subsequent
modification to the material terms and conditions of such Company Superior
Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may only effect a Company
Recommendation Change after the later of (x) the fourth business day
following Parents receipt of the initial written notice advising Parent of
the Company Superior Proposal and (y) the second business day following
Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent of the
modification to such terms and conditions; and provided further that during
such four or two business day notice period, as applicable, the Company
engages (to the extent requested by Parent) in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the proposal to enter
into a Company Alternative Transaction no longer constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Company Superior
Proposal_ " means any bona fide written proposal (on its most
recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a Company
Third Party to enter into a

 



53  Company Alternative Transaction (with all references to 20% in the
definition of Company Alternative Transaction being treated as references to
50% for these purposes) that (A) did not result from a material breach of
_Section 5.2(a)_ , (B) is on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be superior from a
financial point of view to the Companys stockholders than the Transactions,
taking into account all relevant factors (including any changes to this
Agreement that may be proposed by Parent in response to such proposal to enter
into a Company Alternative Transaction and the identity of the person making
such proposal to enter into a Company Alternative Transaction), and (C) is
reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
5.2(a)_ and _Section _ _5.2(b)_ , the Company shall promptly, and in any
event within 24 hours of receipt thereof, advise Parent orally and in writing
of any request for information or of any proposal relating to a Company
Alternative Transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request or
proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making
such request or proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status and details (including amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such request or proposal on a current basis and (ii)
provide to Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery
thereof copies of all correspondence and other written materials
exchanged between the Company or its subsidiaries or any of their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any person making such request or
proposal, on the other hand, in each case that describes in any material
respect any of the material terms or conditions of any such request or
proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" statement or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of
its position thereunder; provided, however, that any such disclosure or
statement that constitutes or contains a Company Recommendation Change shall
be subject to the provisions of _Section 5.2(b)_.

 

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation by Parent_.

 

(a) Parent shall not, shall not authorize or permit any of its controlled
affiliates or any of its or their officers, directors or employees to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Representatives retained by
it or any of its controlled affiliates not to, directly or indirectly through
another person, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way
of furnishing information), or knowingly take any other action designed to
facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the
consummation of which would constitute a Parent Alternative Transaction or
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations, or cooperate in any way
with any person (or group of persons), with respect to any inquiries
regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which would
constitute a Parent Alternative Transaction, except to notify such person (or
group of persons) as to the existence of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_
; provided, however, that if, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent
Shareholder Approvals, the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized

 



54  reputation) that any such proposal that did not result from a material
breach of this _Section 5.3(a)_ constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Parent Superior Proposal, subject to compliance with _Section
5.3(c)_ , Parent and its Representatives may (A) furnish information with
respect to Parent and its subsidiaries to the person (or group of persons)
making such proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources)
(provided that all such information has previously been provided to the
Company or is provided to the Company prior to or substantially concurrent
with the time it is provided to such person) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement containing terms as to confidentiality (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement need not include any
"standstill" terms) generally no less restrictive than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such proposal with the person (or group of persons) making such
proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources). For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Parent Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (i) a
transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any person (or group
of persons) other than the Company and its subsidiaries (such persons (or
group of persons), a " _Parent Third Party_ "), acquires or would acquire,
directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under
the Exchange Act) of more than 20% of the issued and outstanding Parent Common
Shares or securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing
20% or more of the voting power of Parent, whether from Parent or pursuant to
a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, consolidation,
share exchange or similar transaction pursuant to which any Parent Third Party
acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, assets or businesses of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the revenues,
net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Parent and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any
Parent Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, control
of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of
subsidiaries of Parent and any entity surviving any merger or combination
including any of them) of Parent or any of its subsidiaries representing 20%
or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated
basis) of Parent and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (iv) any disposition
of assets to a Parent Third Party representing 20% or more of the revenues,
net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Parent and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.3(b)_ , neither the Board
of Directors of Parent nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify
or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, or fail to
make, in each case in a manner adverse to the Company, the approval or
recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of the Parent
Share Issuance, the Parent Name Change or the Parent Amended Bye-laws or this
Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Parent Alternative Transaction (any action in clause (i) or
this clause (ii) being referred to as a " _Parent Recommendation Change_ "),
provided, that nothing herein shall restrict or otherwise limit Parent from
making accurate disclosure to its shareholders of factual information
regarding the business, financial condition or results of operations of Parent
or, so long as Parent provides the Company with reasonable advance notice and
a copy of the proposed disclosure, the fact that a proposal the consummation
of which would constitute a Parent Alternative Transaction has been made, the
identity of the party making such proposal or the material terms of such
proposal (and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Parent
Recommendation Change), so long as the disclosure through which such factual
information is conveyed, taken as a whole, is not contrary

 



55  to or materially inconsistent with the recommendation made by the Board of
Directors of Parent or (iii) cause Parent or any of its controlled affiliates
to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other agreement related to any Parent Alternative Transaction or
requiring, or reasonably likely to cause, Parent to terminate, delay or fail
to consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere with or be
inconsistent with, the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in _Section 5.3(a)_ ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that prior to obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approvals, the Board
of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after it has received a
Parent Superior Proposal (and after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do
so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of Parent may (subject to this
and the following sentences) effect a Parent Recommendation Change, but only
at a time that is after the fourth business day following the Companys
receipt of written notice from Parent advising the Company that the Board of
Directors of Parent has received a Parent Superior Proposal specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Parent Superior Proposal, identifying
the person making such Parent Superior Proposal and stating that it intends to
make a Parent Recommendation Change; provided that in the event of a
subsequent modification to the material terms and conditions of such Parent
Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of Parent may only effect a Parent
Recommendation Change after the later of (x) the fourth business day following
the Companys receipt of the initial written notice advising the Company of
the Parent Superior Proposal and (y) the second business day following the
Companys receipt of written notice from Parent advising the Company of the
modification to such terms and conditions; and provided further that during
such four or two business day notice period, as applicable, Parent engages (to
the extent requested by the Company) in good faith negotiations with the
Company to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the proposal to enter
into a Parent Alternative Transaction no longer constitutes a Parent Superior
Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Parent Superior Proposal_ "
means any bona fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or
modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a Parent Third Party to enter
into a Parent Alternative Transaction (with all references to 20% in the
definition of Parent Alternative Transaction being treated as references
to 50% for these purposes) that (A) did not result from a material breach of
_Section 5.3(a)_ , (B) is on terms that the Board of Directors of Parent
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be superior from a
financial point of view to Parents shareholders than the Transactions, taking
into account all relevant factors (including any changes to this Agreement
that may be proposed by the Company in response to such proposal to enter
into a Parent Alternative Transaction and the identity of the person making
such proposal to enter into a Parent Alternative Transaction) and (C) is
reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in  _Sections_ _ _
_5.3(a)_ and _5.3(b)_ , Parent shall promptly, and in any event within 24
hours of receipt thereof, advise the Company orally and in writing of any
request for information or of any proposal relating to a Parent Alternative
Transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal
(including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making such
request or proposal. Parent shall (i) keep the Company reasonably informed of
the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any
such request or proposal on a current basis and (ii)

 



56  provide to the Company as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or
delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written materials
exchanged between Parent or its subsidiaries or any of their Representatives,
on the one hand, and any person making such request or proposal, on the other
hand, in each case that describes in any material respect any of the material
terms or conditions of any such request or proposal.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit Parent from taking
and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop,
look and listen" statement or similar communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position
thereunder; provided, however, that any such disclosure or statement that
constitutes or contains a Parent Recommendation Change shall be subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.3(b)_.

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall jointly prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the
Joint Proxy Statement, and Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the

Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the

practicable after such filing. Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party copies of any

to the Joint Proxy Statement received from the SEC. Parent and the Company
shall cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Form F-4 prior to
filing such with the SEC, and with a copy of all such filings made with
the SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no
amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Joint
Proxy Statement or the Form F-4 shall be made without the approval of both
Parent and the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided that with respect to documents filed by a
party that are incorporated by reference in the Form F-4 or Joint Proxy
Statement, this right of approval shall apply only with respect to
information relating to the other party or its business, financial condition
or results of operations, or the combined entity; and provided, further, that
this approval right shall not apply with respect to information relating to a
Company Recommendation Change or a Parent Recommendation Change. The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the Companys stockholders, and Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Parents
shareholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after the Form F-4 is

57  of any stop order, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint
Proxy Statement or the Form F-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to the Company, Parent, or any of
their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to any of the Form F-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company and
shareholders of Parent.

 

(b) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form F-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act, duly give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") in
accordance with the DGCL for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval and shall subject to the provisions of _Section 5.2(b)_ , through
its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders the adoption of this
Agreement. The Company may only postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders
Meeting (i) if necessary to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of a quorum
and (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of
any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company has determined after
consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably likely to be required
under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of the Company prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting; provided, however, that the Company shall postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting up to two (2) times for up to thirty
days each time upon the request of Parent if necessary to solicit additional
proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval.

(c) Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form F-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act, duly give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders (the " _Parent Shareholders Meeting_ ") in
accordance with the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda and the Parent Bye-laws for
the purpose of obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approvals and shall subject
to the provisions of _Section 5.3(b)_ , through its Board of Directors,
recommend to its shareholders the adoption of this Agreement. Parent may only
postpone or adjourn the Parent Shareholders Meeting (i) if necessary to
solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Shareholder
Approvals, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, and (iii) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure that Parent has determined after consultation with outside
legal counsel is reasonably likely to be required under Applicable Law and for
such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
shareholders of Parent prior to the Parent Shareholders Meeting; provided,
however, that Parent shall postpone or adjourn the Parent Shareholders Meeting
up to two (2) times for up to thirty days each time upon the request of the
Company if necessary to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of
obtaining the Parent Shareholders Approvals.

 



58 (d) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Shareholders Meeting on the same
date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.

(e) The only matters to be voted upon at each of the Company Stockholders
Meeting and the Parent Shareholders Meeting are (i) in the case of the
Company, the Merger, (ii) in the case of Parent, the Parent Share Issuance,
the Parent Name Change, and the Parent Amended Bye-laws, (iii) any
adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent
Shareholders Meeting, as applicable, and (iv) any other matters as are

Section 6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and subject to Applicable Law, upon reasonable
notice, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
respective subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the officers,
employees and Representatives of such other party, reasonable access, during
normal business hours during the period from the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time, to all their respective properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records (provided that such access shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of such party), and
during such period, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each
of its respective subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other
party may reasonably request; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
require the Company and Parent to disclose any information pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_ to the extent that (i) in the reasonable good faith judgment of
such party, any Applicable Law requires such party or its Subsidiaries to
restrict or prohibit access to any such information, (ii) in the reasonable
good faith judgment of such party, the information is subject to
confidentiality obligations to a third party or (iii) disclosure of any such
information or document would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege;
provided, further, that with respect to clauses (i) through (iii) of this
_Section 6.2_ , the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (1) obtain the required consent of any
third party necessary to provide such disclosure, (2) develop an alternative
to providing such information so as to address such matters that is
reasonably acceptable to the Company or Parent and (3) in the case of clauses
(i) through (iii), utilize the procedures of a joint defense agreement or
implement such other techniques if the parties determine that doing so would
reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without violating
Applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege. No review pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_ shall affect any representation or warranty given by the other
party hereto. Each of the Company and Parent shall hold, and shall cause its
respective affiliates, officers, employees and Representatives to hold, any
nonpublic information in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

Section 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as possible following the
date hereof, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts in (i) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or

 



59  nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities,
including any required action or non-action under the Antitrust Laws (the "
_Required Consents_ ") prior to the Effective Time, and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain a Required Consent from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers, and any necessary or appropriate financing
arrangements, from third parties, (iii) the contesting and defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including
seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court
or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Transactions, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement, (v)
refraining from taking any action that would reasonably be expected to impede,
interfere with, prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger
and (vi) unless there has been a Company Recommendation Change made in
compliance with _Section 5.2(b)_ (in the case of the Companys obligation to
use its reasonable best efforts) or a Parent Recommendation Change made in
compliance with this _Section 5.3(b)_ (in the case of Parents obligation to
use its reasonable its best efforts), obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval and the Parent Shareholder Approvals. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make (i) an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable, (ii) appropriate
filings, if any are required, pursuant to foreign Antitrust Laws as promptly
as practicable and (iii) all other necessary filings with other Governmental
Entities relating to the Merger, and, in each case, to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
formally or informally requested pursuant to the Antitrust Laws or by such
authorities and to use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting periods under the Antitrust Laws and
the receipt of the Required Consents as soon as practicable. The parties agree
that the use of "reasonable best efforts" in this _Section 6.3_ shall include
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, (x) the sale, divestiture or disposition of such
assets or businesses of either party or its Subsidiaries or affiliates and (y)
restrictions, or actions that after the Effective Time would limit the
Companys or Parents or its other subsidiaries or affiliates freedom of
action or operations with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of
its or its subsidiaries businesses, product lines or assets, in each case
(A) as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any suit or proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the Transactions, (B) conditioned
upon the consummation of the Merger and (C) unless such sale, divestiture,
disposition, restriction or action would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the business,
properties, financial condition or results of operations of Parent and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole (a " _Regulatory Material Adverse Effect_ ").

(b) The parties shall jointly develop, and each of the parties shall consult
and cooperate in all respects with one another, and consider in good faith
the views of one another, in connection with the form and content of any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party, hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law prior to
their submission. Each of the parties shall (i) promptly notify the other
party of any communication inquiry or 

 



60  investigation received by that party from, or given by it to, any
Governmental Entity and, subject to Applicable Law, permit the other party to
review in advance any proposed communication to any such Governmental Entity
and incorporate the other partys reasonable comments, (ii) not agree to
participate in any meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Entity in
respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or
the Merger unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the
other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
therein and (iii) promptly furnish the other party with copies of all
correspondence, filings and written communications between them and their
affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and
Representatives, on one hand, and any such Governmental Entity or its
respective staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger in order for such other party to meaningfully consult and participate
in accordance with the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), provided
that materials furnished pursuant to this _Section 6.3(b)_ may be redacted as
necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns.

 

Section 6.4 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is as of the
date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director
or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or who is as of the date
of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time,
serving at the request of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a
director or officer of another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against
all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person or in respect of
any acts or omissions in their capacities as such directors of officers
occurring prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to,
at or after the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Indemnified Parties
are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws of the Company or the
governing or organizational documents of any subsidiary of the Company and any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of this Agreement. In
the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (i) each Indemnified
Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of
any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Corporation or
Parent to the same extent as such Indemnified Parties are entitled to advance
of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the
Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws of the Company or the
governing or organizational documents of any subsidiary of the Company;
provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL, the Company
Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company, and any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of this Agreement, to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification and (ii) Parent

 



61  shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, cooperate in the defense of any
such matter. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and/or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.4_.

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company or any of their subsidiaries or
provide substitute polices for of not less than the existing coverage and
have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time, except that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to pay with respect to such insurance policies (or substitute
insurance policies) of the Company in respect of any one policy year more than
300% of the annual premium payable by the Company for such insurance for the
prior twelve months (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this
_Section 6.4_ it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the
years within such six-year period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Amount, in respect of each policy year within such period; provided that in
lieu of the foregoing, the Company may obtain at or prior to the Effective
Time a six-year "tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in
the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for
an amount that, on an annual basis, does not exceed the Maximum Amount.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.4_ (i) shall survive consummation of the
Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified Parties), his
or her heirs and his or her representatives, and (iii) are in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

Section 6.5 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in this _Section_ _6.5_
and in _Section 8.2_ , all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Merger, this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated,
except that each of the Company and Parent shall bear and pay one-half of the
costs and expenses (other than the fees and expenses of each partys attorneys
and accountants, which shall be borne by the party incurring such expenses)
incurred by the parties hereto in connection with (i) the filing, printing and
mailing of the Form F-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement (including SEC filing
fees), (ii) the filings of the premerger notification and report forms under
the HSR Act and similar laws of other jurisdictions (including filing fees)
and (iii) with the matters contemplated by _Section 5.1(d)_ (including any
commitment fees, consent fees or other similar fees). 

Section 6.6 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent, and Merger Sub shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or Financing
Disclosure or making any

 



62  public statement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions and
shall not issue any such press release or Financing Disclosure or make any
such public statement without the prior consent of the other, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (a) any such press release, Financing Disclosure or public
statement as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange may be issued prior to such consultation if
the party making the release or statement has used its reasonable best efforts
to consult with the other party, (b) the first sentence of this  _Section
6.6 _shall not apply with respect to a Company Recommendation Change (or any
responses thereto) or a Parent Recommendation Change (or any responses
thereto), or the proviso in _Sections_ _5.2(b)(ii)_ and  _5.3(b)(ii)_ (or any
response to a statement made pursuant to _Sections_ _5.2(b)(ii)_ and
_5.3(b)(ii)_ ), (c) the first sentence of this _Section 6.6_ shall not apply
to any disclosure of information concerning this Agreement in connection with
any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement, (d) the first
sentence of this _Section 6.6_ shall not apply in respect of any such content
that has been previously consented to by the other party, or
otherwise exempted from this _Section 6.6_ , to the extent replicated in
whole or in party in any subsequent press release or other announcement, and
(e) the first sentence of this _Section 6.6_ shall not apply to any public
statement regarding the Transactions in response to questions from the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, or to internal
announcements to employees, so long as such statements are not inconsistent
with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made
jointly by the parties and otherwise in compliance with this _Section 6.6_ and
do not reveal material nonpublic information regarding this Agreement or the
Transactions. As used above, "Financing Disclosure" means any reference to,
or information in connection with, the Merger and the Transactions that is

issued, published and/or distributed by the Company, Parent, or Merger Sub in
connection with any financing transaction to be entered into by any of those
parties.

Section 6.7 _Exchange Listing_. The Company and Parent shall use reasonable

regulation is or may become applicable to the Transactions, each of the
parties hereto and its respective Board of Directors shall (i) grant such
approvals and take all such actions as are legally permissible so that
the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and (ii) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any such statute or regulation on the Transactions.

 

Section 6.10 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires,
applications or other

 



63  documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,

recording, registration and other fees or any similar Taxes which become
payable in connection with the Transactions that are required or permitted to
be filed on or before the Effective Time.

 

Section 6.11 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, or shall cause one
of its subsidiaries (including the Company) to honor, all contractual
obligations under the Company Benefit Plans and Parent Benefit Plans
(including, without limitation, and in accordance with the terms thereof, the
arrangements identified on Section 6.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter and
Section 6.11 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable). For all
purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its subsidiaries
(including the Company) providing benefits to any Continuing Employee after
the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), and subject to Applicable Law, each
Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with
the Company, Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, as the case may
be, before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee
was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar Company Benefit Plans or Parent Benefit Plans, as applicable, except
to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits and
except for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to
any Applicable Law: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible
to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans which are
welfare benefit plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces
coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan, as
applicable, in which such Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent or the Company, as
applicable, shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and
Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to
be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(b) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.11_ shall (i) be construed to
establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, contract, policy or arrangement, (ii) limit the ability of the
Company or Parent or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify
or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract,
policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them, (iii) create any third-party beneficiary rights or
obligations in any person (including any Continuing Employee or former
employee) other than the parties to this Agreement or any right to employment
or continued employment or to a particular term or condition of
employment with the Company or Parent or any of their subsidiaries, or any of
their respective

 



64  affiliates, or (iv) limit the right of the Company or Parent (or any of
their subsidiaries) to terminate the employment or service of any employee or
other service provider following the Closing Date at any time and for any or
no reason.

Section 6.12 _Section 16(b)_. The Company and Parent shall each take all such
steps as are reasonably necessary to cause the Transactions and any other
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) or acquisitions of equity securities of Parent (including
derivative securities) in connection herewith by any individual who is a
director or officer of the Company or at the Effective Time will become a
director or officer of Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.13 _Certain Litigation_. Each party shall promptly advise the other
party of any litigation commenced after the date hereof against such party or
any of its directors (in their capacity as such) by any stockholders or
shareholders of such party (on their own behalf or on behalf of such party)
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and shall keep the other
party reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. Such party shall
give the other party the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any such litigation brought by any stockholders or shareholders,
and no such settlement shall be agreed to without the other partys prior
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

Section 6.14 _Obligations of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation_. Parent
shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 6.15 _Director Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent, at or prior to the Effective
Time, resignations, effective upon the Effective Time, executed by each
director of the Company in office immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(i), (iv) or (vi) of _Section 5.1(a)_ and (ii) is not subject to Parents
consent right provided in _Section 5.1(a)_ on the basis that such transaction
involves solely the Company and one or more of its subsidiaries or solely
Companys subsidiaries, or (b) altering any intercompany arrangements or
agreements or the ownership structure among the Company and its wholly-owned

contrary (other than with respect to claims for, or arising out of or in
connection with, a Willful Breach hereof), (i) in the event that any
Termination Fee is paid to a party in accordance with this _Section 8.2_ , the
payment of such Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of such
party, its subsidiaries, stockholders, affiliates, officers, directors,
employees and Representatives against the other party or any of its
Representatives or Affiliates for, and (ii) in no event will the party being
paid any Termination Fee or any other such person seek to recover any other

respect to, in each case of clause (i) and (ii), (A) any loss suffered,
directly or indirectly, as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated, (B) the termination of this Agreement, (C) any liabilities or

72  out of or relating to any breach, termination or failure of or under this

2006/112) and any other tax of a similar nature whether imposed in a member
state of the European Union in substitution for, or levied in addition to,
such tax, or imposed elsewhere (" _VAT_ "). However, if a Taxing Authority
determines that such sum constitutes all or part of the consideration for a
supply made for VAT purposes then: (i) if the sum is determined by a Taxing
Authority to be consideration for a taxable supply in respect of which the
recipient of the sum (or the representative member of the VAT group of which
the recipient of the sum is a member) is liable to account for VAT, to the
extent that such VAT is recoverable by the payor of the sum (or the
representative member of the VAT group of which the payor is a member) by
repayment or credit, the amount of the sum shall be increased to such amount
so that the amount of the sum (including any amount in respect of VAT), less
the amount of such repayment or credit equals the amount of the sum had no
such VAT arisen; for the avoidance of doubt if and to the extent that such
VAT is irrecoverable by the payor (or the representative member of the VAT
group of which the payor is a member) then no additional amount shall to that
extent be paid in respect of such VAT and the sum shall, to that extent, be
VAT inclusive; and (ii) if a Taxing Authority determines that VAT is due from
the payor of the sum (or the representative member of the VAT group of which
the payor is a party) under the reverse charge mechanism, to the extent that
any VAT chargeable on the supply is not recoverable by such payor (or the
representative member of the VAT group of which the payor is a member) by
repayment or credit, the amount of the sum shall be reduced to such amount so
that the aggregate of the sum and such irrecoverable reverse charge VAT
equals the amount of the sum had no such irrecoverable reverse charge VAT
arisen. Such adjusting payment as may be required between the parties to give
effect to this _Section 8.2(h)_ shall be made five Business Days after the
date on which the determination by the Taxing Authority has been communicated
to the party required to make the payment (together with such evidence of it
as it is reasonable in the circumstances to provide and, where _Section
8.2(h)(i)_  applies, together with the provision of a valid VAT invoice) or,
if later (in the case of _Section 8.2(h)(i)_ ) five Business Days after the
VAT is recovered or (in the case of _Section 8.2(h)(ii)_ ) five Business Days
before the VAT is required to be accounted for. The party paying the sum
shall (or shall procure that the representative member of the VAT group of
which such party is a member shall) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
any available repayment or credit in respect of VAT (as referred to in this
_Section 8.2(h)_ ) and for the purposes of this _Section 8.2(h)_ the extent
of such repayment or credit shall be determined by such party, or the relevant
representative member of the VAT group, acting reasonably.

Section 8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with Applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after
the Company Stockholder

 



73  Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approvals; provided, however, that (a)
after any such approval, there may not be, without further approval of the
stockholders of the Company (in the case of the Company Stockholder Approval)
and the shareholders of Parent (in the case of the Parent Shareholder
Approvals), any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the
form of the consideration to be delivered to the holders of Company Common
Stock hereunder or that by law otherwise expressly requires the further
approval of the stockholders of the Company or shareholders of Parent, as the
case may be, and (b) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement
shall be submitted to be approved by the stockholders of the Company or the
shareholders of Parent. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto and duly
approved by the parties respective Boards of Directors or a duly authorized
committee thereof.

Section 8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, a
party hereto may, subject to the proviso of _Section 8.3_ (and for this
purpose treating any waiver referred to below as an amendment), (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other parties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance by the other party with any
of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement or (d) waive the
satisfaction of any of the conditions contained in this Agreement. No
extension or waiver by the Company or Parent shall require the approval of the
stockholders of the Company or the shareholders of Parent, respectively,
unless such approval is required by Applicable Law. Any agreement on the part
of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Any
extension or waiver given in compliance with this _Section 8.4_ or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

of this Agreement in any court referred to in _Section 9.10_ below,
without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach. 

Section 9.10 _Jurisdiction_. In any action between the parties arising out of

America sitting in Delaware, and appellate courts thereof. Service of process,

forth in _Section 9.2_ shall be effective service of process for any such
action.

defined terms contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and

Section 9.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights
under this _Section 9.12_ with respect thereto. Upon a determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

the Act, any preference shares may be issued or converted into shares that (at

instruments evidencing any shares, option rights, securities having

writing in the form, or as near thereto as circumstances admit, of the
following:

respect of the [number] share(s) [number in figures] standing in your name in

[Signature of Secretary] By Order of the Board



   6.2. | If the requirements of such notice are not complied with, any

interest due in respect thereof be forfeited by a resolution of the Board
to that effect, and such share shall thereupon become the property of the
Company and may be disposed of as the Board shall determine. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the disposal may take place by sale,
repurchase, redemption or any other method of disposal permitted by and
consistent with these Bye-laws and the Act. 
---|--- 



   6.3. | A Member whose share or shares have been so forfeited shall,
notwithstanding such forfeiture, be liable to pay to the Company all calls

all interest due thereon and any costs and expenses incurred by the Company
in connection therewith. 
---|--- 



   6.4. | The Board may accept the surrender of any shares which it is in

by mechanical means.

   7.4. | Notwithstanding any provisions of these Bye-laws: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the Board shall, subject always to the Act and any other
applicable laws and regulations and the facilities and requirements of any
relevant system concerned, have power to implement any arrangements it may, in
its absolute discretion, think fit in relation to the evidencing of title to
and transfer of uncertificated shares and to the extent such arrangements are
so implemented, no provision of these Bye-laws shall apply or have effect to
the extent that it is in any respect inconsistent with the holding or
transfer of shares in uncertificated form; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | unless otherwise determined by the Board and as permitted by
the Act and any other applicable laws and regulations, no person shall be
entitled to receive a certificate in respect of any share for so long as the

---|--- 

Transfer of a Share or Shares

 

IHS Markit Ltd. (the "Company")

 

FOR VALUE RECEIVED [amount], I, [name of transferor] hereby sell, assign

 

and transfer unto [transferee] of [address], [number] shares of the Company.

 

DATED this [date]



      |  |

    Signed by: |  | In the presence of: 
   | 
   _   _ |  | _
  _ 
  Transferor |  | Witness 
   | 
   _   _ |  | _
  _ 
  Transferee |  | Witness 
 



   11.4. | Such instrument of transfer shall be signed by or on behalf of
the transferor and transferee, provided that, in the case of a fully paid
share, the Board may accept the instrument signed by or on behalf of
the transferor alone. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of
such share until the same has been registered as having been transferred to
the transferee in the Register of Members. 
---|--- 
 



   11.5. | The Board may refuse to recognise any instrument of transfer
unless it is accompanied by the certificate in respect of the shares to which
it relates and by such other evidence as the Board may reasonably
require showing the right of the transferor to make the transfer. 
---|--- 



   11.6. | The joint holders of any share may transfer such share to one
or more of such joint holders, and the surviving holder or holders of any
share previously held by them jointly with a deceased Member may transfer any
such share to the executors or administrators of such deceased Member. 
---|--- 



   11.7. |

The Board may in its absolute discretion and without assigning any reason
therefor refuse to register the transfer of a share which is not fully
paid up. The Board shall refuse to register a transfer unless all applicable

Bermuda have been obtained. The Board shall have the authority to request from
any Member, and such Member shall provide, such information 

---|---

Insight Marvel Ltd.



 





      |  as the Board may reasonably request for the purpose of
determining whether the transfer of any share requires such consent,
authorisation or permission and whether the same has been obtained. If the
Board refuses to register a transfer of any share, the Secretary shall, within
three months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the Company,
send to the transferor and transferee notice of the refusal. 
---|--- 
 



   12. | Transmission of Registered Shares 
---|--- 



   12.1. | In the case of the death of a Member, the survivor or survivors
where the deceased Member was a joint holder, and the legal personal
representatives of the deceased Member where the deceased Member was a sole
holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any
title to the deceased Members interest in the shares. Nothing herein
contained shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any
liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by such
deceased Member with other persons. Subject to the Act, for the purpose of
this Bye-law 12.1, legal personal representative means the executor or
administrator of a deceased Member or such other person as the Board may, in
its absolute discretion, decide as being properly authorised to deal with the
shares of a deceased Member. 
---|--- 



   12.2. | Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the
death or bankruptcy of any Member may be registered as a Member upon such
evidence as the Board may deem sufficient or may elect to nominate some person
to be registered as a transferee of such share, and in such case, unless the
shares may be transferred pursuant to either Bye-law 11.1 or Bye-law 11.2, the
person becoming entitled shall execute in favour of such nominee an instrument
of transfer in writing in the form, or as near thereto as circumstances
admit, of the following: 
---|---

[name and address of deceased/bankrupt Member] to [number] share(s) standing

deceased/bankrupt Member] instead of being registered myself/ourselves, elect
to have [name of transferee] (the "Transferee") registered as a transferee of
such share(s) and I/we do hereby accordingly transfer the said share(s) to the
Transferee to hold the same unto the Transferee, his or her
executors, administrators and assigns, subject to the conditions on which the
same were held at the time of the execution hereof; and the Transferee does
hereby agree to take the said share(s) subject to the same conditions.

    12.3. | On the presentation of the foregoing materials to the Board,
accompanied by such evidence as the Board may require to prove the title of
the transferor, the transferee shall be registered as a Member.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board shall, in any case, have the same
right to decline or suspend registration as it would have had in the case of a
transfer of the share by that Member before such Members death or bankruptcy,
as the case may be.  
---|--- 



   12.4. | Where two or more persons are registered as joint holders of a
share or shares, then in the event of the death of any joint holder or holders
the remaining joint holder or holders shall be absolutely entitled to

ALTERATION OF SHARE CAPITAL



   13. | Power to Alter Capital 
---|--- 



   13.1. | The Company may if authorised by resolution of the Members
increase, divide, consolidate, subdivide, change the currency denomination of,
diminish or otherwise alter or reduce its authorised share capital in any
manner permitted by the Act. 
---|--- 



   13.2. | Where, on any alteration or reduction of share capital,
fractions of shares or some other difficulty would arise, the Board may deal
with or resolve the same in such manner as it thinks fit. 
---|--- 
 



   14. | Variation of Rights Attaching to Shares 
---|--- 

If, at any time, the share capital is divided into different classes of
shares, the rights attached to any class (unless otherwise provided by the
terms of issue of the shares of that class) may, whether or not the Company is
being wound-up, be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of
three-fourths of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a
resolution passed by a majority of the votes cast at a separate general
meeting of the holders of the shares of the class at which meeting the
necessary quorum shall be two persons at least holding or representing by
proxy one-third of the issued shares of the class. The rights conferred upon
the holders of the shares of any class or series issued with preferred or
other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of
issue of the shares of that class or series, be deemed to be varied by the
creation or issue of further shares ranking _pari passu_ therewith.

 

DIVIDENDS AND CAPITALISATION



   15. | Dividends 
---|--- 



   15.1. | The Board may, subject to these Bye-laws and in accordance with
the Act, declare a dividend to be paid to the Members, in proportion to the
number of shares held by them, and such dividend may be paid in cash or
wholly or partly in specie in which case the Board may fix the value for
distribution in specie of any assets. 
---|--- 
 



11 determining the Members entitled to receive any dividend. 
---|--- 



   15.3. | The Company may pay dividends in proportion to the amount paid
up on each share where a larger amount is paid up on some shares than on
others. 
---|--- 
 



   15.4. | The Board may declare and make such other distributions (in
cash or in specie) to the Members as may be lawfully made out of the assets of
the Company. 
---|--- 
 



   15.5. | No unpaid dividend, distribution or other monies payable by the
Company on or in respect of any share shall bear interest against the Company
unless otherwise provided by the rights attached to such share.  
---|--- 



   16. | Power to Set Aside Profits 
---|--- 

The Board may, before declaring a dividend or distribution, set aside out of
the surplus or profits of the Company, such amount as it thinks proper as a
reserve to be used to meet contingencies, for equalising dividends, securing
equality of distribution or for any other purpose.

 



   17. | Method of Payment 
---|--- 



   17.1. | Any dividend, interest, or other monies payable in cash in
respect of the shares may be paid by such means as the Board shall determine,
including by cheque or draft sent through the post directed to the Member at
such Members address in the Register of Members (in the case of joint
holders of shares, unless directed in writing otherwise by such joint holders,
to the senior joint holder, seniority being determined by the order in which
the names stand in the Register of Members). Every such cheque or draft shall
be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to such
persons as the Member may direct, and payment of the cheque or draft shall be
a good discharge to the Company. Every such cheque or draft shall be sent at
the risk of the person entitled to the money represented thereby. If two or
more persons are registered as joint holders of any shares, any one of them
can give an effectual receipt for any dividend, distributions or other monies
payable in respect of such shares. 
---|--- 



   17.2. | The Board may deduct from any dividend, distribution or other
monies payable to any Member all monies due from such Member to the Company on
account of calls or otherwise in respect of a share which is not fully paid.  
---|--- 



   17.3. | Any dividend, distribution and/or other monies payable in
respect of a share which has remained unclaimed for a period of six years from
the date when it became due for payment shall, if the Board so resolves,
be forfeited and cease to remain owing by the Company. The payment of any
unclaimed dividend, distribution or other monies payable in respect of a share
may (but need not) be paid by the Company into an account separate from the
Companys own account. Such payment shall not constitute the Company a
trustee in respect thereof. 
---|--- 



   17.4. |

The Company shall be entitled to cease sending dividend cheques and drafts by
post or otherwise to a Member if those instruments have been
returned undelivered to, or left uncashed by, that Member on at least two
consecutive occasions or, following one such 

---|--- 
 



12  

Insight Marvel Ltd.



 





      |  occasion, reasonable enquiries have failed to establish the
Members new address. The entitlement conferred on the Company by this Bye-law
in respect of any Member shall cease if the Member claims a dividend or
cashes a dividend cheque or draft. 
---|--- 



   18. | Capitalisation 
---|--- 



   18.1. | The Board may capitalise any amount for the time being standing
to the credit of any of the Companys share premium or other reserve accounts
or to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for
dividend or distribution by applying such amount in paying up unissued shares
to be allotted as fully paid bonus shares pro-rata (except in connection with
the conversion of shares of one class to shares of another class) to the
Members.  
---|--- 



   18.2. | The Board may capitalise any amount for the time being standing
to the credit of a reserve account or amounts otherwise available for dividend
or distribution by applying such amounts in paying up in full, partly or
nil paid shares of those Members who would have been entitled to such amounts
if they were distributed by way of dividend or distribution.
