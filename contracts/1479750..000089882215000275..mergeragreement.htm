Parent Common Stock and each share of the Class B non-voting common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Class B Common Stock_ ")

quotient of (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such
Company Stock Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 1.7(a), each Assumed Option assumed and converted
pursuant to this Section 1.7(a) shall continue to have, and shall be subject
to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Time (a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ " and, together with the Company
Stock Options, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") shall fully vest and shall be

Company under the applicable Company Stock Plans, each outstanding Assumed

the provisions of the applicable Company Stock Plan.

  

(e) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of the Assumed Options in accordance with this Section 1.7(a). As soon as

effective amendment to the Form S-4 or registration statement on Form S-8 (or
any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to Assumed Options.

1.9 _Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the Amended
and Restated Bylaws of Parent (the " _Parent Bylaws_ "), as in effect

ARTICLE II 
  
 EXCHANGE OF SHARES

  

2.1 _Proration._

  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock to be entitled to receive the Cash
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(a) shall be equal to the product
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (i) 0.15 and (ii) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding the shares of Company Common Stock to
be cancelled as provided in Section 1.5(d)) (the " _Cash Conversion Number_
"). All other

  

 

5  

  

shares of Company Common Stock (excluding the shares of Company Common Stock
to be cancelled as provided in Section 1.5(d)) shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration.

  

(b) Promptly (and in any event no later than five (5) business days) after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation
among holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:

  

    

(i)

  |  

If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to
which Cash Elections shall have been made (the " _Cash Election Number_ ")
exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then all Stock Election Shares and all
Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration, and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof will be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that
number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(A) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (B) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of
which is the Cash Election Number (with the Exchange Agent to determine,
consistent with Section 2.1(a), whether fractions of Cash Election Shares
shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holder\'s Cash
Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration; and

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (the
amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Cash Election Number
being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then all Cash
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares shall be
treated in the following manner:

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(A)

  |  

If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-Election
Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each holder
thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in
respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator
of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent
to determine, consistent with Section 2.1(a), whether fractions of Non-
Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of
such holder\'s Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive
the Stock Consideration; or

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(B)

  |  

If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all
Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that
number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,
the

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

 

6  

  

  

    |  

numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the
total number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which is the total
number of Stock Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine,
consistent with Section 2.1(a), whether fractions of Stock Election Shares
shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holder\'s
Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration.

   
---|--- 
  

  

2.2 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and/or
the Stock Consideration in accordance with, and subject to, Sections 1.6 and
2.1 (a " _Holder_ ") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article II, to submit an election in accordance with the
following procedures:

  

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.2 (herein called an " _Election_ ") (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to
which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such
Holder desires to make a Cash Election.

  

(b) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company,
including appropriate and customary transmittal materials in such form as
prepared by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Form of
Election_ "), so as to permit Holders to exercise their right to make an
Election.

  

(c) Parent (i) shall initially make available and mail the Form of Election
not less than twenty (20) business days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline to Holders of record as of the business day prior to such mailing
date, and (ii) following such mailing date, shall use all reasonable efforts
to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any
stockholder who requests such Form of Election prior to the Election Deadline.
The time period between such mailing date and the Election Deadline is
referred to herein as the " _Election Period_ ".

  

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received, during the Election Period, a Form of Election properly
completed and signed (including duly executed transmittal materials included
in the Form of Election) and accompanied by any Old Certificates representing
all certificated shares to which such Form of Election relates or by an
appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Old Certificates, as set
forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national
securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United
States. As used herein, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the parties, "
_Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the
principal office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the date which the
parties shall agree is as near as practicable to two (2) business days
preceding the Closing Date. The Parties shall cooperate to issue a press
release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the
Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) business days before, and at
least five (5) business days prior to, the Election Deadline.

  

 

7  

  

(e) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, change or revoke
his or her Election by written notice to the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form
of Election. If any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares
of Company Common Stock (none of Parent, the Company nor the Exchange Agent
being under any duty to notify any Holder of any such defect), such Election
shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock
covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-
Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made.

  

(f) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, revoke his or her
Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or
her Old Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Old
Certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections
shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of
written notification from the parties that this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with the terms hereof.

  

(g) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Form of Election, Parent,
in the exercise of its reasonable, good faith discretion, shall have the right
to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement,
governing (i) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any
Holder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (ii) the method of
issuance and delivery of New Certificates representing the whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock into which shares of Company Common Stock are
converted in the Merger and (iii) the method of payment of cash for shares of
Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

  

2.3 _Parent to Make Shares Available_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II, (a) New Certificates representing
the aggregate Stock Consideration to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5 and
exchanged pursuant to Section 2.4(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, and (b) cash in an amount sufficient to pay (i) the
aggregate Cash Consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock and
(ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and New Certificates
described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto (after giving effect to Section 6.10),
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent
shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent,
_provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount
of the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Old Certificates. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

  

2.4 _Exchange of Shares._

  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares
of Company Common Stock

  

  

 

8  

  

immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration
pursuant to Article I and that has not theretofore submitted its Old
Certificates with a Form of Election, a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Old Certificates in exchange for the Stock Consideration and/or the Cash
Consideration which such holder shall have become entitled to receive in
accordance with, and subject to, Sections 1.6, 2.1 and 2.2, and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company Common Stock represented
by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been converted into the
right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or
distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.4(b). From and after the
Effective Time and the completion of the allocation procedures set forth in
Section 2.1, upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates
for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
properly completed letter of transmittal or Form of Election, as applicable,
duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate
representing the Stock Consideration to which such holder of Company Common
Stock shall have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject
to, Sections 1.6, 2.1 and 2.2 and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A)
Cash Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the surrendered Old Certificate or Old Certificates in accordance with, and
subject to, Sections 1.6, 2.1 and 2.2, (B) any cash in lieu of fractional
shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
surrendered Old Certificate or Old Certificates pursuant Section 2.4(e) and
(C) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.4(b), and the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on the Cash Consideration or any cash in lieu of fractional
shares payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as
contemplated by Sections 2.2 and 2.4, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
surrender, the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated
by this Section 2.4.

  

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until
the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with
this Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with
this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any
such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable after the Closing Date with respect to the
Stock Consideration which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive (after
giving effect to Section 6.10).

  

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent
in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of

  

  

 

9  

  

Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of
the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
applicable Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and
dividends or distributions that the holder presenting such Old Certificates is
entitled to, as provided in this Article II.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company who
otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash
(rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the
closing-sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market ("
_Nasdaq_ ") as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five (5) full
trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date (the " _Parent Share
Closing Price_ ") by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such
holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5 and
subject to Section 2.1.

  

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of the Company who
have not complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Company Common
Stock that such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in
each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any
other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  

(g) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock,
cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.4 or any
other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement

  

 

10  

  

as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which
the deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

  

(h) If any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Old
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent or Parent, as
applicable, will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

ARTICLE III 
  
  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

  

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this Article III
shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article III
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of this
Article III to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference) from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as
disclosed in any Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof (but
disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

  

3.1 _Corporate Organization._

  

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of North Carolina and is a bank holding
company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
(" _BHC Act_ "). The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or
lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ "
means, with respect to Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, a material

  

  

 

11  

  

adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, results of operations or
financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (
_provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material
Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after
the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ")
or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date
hereof, in laws, rules or regulations (including, without limitation, tax
rates) of general applicability to companies in the industries in which such
party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or
Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national
or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of
terrorism) or in economic or market conditions affecting the financial
services industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its
Subsidiaries, (D) failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings projections or
internal financial forecasts, but not including the underlying causes thereof,
(E) disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
actions expressly required by this Agreement in contemplation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (F) actions or omissions taken pursuant
to the written consent of Parent, in the case of the Company, or the Company,
in the case of Parent; except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B), or (C), to
the extent that the effects of such change are materially disproportionately
adverse to the business, properties, results of operations or financial
condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to
other companies in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries
operate) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word "
_Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any party, means any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, bank or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated with such party for
financial reporting purposes. True and complete copies of the Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Articles_ ")
and the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_
"), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made
available by the Company to Parent.

  

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.
There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of Company to pay
dividends or distributions except under applicable state law or, in the case
of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or
distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit
accounts of each Subsidiary of the Company that is an insured depository
institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "
_FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund (as defined in Section 3(y) of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950, as amended) to the fullest extent
permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in
connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the
termination of such insurance are pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge,
threatened. Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of the Company as of the date
hereof. There is no person whose results of operations, cash flows,

  

 

12  

  

changes in shareholders\' equity or financial position are consolidated in the
financial statements of the Company other than the Company Subsidiaries.

  

3.2 _Capitalization._

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 2,500,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock, without par value, and 10,000,000 shares of
preferred stock of which no shares of preferred stock are issued or
outstanding. As of the date of this Agreement, no shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of the Company are issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding, other than (i) 24,292,349.892 shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding, which number includes 255,297 shares of Company Common
Stock granted in respect of outstanding Company Restricted Stock Awards
(assuming achievement of any applicable performance goals at the maximum
level), and (ii) no shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury, and (iii)
582,610 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise
of outstanding Company Stock Options. All of the issued and outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness that have the right to vote on any matters on which
shareholders of the Company may vote are issued or outstanding. There are no
contractual obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to which
the Company or its Subsidiaries could be required to register shares of
capital stock or other securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries under the
Securities Act. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, no trust preferred or
subordinated debt securities of the Company are issued or outstanding. Other
than the Company Equity Awards issued prior to the date of this Agreement,
there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls,
rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or
agreements obligating the Company to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or any other equity
interests of the Company.

  

(b) There are no voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or other
agreements in effect pursuant to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries has a contractual or other obligation with respect to the voting
or transfer of the Company Common Stock or other equity interests of the
Company.

  

(c) Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all Company Equity Awards outstanding as of the
date hereof, specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis, (i) the name of each
holder of such Company Equity Award, (ii) the number of shares subject to each
such Company Equity Award, (iii) the grant date of each such Company Equity
Award, (iv) the Company Stock Plan under which such Company Equity Award was
granted, (v) the exercise price for each such Company Equity Award that is a
Company Stock Option, and (vi) the expiration date of each such Company Equity
Award that is a Company Stock Option. Other than the Company Equity Awards, no
equity-based awards (including any cash awards where the amount of payment is
determined in whole or in part based on the price of any capital stock of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) are outstanding.

  

 

13  

  

(d) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of
each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges,
charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all
of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to Company
Subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions, as provided under 12
U.S.C. § 55 or any comparable provision of applicable state law) and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. No Company Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of
any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

  

3.3 _Authority; No Violation._

  

(a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.
The Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the Merger, on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the best interests of
the Company and has directed that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby be submitted to the Company\'s shareholders for approval
at a meeting of such shareholders and has adopted a resolution to the
foregoing effect. Except for the approval of this Agreement by the affirmative
vote of holders of Company Common Stock who are entitled to cast at least a
majority of the votes which all holders of Company Common Stock are entitled
to cast on the matter (the " _Requisite Company Vote_ "), and the adoption and
approval of the Bank Merger Agreement by the board of directors of Company
Bank and the Company as its sole shareholder, no other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent) constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting insured depository institutions or the rights of creditors generally
and subject to general principles of equity (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_
")).

  

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i)
violate any provision of the Company Articles or the Company Bylaws or (ii)
assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section 3.4
are duly obtained and/or made, (x) violate any law, statute, code, ordinance,
rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties

of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an event which,
with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under,

accelerate the

  

 

14  

  

performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
respective properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by
which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound,
except (in the case of clause (ii) above) for such violations, conflicts,
breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations or creations
which, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  

3.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (a) the filing of applications,
filings and notices, as applicable, with the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the " _Federal Reserve Board_ ") under the BHC Act and

_SEC_ ") of a joint proxy statement in definitive form relating to the

be included as a prospectus, to be filed with the SEC by Parent in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _S ‑4_") and
declaration of effectiveness of the S‑4, (f) the filing of the Certificates of
Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State pursuant to the DGCL and the North
Carolina Secretary pursuant to the NCBCA and the filing of the Bank Merger
Certificates, (g) the filing of any notices or other filings under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_
") and (h) such filings and approvals as are required to be made or obtained
under the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of various states in connection with
the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement
and the approval of the listing of such Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq, no
consents or approvals of or filings or registrations with any court,
administrative agency or commission or other governmental authority or
instrumentality or SRO (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ ") are necessary in
connection with (A) the execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement or (B) the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Bank Merger). As used in this
Agreement, " _SRO_ " means (i) any "self regulatory organization" as defined
in Section 3(a)(26) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
_Exchange Act_ ") and (ii) any other United States or foreign securities

regulatory approvals and consents will not be received in order to permit
consummation of the Merger and Bank Merger on a timely basis.

  

 

15  

  

3.5 _Reports._

  

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or furnished,
as applicable) all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2013 with (i) any state
regulatory authority, (ii) the SEC, (iii) the Federal Reserve Board, (iv) the
FDIC, (v) the OCC, (vi) any foreign regulatory authority and (vii) any SRO
(clauses (i) - (vii), collectively, " _Regulatory Agencies_ "), including any
report, registration or statement required to be filed (or furnished, as
applicable) pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of the United States,
any state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the
failure to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and
assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except for
examinations of the Company and its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory
Agency in the ordinary course of business, no Regulatory Agency has initiated
or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of the Company,
investigation into the business or operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2013, except where such proceedings or
investigation would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. There is no
unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with
respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be likely to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

  

(b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2013 (the " _Company SEC Reports_ ")
is publicly available. No such Company SEC Report, at the time filed,
furnished or communicated (and, in the case of registration statements and
proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant
meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed or
furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their respective
dates, all Company SEC Reports filed or furnished under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the
date of this Agreement, no executive officer of the Company has failed in any
respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). As of
the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or material
unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC
Reports.

  

3.6 _Financial Statements._

  

(a) The financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Company SEC Reports (including the related
notes, where

  

 

16  

  

applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes
in shareholders\' equity and consolidated financial position of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective
dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-
end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of
their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except,
in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, since January
1, 2013, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements. Dixon Hughes
Goodman LLP has not resigned (or informed the Company that it intends to
resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of the Company as
a result of or in connection with any disagreements with the Company on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015
(including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2015, or
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
the Company by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the
date hereof, to the Company\'s outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Company\'s Board of Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company\'s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (y) to the knowledge
of the Company, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the Company\'s internal
controls over financial reporting. To the knowledge of

  

 

17  

  

the Company, there is no reason to believe that the Company\'s outside
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

  

(d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,
auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the
knowledge of the Company, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of
its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of the Company, to any
director or officer of the Company.

  

3.7 _Broker\'s Fees_. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any
of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or
financial advisor or incurred any liability for any broker\'s fees,
commissions or finder\'s fees in connection with the Merger or related
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than Sandler O\'Neill +
Partners, L.P. and UBS Securities LLC pursuant to letter agreements, true and
complete copies of which have been previously provided to Parent.

  

3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events._

  

(a) Since December 31, 2014, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  

(b) Since December 31, 2014, except with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or as required or permitted by this Agreement, the Company
and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all
material respects in the ordinary course.

  

3.9 _Legal Proceedings._

  

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and
there are no pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental
or regulatory investigations of any nature against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their current or former directors or executive officers
(i) that would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or (ii) reasonably likely
to prevent,

  

 

18  

  

materially impede or materially delay its ability to perform its covenants and
agreements under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  

(b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction imposed upon the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the
Merger, would apply to the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates).

  

3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns._

  

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (taking
into account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all
jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return. All material
Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are due have been fully and
timely paid. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid
all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, shareholder, independent
contractor or other third party. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period
applicable to any material Tax that remains in effect. The federal income Tax
Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all years up to and including
December 31, 2010 have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the "
_IRS_ ") or are Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable period for
assessment under applicable law, after giving effect to extensions or waivers,
has expired. No deficiency with respect to a material amount of Taxes has been
proposed, asserted or assessed, in each case, in writing, against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no pending or threatened in writing
disputes, claims, audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any
material Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. In the last six (6) years, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has been informed in writing by any jurisdiction
that the jurisdiction believes that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was
required to file any Tax Return that was not filed. The Company has made
available to Parent true, correct, and complete copies of any private letter
ruling requests, closing agreements or gain recognition agreements with
respect to Taxes requested or executed in the last six (6) years. There are no
Liens for material Taxes (except Taxes not yet due and payable) on any of the
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation
or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or
arrangement exclusively between or among the Company and its Subsidiaries).
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a

3.11 _Employees and Employee Benefit Plans._

  

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all material Company Benefit Plans. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Company Benefit Plans_ " means all employee benefit plans (as
defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")), whether or not subject to ERISA, and all
stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred
compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement,
retention, bonus, employment, change in control, termination or severance
plans, programs, agreements or arrangements that are maintained, contributed
to or sponsored or maintained by, or required to be contributed to, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of any current or former
employee, officer, director or independent contractor of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

  

(b) The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true and complete
copies of (i) each material Company Benefit Plan, including any amendments
thereto and all related trust documents, insurance contracts or other funding
vehicles, and (ii) to the extent applicable, (A) the most recent summary plan
description, if any, required under ERISA with respect to such Company Benefit
Plan, (B) the most recent annual report (Form 5500), if any, filed with the

for each Company

  

 

20  

  

Benefit Plan (if applicable), and (E) all material correspondence to or from
any Governmental Entity received in the last three years with respect to such
Company Benefit Plan.

  

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of
all applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has, within the prior three (3) years, taken any action to
take corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program
of the IRS, Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect
to any Company Benefit Plan, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan defect that would qualify for
correction under any such program.

  

(d) Section 3.11(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each Company
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
(the " _Company Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has issued a favorable
determination or opinion letter with respect to each Company Qualified Plan
and the related trust, which letter has not been revoked (nor has revocation
been threatened in writing), and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are
no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Company Qualified
Plan or the related trust. No trust funding any Company Benefit Plan is
intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

  

(e) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code: (i) no such
Company Benefit Plan is in "at-risk" status for purposes of Section 430 of the
Code, (ii) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA
for which the thirty (30)-day notice requirement has not been waived has
occurred, (iii) all premiums required to be paid to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ") have been timely paid in full, (iv) no
liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has
been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
and (v) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such Company
Benefit Plan. No Controlled Group Liability with respect to an employee
benefit plan that is not a Company Benefit Plan has been incurred by the
Company or its ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full, and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that presents a material
risk to the Company or its ERISA Affiliates of incurring any such liability.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Controlled Group Liability_ " means any and
all liabilities (i) under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under Section 302 of ERISA,
(iii) under Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, and (iv) as a result of a
failure to comply with the continuing coverage requirements of Section 601 et.
seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code.

  

(f) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years, contributed
to or been obligated to contribute to any plan that is a "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ")
or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are
not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "
_Multiple Employer Plan_ "), and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability to a
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a complete or
partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in Part I

  

 

21  

  

of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan that has not been satisfied in full. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means, with respect to any entity, trade or
business, any other entity, trade or business that is, or was at the relevant
time, a member of a group described in Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA that includes or included the first
entity, trade or business, or that is, or was at the relevant time, a member
of the same "controlled group" as the first entity, trade or business pursuant
to Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA.

  

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or
has any obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for
any post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance
benefits for retired or former employees or beneficiaries or dependents
thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code or similar state law.

  

(h) All contributions required to be made to any Company Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
Company Benefit Plan, for any period in the prior three (3) years through the
date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected on the books and records of the Company, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

(i) There are no pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course of business), lawsuits
or arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to the Company\'s
knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably be expected to
give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Company Benefit Plans, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans
or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans,
that could in any case reasonably be likely to result in any material
liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS, the
Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer Plan, any
participant in a Company Benefit Plan or any other party.

  

(j) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could subject any of
the Company Benefit Plans or their related trusts, the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates to any tax or penalty
imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA, except as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

(k) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery
of, cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to transfer or set aside any
assets to fund any benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, or increase in the
amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any employee,
officer, director or other service provider of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  

 

22  

  

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable
(whether in cash, in property or in the form of benefits) by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions
in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

  

(l) No Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

  

(m) There are no pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened material
labor grievances or unfair labor practice claims or charges against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor
disputes against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to or bound by any collective bargaining
or similar agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices
agreed to with any labor organization or employee association applicable to
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the Company\'s
knowledge, there are no organizing efforts by any union or other group seeking
to represent any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

3.12 _Compliance with Applicable Law._

  

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times since
December 31, 2012 held, all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations
necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership
of their respective properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each
(and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith), except where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of
obtaining and holding such license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor
the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, and to the knowledge of the Company, no suspension or cancellation of
any such necessary license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with and are not in material default or violation under any

relating to the origination, sale and servicing of mortgage and consumer

(i) used any funds of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for unlawful

relating to political activity, (ii) made any unlawful payment to foreign or

any of its Subsidiaries serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal
representative, guardian, conservator or investment adviser, in accordance
with the terms of the applicable governing documents and applicable Laws,
except here the failure to so administer such accounts would not reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. Since December 31, 2012, none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or, to the Company\'s knowledge, any director, officer, or
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust
or fiduciary duty with respect to any such fiduciary account, and the

either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no reasonable basis for any
such proceeding, claim, action or investigation. The Company is not subject to
any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter agreement or memorandum of

ARTICLE IV 
  
  
  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

  

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the
Company concurrently herewith (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Parent that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect,
and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this Article IV
shall be deemed to qualify (A) any other section of this Article IV
specifically referenced

  

 

30  

  

or cross-referenced and (B) other sections of this Article IV to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a
specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such other sections or (b) as disclosed in any Parent
SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor
disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of
risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other
statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature), Parent hereby represents and warrants to the
Company as follows:

  

4.1 _Corporate Organization._

  

(a) Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is a bank holding company
duly registered under the BHC Act that has elected to be treated as financial
holding company under the BHC Act. Parent has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Parent is duly licensed or qualified to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted
by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or
leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. True and complete copies of the Parent Articles and Parent Bylaws, as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made
available by Parent to the Company.

  

(b) Each Subsidiary of Parent (a " _Parent Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There are
no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of Parent to pay dividends or
distributions except under applicable state law or, in the case of a
Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or
distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit
accounts of each Subsidiary of Parent that is an insured depository
institution are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the
fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be
paid in connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for
the termination of such insurance are pending or, to Parent\'s knowledge,
threatened.

  

4.2 _Capitalization._

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 200,000,000 shares of
Class A Voting Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the "
_Parent Common Stock_ "), 200,000,000 shares of Parent Class B Common Stock,
and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which
no shares of preferred stock are issued or outstanding. As of the date of this
Agreement, no shares of capital stock or other voting

  

 

31

Stock held in treasury, (iii) 3,075,410 shares of Parent Common Stock reserved
for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options to purchase shares

of Parent Common Stock issued and subsequently cancelled in net settlements
for income tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted shares granted under
a Parent Stock Plan, (v) 2,616,956 shares of Parent Common Stock reserved for
issuance pursuant to future grants under the Parent Stock Plans, (vi)
18,327,190 shares of Parent Class B Common Stock issued and 16,553,429 shares
of Parent Class B Common Stock outstanding and (vii) 1,773,761 shares of
Parent Class B Common Stock held in treasury. As used herein, the " _Parent
Stock Plans_ " means all employee and director equity incentive plans of
Parent in effect as of the date of this Agreement and agreements for equity
awards in respect of Parent Common Stock and Parent Class B Common Stock
granted by Parent under the inducement grant exception. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Class B Common Stock have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof. No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have
the right to vote on any matters on which shareholders of Parent may vote are
issued or outstanding. Except as set forth in Section 4.2(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, no trust preferred or
subordinated debt securities of Parent are issued or outstanding. Other than
equity awards granted under a Parent Stock Plan, there are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or
convertible securities or other commitments or agreements obligating Parent to
issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such
securities.

  

(b) There are no voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or other
agreements in effect pursuant to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has a
contractual or other obligation with respect to the voting or transfer of the
Parent Common Stock or other equity interests of Parent.

  

(c) Parent owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of Parent Bank,
free and clear of any Liens, and all of such shares or equity ownership
interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable (except, with respect to Parent Subsidiaries that are insured
depository institutions, as provided under 12 U.S.C. § 55 or any comparable
provision of applicable state law) and free of preemptive rights, with no
personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Parent Subsidiary
has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary.

  

4.3 _Authority; No Violation._

  

(a) Parent has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly

  

 

32  

  

approved by the Board of Directors of Parent. The Board of Directors of Parent
has determined that the Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, is in the best interests of Parent and its shareholders and has
directed that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby be
submitted to Parent\'s shareholders for adoption at a meeting of such

majority of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Requisite

Common Stock in connection with the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement
by a vote of the majority of votes cast at the Parent Meeting (as defined in
Section 6.3), no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent are
necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Parent and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
the Company) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable
against Parent in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such
enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions). The shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger (subject to the adoption of the
Merger Agreement by the holders of Parent Common Stock) have been validly
authorized and, when issued, will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and no current or past shareholder of Parent will have any
preemptive right or similar rights in respect thereof.

  

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, nor the
consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance
by Parent with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) violate any
provision of the Parent Articles or the Parent Bylaws, or (ii) assuming that
the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section 4.4 are duly
obtained and/or made, (x) violate any law, statute, code, ordinance, rule,
regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to Parent,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets or (y)

any benefit under, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the
termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the
performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
respective properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which
they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in
the case of clause (ii) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches,
defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations or creations which either
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  

4.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (a) the filing of applications,
filings and notices, as applicable, with the Federal Reserve Board under the
BHC Act and approval of such applications, filings and notices, (b) the filing

and the approval of the listing of such Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq, no
consents or approvals of or filings or registrations with any Governmental
Entity are necessary in connection with (A) the execution and delivery by
Parent of this Agreement or (B) the consummation by Parent of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the Bank Merger). As of
the date hereof, Parent is not aware of any reason why the necessary
regulatory approvals and consents will not be received in order to permit
consummation of the Merger and Bank Merger on a timely basis.

  

4.5 _Reports._

  

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or furnished, as
applicable), all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2013 with any Regulatory
Agencies, including any report, registration or statement required to be filed
(or furnished, as applicable) pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of
the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency,
and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith, except where the failure to file such report, registration or
statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. Except for examinations of Parent and its Subsidiaries conducted by a
Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business, no Regulatory Agency has
initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Parent,
investigation into the business or operations of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2013, except where such proceedings or
investigation would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. There is no unresolved
violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to
any report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  

(b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2013
(the " _Parent SEC Reports_ ") is publicly available. No such Parent SEC
Report, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of
this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify

  

 

34  

  

information as of an earlier date. As of their respective dates, all Parent
SEC Reports filed or furnished under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement,
no executive officer of Parent has failed in any respect to make the
certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
comments from or material unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to
any of the Parent SEC Reports.

  

4.6 _Financial Statements._

  

(a) The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in shareholders\' equity and consolidated financial position of
Parent and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited
statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii)
complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto.
The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, since January
1, 2013, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not resigned (or informed Parent that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Parent as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Parent on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due),
except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015 (including any notes
thereto) and incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since September 30, 2015, or in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent (i) has implemented
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Parent,
including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive

  

 

35  

  

officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within those
entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parent\'s outside
auditors and the audit committee of Parent\'s Board of Directors (x) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent\'s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(y) to the knowledge of Parent, any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parent\'s internal controls over financial reporting. To the knowledge of
Parent, there is no reason to believe that Parent\'s outside auditors and its
chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

  

(d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of Parent, oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or written claim that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of
Directors of Parent or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of Parent, to
any director or officer of Parent.

  

4.7 _Taxes._

  

(a) Each of the Parent and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (taking
into account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all
jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return. All material
Taxes of the Parent and its Subsidiaries that are due have been fully and
timely paid. No deficiency with respect to a material amount of Taxes has been
proposed, asserted or assessed, in each case, in writing, against the Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no pending or threatened in writing
disputes, claims, audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any
material Taxes of the Parent and its Subsidiaries or the assets of the Parent
and its Subsidiaries. There are no Liens for material Taxes (except Taxes not
yet due and payable) on any of the assets of the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within
the past two (2) years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related
transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the
Merger is also a part, a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a
distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section
355 of the Code.

  

 

36  

  

4.8 _Broker\'s Fees_. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary nor any of
their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or
financial advisor or incurred any liability for any broker\'s fees,
commissions or finder\'s fees in connection with the Merger or related
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than Evercore Group LLC.

  

4.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

contemplated hereby or as required or permitted by this Agreement, Parent and
its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all material
respects in the ordinary course.

  

4.10 _Legal Proceedings._

  

(a) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there
are no pending or, to Parent\'s knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
investigations of any nature against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or, to
Parent\'s knowledge, any of their current or former directors or executive
officers (i) that would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, or (ii) of a material
nature challenging the validity or propriety of this Agreement.

  

(b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction imposed upon Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger,
would apply to the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates).

  

4.11 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2012 held, all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,
rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where neither the
cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license,

information relating to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Each party will provide the other with copies of any
applications and all correspondence relating thereto prior to filing, other
than any portions of material filed in connection therewith that contain
competitively sensitive business or other proprietary information filed under
a claim of confidentiality. The parties hereto agree that they will consult
with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Each party
shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the
other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meetings and conferences.

  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of,
or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and

  

 

47  

  

(ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment so as to enable the Closing
to occur as soon as possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of businesses or assets of Parent, the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Parent or
the Company or their respective Subsidiaries to take, or agree to take, any
actions specified in this Section 6.1 that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be likely to have a material and adverse effect on Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, giving effect to the Merger (measured on a
scale relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a "
_Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

  

(d) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S‑4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(e) Parent and the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than one (1)
business day thereafter, advise each other upon receiving any communication
from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes
such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite
Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such
approval will be materially delayed.

  

6.2 _Access to Information._

  

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws and regulations,
including those applicable to confidential and supervisory information, each
of Parent and the Company, for the purposes of verifying the representations
and warranties of the other, discussing the continued employment of members of
Company\'s management and preparing for the Merger (including planning for the
integration of the operations of Company and Parent) and the other matters
contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all
its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel, information
technology systems, and records, and each shall reasonably cooperate with the
other party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or
consolidation of systems and business operations generally (including by
entering into customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements
with such service providers and/or the other party), and, during such period,
each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party such information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request.
Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any
interference with the other party\'s regular business operations during any
such access. Neither Parent nor the Company nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
where

  

 

48  

  

such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information
(after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint
defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold all information furnished by or
on behalf of the other party or any of such party\'s Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated September 1, 2015, between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries\' respective operations.

  

6.3 _Shareholders\' Approval_.

  

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall take, in accordance with applicable
law and the applicable bylaws and charter, all action necessary to convene a
meeting of its shareholders (the " _Company Meeting_ " and the " _Parent
Meeting_ ") to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S‑4 is
declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote and
the Requisite Parent Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger, and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type
customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders to
adopt a merger agreement, and each shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably practicable and on the same
date. The Board of Directors of each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of the Company and
Parent, as the case may be, the Requisite Company Vote, in the case of the
Company, and the Requisite Parent Vote, in the case of Parent, including by
communicating to its respective shareholders its recommendation (and including
such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. However, subject to
Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of the Company or
Parent, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it
could reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in
submitting this Agreement to its shareholders, such Board of Directors may
submit this Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation, or may
change its recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement
as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the
Board of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation
or change in its recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy
Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent
required by

  

 

49  

  

law; _provided_ that the Board of Directors may not take any actions under
this sentence unless (i) it gives the other party at least four (4) business
days\' prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a
reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its
determination to take such action (including, in the event that such action is
taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and
conditions and the identity of the third party in any such Acquisition
Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable
detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of such notice
period, the Board of Directors takes into account any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party and after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors, determines in good faith that it nevertheless could
reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment
to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal
for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new notice period as
referred to in this Section 6.3.

  

(b) The Company or Parent shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting or the
Parent Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting
is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote.
The Company and the Parent shall only be required to adjourn or postpone the
Company Meeting or the Parent Meeting, as applicable, and as requested by the
other party for one or more periods of up to twenty days each, twice pursuant
to this Section 6.3(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, each
of the Company Meeting and the Parent Meeting shall be convened and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of the Company and Parent at
the Company Meeting and Parent Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of
voting on the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the other matters
contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
either the Company or Parent of such obligation.

  

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of
this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject
to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

  

 

50  

  

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
(1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide continuing employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with (i) annual base salary or wages that are no less than the
annual base salary or wages in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) other compensation opportunities and employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that Parent may
satisfy its obligation under this Section 6.6(a)(ii) for a transitional period
by providing such compensation and employee benefits on terms that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide, subject to execution (and non-revocation) by the applicable
employee of a release of claims in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
to each continuing employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries whose
employment is terminated by Parent and its Subsidiaries without "cause" during
the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date with severance benefits that are not less
favorable than the severance benefits that would have been paid or provided to
such continuing employee under the Company\'s severance benefit plan or
program identified in Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule as in
effect immediately prior to the date hereof.

  

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries become eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) waive all preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
such employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to
the extent that such preexisting conditions, exclusions or waiting periods
would apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such
employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or
coinsurance and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a Company
Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any
applicable deductible, co-payment, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such
employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New
Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that
the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent that it
would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B)
for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan or benefit plan that provides
retiree welfare benefits, or (C) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or
provides grandfathered benefits.

  

(c) The Surviving Corporation agrees to assume and honor all Company Benefit
Plans in accordance with their terms as of the date hereof, it being
understood that this sentence shall not be construed to limit the ability of
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates to amend or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan to the extent that such amendment or termination is
permitted by the terms of the applicable plan. Parent hereby acknowledges and

  

 

51  

  

agrees that a "change in control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of
the Company Benefit Plans identified in Section 3.11(k) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule will occur at the Effective Time.

  

(d) If requested by Parent in writing at least twenty (20) business days prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause any 401(k) plan sponsored or
maintained by the Company (each, a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be terminated
effective as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and subject to
the occurrence of the Closing. If Parent requests that any Company 401(k) Plan
be terminated, (i) the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such
plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to
reasonable review and comment by Parent) not later than two (2) business days
prior to the Closing Date, (ii) the continuing employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the
Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of
its Subsidiaries (a " _Parent 401(k_ ) _Plan_ "), and (iii) Parent and the
Company shall take any and all actions as may be required, including
amendments to any Company 401(k) Plan and/or Parent 401(k) Plan, to permit the
continuing employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are then actively
employed to make rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code)
in the form of cash, notes (in the case of loans), or a combination thereof.

  

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation,
the Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with
or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, the Company,
Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the
services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other
employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or
limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan,
New Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the final
sentence of Section 9.11, nothing in this Section 6.6, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any current or former
employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.6.

  

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, each present and former director, officer or employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or fiduciaries of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under Company Benefit Plans (in each case, when acting in such capacity)
(collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective
Time,

  

 

52  

  

arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, (i) the fact that such
person is or was a director, officer, employee or fiduciary of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the consideration and approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred by such
Company Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law;
_provided_ that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form) to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified Party is
not entitled to indemnification.

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company (
_provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and
directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or
events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual
basis, an amount in excess of two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the
aggregate annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be maintained policies of insurance which provide the maximum
coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of
the foregoing, the Company, in consultation with Parent, may (and at the
request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to)
obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six (6)-year "tail" policy under
the Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\' insurance policy providing
equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate,
does not exceed the total of the annual Premium Caps. If the Company purchases
such a "tail" policy, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such
"tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder.

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each the
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns, consolidates with
or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity
of such consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all of its
assets or deposits to any other entity or engages in any similar transaction,
then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will
expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

  

(d) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Company under
this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified in a manner so as to
adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to
the benefit of this Section 6.7 without the prior written consent of the
affected Company Indemnified Party.

  

 

53  

  

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one
hand, and a Subsidiary of the Company, on the other hand) or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by the other party, at the expense of
the party who makes any such request.

  

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Parent and the Company shall each promptly advise the
other party of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it (a) that
has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (b)
which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article
VII; _provided_ that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or
the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 to be
satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party
failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying fact, change,
event or circumstance would independently result in a failure of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 to be satisfied.

  

6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates
and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties
hereto that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends,
or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares
of Company Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common Stock any such holder
receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

  

6.11 _Board Appointments_. Parent shall take all appropriate action so that,
as of the Effective Time, the number of directors constituting the Board of
Directors of Parent and Parent Bank shall be increased by two, and two
individuals, one of whom will be selected by Parent, in consultation with the
Company, from the current directors of the Company and one of whom will be
selected by Oak Hill Capital Partners, shall be appointed as directors of
Parent. Such directors shall serve in such roles subject to the policies of
Parent generally applicable to the Board of Directors.

  

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals._

  

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with
respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person
concerning or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data
to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to,
any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that, prior to receipt of the Requisite
Company Vote, in the event the Company receives an

  

 

54  

  

unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries\' Representatives to, furnish or
cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such
negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel,
and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to
take such actions could reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to
providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the
foregoing proviso, the Company shall have provided such information to Parent,
and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party
on terms not materially less favorable to it than the Confidentiality
Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with
any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company. The Company will, and will
cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than Parent, with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will promptly (and in any event within one (1) business
day) advise Parent following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the
identity of the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), and will
promptly (and in any event within one (1) business day) advise Parent of any
related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis,
including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof.
Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the
Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives not to on its
behalf, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or other
definitive transaction agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section 6.12(a)) relating
to any Acquisition Proposal). As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third-party
indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or
indirect, of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or twenty-five (25%) or more of any class of
equity or voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five (25%) or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-
tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such
third party beneficially owning twenty-five (25%) or more of any class of
equity or voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five (25%) or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
twenty-five (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company, except,
in each case, any sale of whole loans and securitizations in the ordinary
course of business and any bona fide internal reorganization.

  

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board
of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act

  

 

55  

  

with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that such Rules will in no
way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules
would otherwise have under this Agreement.

  

  

6.13 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall each use their
reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to
ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement required by
(i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) a request by a Governmental Entity or
(iii) an obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange, the Company and Parent agree to consult with each other
and to obtain the advance approval of the other party (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press
release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

6.14 _Change of Method_. Parent may at any time change the method of effecting
the Merger and the Bank Merger (including by providing for the merger of the
Company with a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent) if and to the extent
requested by Parent, and the Company agrees to enter into such amendments to
this Agreement as Parent may reasonably request in order to give effect to
such restructuring; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change or amendment
shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration
provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the
Merger with respect to the Company\'s shareholders or (iii) be reasonably
likely to cause the Closing to be prevented or materially delayed or the
receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or materially
delayed.

  

6.15 _Takeover Statutes_. Neither Parent nor the Company shall take any action
that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each of
Parent and the Company shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any
Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and the Company will grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

  

6.16 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. The Company and Parent
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers
and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section

to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares
of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that
compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section
6.16. The Board of Directors of Parent

  

 

56  

  

and of the Company, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such
term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall
promptly, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as
may be necessary or appropriate to cause any dispositions of Company Common
Stock or Company Equity Awards pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and by any Company Insiders who, immediately following the
Merger, will be officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, to be exempt
from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law.

  

6.17 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
notify each other in writing of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing,
investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced,
brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving, any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or
the Company, as applicable, threatened against Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be
expected to question the validity of this Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement
or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or
to be taken by Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries with
respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of
any shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or
affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no
such settlement shall be agreed without Parent\'s prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

6.18 _Assumption of Company Debt_. Parent agrees to execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving
Corporation, at or prior to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental
indentures, guarantees, and other instruments required for the due assumption
of the Company\'s obligations in respect of its outstanding debt, guarantees,
securities, and other agreements to the extent required by the terms of such
debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements. Immediately after the
Effective Time, Parent agrees to pay the outstanding debt of the Company set
forth on Section 3.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

6.19 _No Control of Other Party\'s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations
of Parent or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its and its Subsidiaries\' respective operations.

ARTICLE VIII 
  
  TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

  

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company:

  

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument;

  

(b) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity that must grant
a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the Bank
Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable
order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or
making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the
failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure
of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

  

 

60  

  

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the first (1st) anniversary of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to
occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of
such party set forth herein;

  

(d) by either Parent or the Company ( _provided_ that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any
such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent,
or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach or
failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other
breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to
be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date,
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a
termination by Parent, or Section 7.3, in the case of a termination by the
Company, and which is not cured by the earlier of the Termination Date and the
date that is forty-five (45) days following written notice to the Company, in
the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination
by the Company, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period;

  

(e) by Parent, if (i) prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company (A) submits
this Agreement to its shareholders without a recommendation for approval, or
otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely qualifies or modifies (or
discloses its intention to withdraw or materially and adversely qualify or
modify) its recommendation as contemplated by Section 6.3(a), or recommends to
its shareholders (or fails to recommend against) an Acquisition Proposal other
than the Merger, or (B) materially breaches its obligations under Section 6.3
or Section 6.12; or (ii) a tender offer or exchange offer for twenty percent
(20%) or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is commenced
(other than by Parent or a Subsidiary thereof), and the Board of Directors of
the Company recommends that the shareholders of the Company tender their
shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that
such stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within the ten
(10)-business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act;

  

(f) by the Company, if prior to such time as the Requisite Parent Vote is
obtained, Parent or the Board of Directors of Parent submits this Agreement to
its shareholders without a recommendation for approval, or otherwise withdraws
or materially and adversely qualifies or modifies (or discloses its intention
to withdraw or materially and adversely qualify or modify) its recommendation
as contemplated by Section 6.3(a); or

  

(g) by Parent or Company, if the Requisite Company Vote is not obtained at the
Company Meeting or the Requisite Parent Vote is not obtained at the Parent
Meeting, in each case after any adjournments required by Section 6.3 of the
Agreement.

  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d), (e), (f) or (g) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in

  

 

61  

  

accordance with Section 9.5, specifying the provision or provisions hereof
pursuant to which such termination is effected.

  

8.2 _Effect of Termination._

  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no effect, and none of Parent, the Company, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any
liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(b), this Section
8.2 and Article IX shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor the Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or
damages arising out of its fraud or willful and material breach of any
provision of this Agreement (which, in the case of the Company, shall include
the loss to the holders of Company Common Stock of the economic benefits of
the Merger, including the loss of the premium offered to the shareholders of
the Company).

  

(b) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to senior management of the
Company or shall have been made directly to its shareholders generally or any
person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company and (A) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without
the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained or pursuant to Section 8.1(g)
(other than in the case of a termination as a result of the failure to obtain
the Parent Requisite Vote either (I) by the Company if the Requisite Company
Vote has then been obtained or (II) by Parent) or (B) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and (C) prior to
the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the
Company either (x) enters into a definitive agreement or (y) consummates a
transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same
Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then the Company shall, on
the earlier of the date that it enters into such definitive agreement and the
date of consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same
day funds, a fee equal to $14,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_
that, for purposes of this Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%."

  

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), then the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same
day funds, the Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practical after the
date of termination (and, in any event, within three (3) business days
thereafter).

  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(f), then Parent shall pay the Company, by wire transfer of same
day funds, the Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practical after the
date of termination (and, in any event, within three (3) business days
thereafter).

  

 

62  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum aggregate
amount of fees payable by either party under this Section 8.2 shall be equal
to the Termination Fee.

  

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall
not be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The
parties agree that, upon termination of this Agreement under circumstances
where the Termination Fee is payable to it and such Termination Fee is paid in
full, the party who received the Termination Fee shall be precluded from any
other remedy against the other party in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, at law or in equity or otherwise, and it
shall not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind,
including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the other
party or any of the other party\'s Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or
affiliates or their respective representatives in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(f) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2,
and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or
any portion thereof, the non-paying party shall pay the reasonable costs and
expenses of the other party (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if the Company or Parent,
as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section
8.2, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the
period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is
actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as
announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the
date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing
as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.
The amounts payable by the Company and Parent pursuant to Sections 8.2(b) and
8.2(c) constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the
case of fraud or willful misconduct, shall be the sole monetary remedy of the
non-paying party in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in
such sections.

CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT

  

 

66

PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY

9.11 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in contravention
hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in Section 6.7, which is intended to benefit each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heir and representatives, this
Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not
intended to and does not confer upon any person other than the parties hereto
any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance herewith without notice or liability to any other person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  

9.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof,
including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
(including the parties\' obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

  

 

67  

  

9.13 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

  

9.14 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e‑mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e‑mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e‑mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
