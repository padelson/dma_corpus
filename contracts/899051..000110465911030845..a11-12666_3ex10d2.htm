GUARANTY

 



 

This GUARANTY, dated as of May 17, 2011, is made by White Mountains Insurance
Group, Ltd., an exempted Bermuda limited company (the " _Guarantor_ "), in
favor of The **** Allstate Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ ")
and its successors and assigns.

 



 

A. Concurrently with the execution of this Guaranty, White Mountains Holdings
(Luxembourg) S.a r.l., a Luxembourg _soci ete a responsabilite limitee_ ("
_Seller_ "), and Buyer have entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "
_Purchase Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, Seller has
agreed to sell, and Buyer has agreed to purchase, (i) all of the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock of White Mountains, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, and Answer Financial Inc., a Delaware corporation.

 



 

B. The Guarantor directly or through its subsidiaries owns all of the
outstanding capital stock of Seller.

 



 

C. This Guaranty is the agreement referred to as the Parent Guaranty in, and
its execution and delivery by the Guarantor is a condition to Buyers
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by, the Purchase
Agreement.

 



 

D. Capitalized terms used and not defined herein have the respective meanings
ascribed to them in the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

Accordingly, in consideration of the foregoing, and for other good and
valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Guarantor hereby agrees for the benefit of Buyer and its
successors and assigns as follows:

 



 

Section 1. _Guaranty_. The Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to Buyer:

 



 

(a) the prompt and complete payment in full as and when due and payable by any
Seller Party of any and all amounts payable by any Seller Party pursuant to
any of the Purchase Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, subject to the
terms and limitations thereof; and

 



 

(b) the prompt and complete performance in full by each Seller Party of its
other obligations under the terms of each Transaction Agreement to which it is
a party, subject to the terms and limitations thereof (the amounts payable by,
and all other obligations of, the Seller Parties under the Transaction
Agreements, being sometimes collectively referred to herein as " _Guaranteed
Obligations_ ").

      
 

 



 

This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment, performance and compliance and not of
collectibility and is in no way conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to
collect from or enforce performance or compliance by any Seller Party or upon
any other event or condition whatsoever. If for any reason whatsoever any
Seller Party shall fail or be unable duly, punctually and fully to pay such
amounts as and when the same shall become due and payable or to perform or
comply with any other Guaranteed Obligation (in each case after the expiration
of any cure periods in respect of such failure or inability expressly set
forth in the Transaction Agreement under which the applicable Guaranteed
Obligation arises), the Guarantor shall forthwith pay or cause to be paid such
amounts to Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer entitled thereto under the terms of
such Transaction Agreement, in lawful money of the United States, at the place
specified in the applicable Transaction Agreement, or perform or comply with
such Guaranteed Obligations or cause such Guaranteed Obligations to be
performed or complied with together with interest (in the amounts and to the
extent required of such Seller Party under such Transaction Agreement) on any
amount due and owing from such Seller Party. The Guarantor, promptly after
demand, shall reimburse Buyer for all costs and expenses of collecting such
amounts or otherwise enforcing this Guaranty, including, without limitation,
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel.

 



 

Section 2. _Representations and Warranties_. The Guarantor hereby represents
and warrants to Buyer as follows:

 



 

(a) _Organization, Good Standing, Etc_. The Guarantor is an exempted Bermuda
limited company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of Bermuda and has all requisite corporate or organizational power
and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and to enter into and
to carry out the terms of this Guaranty. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Guaranty by the Guarantor have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action of the Guarantor.

 



 

(b) _Enforceability_. This Guaranty constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of the Guarantor enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exception.

 



 

(c) _Relationship to Seller_. The Guarantor owns, directly or indirectly, all
of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Seller.

 



 

(d) _Qualification_. The Guarantor is duly qualified and in good standing to
do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of its business or the ownership, leasing or holding of its properties makes
such qualification necessary, except such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and

 



      
 

 



 

wound not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the
ability of the Guarantor to perform its obligations hereunder.

 



 

(e) _Financial Capacity_. The Guarantor has the financial capacity to perform
all of its obligations under this Guaranty, and entering into this Guaranty
will not render the Guarantor insolvent.

 



 

(f) _Litigation, Etc_. There is no Litigation pending or, to the knowledge of
the Guarantor, threatened that questions the validity of this Guaranty.

 



 

(g) _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance by the Guarantor
of this Guaranty do not and will not (i) conflict with or result in a
violation or breach of the memorandum of association and byelaws or other
organizational documents of the Guarantor, (ii) conflict with or result in a
violation or breach of any provision of any Law applicable to the Guarantor or
any of its properties or assets or (iii) result in any breach of, or
constitute a default (or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a default) under any contract, agreement or
other instrument to which the Guarantor is a party or by which the Guarantor
or any of its properties or assets is bound or subject, except, in the case of
clause (iii), for any such breaches or defaults that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse
effect on the ability of the Guarantor to perform its obligations hereunder.

 



 

(h) _Governmental Consent_. The execution and delivery by the Guarantor of
this Guaranty and the performance by the Guarantor of this Guaranty will not
require any consent, approval, license, permit, order, qualification or
authorization of, or registration or other action by, or any filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Authority, and no documents or instruments
are required to be filed or recorded with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Guarantors entry into this Guaranty, the Guarantors
performance of its obligations hereunder or the enforcement of this Guaranty.

 



 

Section 3. _Guarantor s Obligations Unconditional_. The obligations of the
Guarantor under this Guaranty are absolute and unconditional obligations of
the Guarantor, and shall remain in full force and effect without regard to,
and shall not be released or discharged by any of the following:

 



 

(a) any amendment of or change in, or termination or waiver of, any of the
Transaction Agreements;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) any furnishing, acceptance or release of, or any defect in any security
for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations;

 



 

(c) any failure, omission or delay on the part of a Seller Party to conform or
comply with any term of any of the Transaction Agreements;

 



 

(d) any waiver of the payment, performance or observance of any of the
obligations, conditions, covenants or agreements contained in any Transaction
Agreement, or any other waiver, consent, extension, indulgence, compromise,
settlement, release or other action or inaction under or in respect of any of
the Transaction Agreements;

 



 

(e) any acceptance by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of partial payment or
performance by a Seller Party;

 



 

(f) any failure, omission or delay on the part of Buyer to enforce, assert or
exercise any right, power or remedy conferred on it in this Guaranty;

 



 

(g) any voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
arrangement, assignment for the benefit of creditors, receivership,
conservatorship, custodianship, liquidation, marshalling of assets and
liabilities or similar proceedings with respect to any Seller Party or any
other person or any of their respective properties or creditors, or any action
taken by any trustee or receiver or by any court in any such proceeding;

 



 

(h) any discharge, termination, cancellation, frustration, irregularity,
invalidity or unenforceability, in whole or in part, of any of the Transaction
Agreements or any other agreement or instrument referred to in paragraph (a)
above or any term hereof;

 



 

(i) any merger or consolidation of any Seller Party or the Guarantor into or
with any other corporation or other entity, or any sale, lease or transfer of
any of the assets of any Seller Party or the Guarantor to any other person;

 



 

(j) any change in the ownership of any shares of capital stock of any Seller
Party or the Guarantor, or any change in the corporate relationship between
any Seller Party and the Guarantor, or any termination of such relationship;
or

 



 

(k) any other occurrence, circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether
similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, whether foreseen or unforeseen, and
any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
defense or discharge of the liabilities of a guarantor or surety or that might
otherwise limit recourse against the Guarantor.

 



      
 

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, except as provided
in the second to last sentence of this paragraph: (x) the Guarantor shall not
be obligated to pay or perform any Guaranteed Obligation of a Seller Party to
the extent that such Seller Party is not required to pay or perform such
Guaranteed Obligation as a result of any right or offset, counterclaim or
other defense available to such Seller Party with respect to such Guaranteed
Obligation in accordance with the provisions of the Transaction Agreement
under which such Guaranteed Obligation arises (collectively, a " _Seller Party
Defense_ "); and (y) the Guarantor shall be entitled to assert any Seller
Party Defense to the same extent that any such Seller Party Defense could be
asserted by a Seller Party in any action brought by Buyer to enforce a
Guaranteed Obligation against such Seller Party, except for any Seller Party
Defense asserted by a Seller Party in connection with an action brought by
Buyer against a Seller Party to enforce a Guaranteed Obligation which Seller
Party Defense has been finally adjudicated in favor of Buyer. In no event
shall any stay or discharge or other impairment of or limitation on any
Guaranteed Obligation as the result of any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation
or other like proceeding relating to a Seller Party or any action taken with
respect to any Transaction Agreement by any trustee or receiver, or by any
court, in any such proceeding, give rise to any defense to payment or
performance by the Guarantor hereunder. For purposes of this paragraph, the
term "Seller Party" shall not be deemed to include the Guarantor.

 



 

Section 4. _Waiver_. The Guarantor unconditionally waives, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, (a) notice of any of the matters referred to in
Section 3, (b) notice to the Guarantor of the incurrence of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations, notice to the Guarantor or any Seller Party of any
breach or default by a Seller Party with respect to any of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any other notice that may be required, by Law or otherwise, to
preserve any rights of Buyer against the Guarantor, or (c) presentment to or
demand of payment from any Seller Party or the Guarantor with respect to any
Transaction Agreement or protest for nonpayment or dishonor.

 



 

Section 5. _Subrogation_. The Guarantor shall not seek to exercise any rights
of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnity arising from payments made by the
Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of this Guaranty until the full and
complete payment or performance and discharge of all of the Guaranteed
Obligations.

 



 

Section 6. _Effect of Bankruptcy Proceedings, etc._ This Guaranty shall
continue to be effective or be automatically reinstated, as the case may be,
if at any time any payment made by any person on account of any of the sums
due Buyer or any of its Affiliates under any Transaction Agreement is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by Buyer or such Affiliate
upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of
any Seller Party or any other person, or upon or as a result of the
appointment of a custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar

 



      
 

 



 

powers with respect to such Seller Party or other person or any substantial
part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been
made.

 



 

Section 7. _Term of Guaranty_. This Guaranty shall continue in full force and
effect and shall not be discharged until such time as all of the Guaranteed
Obligations shall be paid and performed in full.

 



 

Section 8. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, waivers and other
communications required or permitted to be given or made under this Guaranty
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made if (a)
delivered personally, (b) mailed by certified or registered mail with postage
prepaid, (c) sent by next-Business Day or overnight mail or delivery, or (d)
