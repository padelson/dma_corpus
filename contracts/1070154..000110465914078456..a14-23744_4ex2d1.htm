ARTICLE II

 



 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

 



 

2.1 _Sterling to Make Shares Available_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Sterling shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent
designated by Sterling and reasonably acceptable to Hudson Valley (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates or, at Sterlings
option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively, referred to
herein as " _certificates_ "), representing the shares of Sterling Common
Stock, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates
for shares of Sterling Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "), to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to
Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Hudson Valley Common
Stock.

 



 

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than 10 days thereafter, Sterling shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of one or more Certificates representing shares of
Hudson Valley Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have
been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive Sterling Common
Stock pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for certificates representing the number of whole shares of
Sterling Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the
shares of Hudson Valley Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.2(b). Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for
exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly
completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Sterling Common Stock to which such holder of Hudson Valley Common Stock shall
have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a check
representing the amount of (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which
such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (B)
any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.2, and the Certificate or Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Certificates.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon surrender, the number of whole shares of Sterling Common Stock
which the shares of Hudson Valley Common Stock represented by such Certificate
have been converted into the right to

 



      
 

 



 

receive and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends
or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

 



 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Sterling
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
this Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Sterling
Common Stock which the shares of Hudson Valley Common Stock represented by
such Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

 



 

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Sterling Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Sterling Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Hudson Valley of the shares of Hudson Valley Common Stock
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
certificates representing shares of Sterling Common Stock as provided in this
Article II.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Sterling Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Sterling Common Stock shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of
Sterling. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Sterling shall
pay to each former stockholder of Hudson Valley who otherwise would be
entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the
nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale
prices of Sterling Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "
_NYSE_ ") as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for the five (5) full
trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date (the " _Sterling
Share Closing Price_ ") by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the
nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Sterling Common Stock
which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section
1.4.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Hudson Valley for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of Hudson
Valley who have not theretofore

 



      
 

 



 

complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the shares of Sterling Common Stock, cash in lieu
of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the
Sterling Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Hudson
Valley Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Sterling, Hudson Valley, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Hudson Valley Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.

 



 

(g) Sterling shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Sterling Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
this Section 2.2 or any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Hudson Valley Common Stock such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Sterling or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Hudson Valley Common Stock in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by Sterling or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

 



 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Sterling, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Sterling may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Sterling Common
Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Hudson Valley
to Sterling concurrently herewith (the " _Hudson Valley Disclosure Schedule_
"); _provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an
exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in
the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b)
the mere inclusion of an item in the Hudson Valley Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by
Hudson Valley that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of
Article III shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article III
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of Article
III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the

such disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as disclosed in any
Hudson Valley Reports filed by Hudson Valley since December 31, 2013, and
prior to the date

 



      
 

 



 

hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading
"Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Hudson Valley hereby
represents and warrants to Sterling as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) Hudson Valley is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of New York, is a bank holding
company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
(" _BHC Act_ "). Hudson Valley has the corporate power and authority to own or
lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. Hudson Valley is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Hudson Valley. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_
" means, with respect to Sterling, Hudson Valley or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties,
results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to
this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the
impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting
requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or
regulations of general applicability to companies in the industries in which
such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts
or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global,
national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or
acts of terrorism) or in economic or market conditions affecting the financial
services industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its
Subsidiaries, (D) public disclosure of the transactions contemplated hereby or
actions expressly required by this Agreement or actions or omissions that are

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (F) changes proximately caused
by the impact of the execution or announcement of the Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby on relationships with
customers or employees (including the loss of personnel subsequent to the date
of this Agreement); except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B), or (C), to
the extent that the effects of such change are materially disproportionately
adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of
operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, as compared to other companies in the industry in which such party
and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement,
the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any person, means any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, bank or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, or person of which (i)
such first person directly or indirectly owns or controls at least a majority
of the securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting
power to elect a majority of the board of directors or others performing

the power to appoint a general partner, manager or managing member or others
performing similar functions.

by Hudson Valley to Sterling.

 



 

(b) Each Subsidiary of Hudson Valley (a " _Hudson Valley Subsidiary_ ") (i) is
duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions

which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Hudson Valley and (iii) has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any
Subsidiary of Hudson Valley to pay dividends or distributions except, in the
case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends
or distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The
deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of Hudson Valley that is an insured
depository institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest

Estate Holdings, Inc., Hudson Valley owns, directly or indirectly, all of the

purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary.

related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and records of Hudson Valley and its Subsidiaries,
(ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of
operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders equity and consolidated
financial position of Hudson Valley and its Subsidiaries for the respective

respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except,
in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The
books and records of Hudson Valley and its Subsidiaries have been, and are
being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any
other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. Neither KPMG LLP nor Crowe Horwath LLP has resigned (or informed
Hudson Valley that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent
public accountants of Hudson Valley as a result of or in connection with any
disagreements with Hudson Valley on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 



 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Hudson Valley, neither Hudson
Valley nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of Hudson Valley included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2014
(including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2014, or in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Hudson Valley and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Hudson Valley or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Hudson Valley. Hudson Valley (x) has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) to
ensure that material information relating to Hudson Valley, including its
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of Hudson Valley by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (y) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Hudson Valleys outside auditors and the audit committee of Hudson Valleys
Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Hudson Valleys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Hudson Valleys internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures
were made in writing by management to Hudson Valleys auditors and audit
committee and a copy has previously been made available to Sterling. There is
no reason to believe that Hudson Valleys outside auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-
offs and accruals) of Hudson Valley or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that Hudson Valley or any of its Subsidiaries
has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no
attorney representing Hudson Valley or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by Hudson Valley or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of

on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and
records of Hudson Valley.

 



 

(j) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or
instituted, and, to Hudson Valleys knowledge, no set of circumstances exists
that may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against
the Hudson Valley Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their
duties to the Hudson Valley Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts

Affiliate nor any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any
"prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section
406 of ERISA), which could subject any of the Hudson Valley Benefit Plans or
their related trusts, Hudson Valley, any of its Subsidiaries, any Hudson

Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any material tax or penalty
imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 



 

(l) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation

with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery
of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit
to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of Hudson Valley
or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of Hudson
Valley or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any Hudson Valley Benefit Plan or related trust.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable
(whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by Hudson Valley or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions
in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Neither Hudson Valley nor any
of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to a rabbi trust or similar

authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Sterling. True and complete copies of the Sterling Certificate and Sterling
Bylaws, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been
made available by Sterling to Hudson Valley.

jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership
or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling, and has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the

instrument or obligation to which Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound, except (in the case of clause (y) above) for such violations,
conflicts, breaches or defaults which either individually or in the aggregate
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Sterling.

 



 

(c) Sterling National Bank has adopted the Bank Merger Agreement, Sterling, as

Entity are necessary in connection with (A) the execution and delivery by
Sterling of this Agreement or (B) the consummation by Sterling of the Merger

4.5 _Reports_. Sterling and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all
reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required
to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file since January
1, 2011 with any Regulatory Agencies, including, without limitation, any
report, registration or statement required to be filed pursuant to the laws,
rules or regulations of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or
any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable
in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected

 



       
 

 



 

to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling. Except as set forth on Section
3.5 of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule and for normal examinations conducted
by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business of Sterling and its
Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding
or, to the knowledge of Sterling, investigation into the business or
operations of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2011,
except where such proceedings or investigation would not reasonably be
expected to be, either individually or in the aggregate, material to Sterling
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) there is no unresolved violation,
criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or
statement relating to any examinations or inspections of Sterling or any of
its Subsidiaries, and (iii) has been no formal or informal inquiries by, or
disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency with respect to the
business, operations, policies or procedures of Sterling or any of its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2011, in each case, which would reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Sterling.

 



 

4.6 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The financial statements of Sterling and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Sterling Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Sterling and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in stockholders equity and consolidated financial position of
Sterling and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited
statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii)
complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto.
The books and records of Sterling and its Subsidiaries have been, and are
being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any
other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. Crowe Horwath LLP has not resigned (or informed Sterling that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Sterling as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Sterling
on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 



 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling, neither Sterling nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due),
except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Sterling included in its Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2014 (including any notes
thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since June 30, 2014, or in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Sterling and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the

 



      
 

 



 

exclusive ownership and direct control of Sterling or its Subsidiaries or
accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for
any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling. Sterling (x) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to Sterling, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Sterling by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Sterlings outside
auditors and the audit committee of Sterlings Board of Directors (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Sterlings
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Sterlings internal controls over
financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to
Sterlings auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made
available to Hudson Valley. There is no reason to believe that Sterlings
outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant
to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

 



 

(d) Since January 1, 2011, (i) neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Sterling, any director, officer, auditor, accountant
or representative of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with
respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of
Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Sterling
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Sterling or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Sterling or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Sterling
or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of Sterling, to any director or
officer of Sterling.

 



 

4.7 _Broker s Fees_. With the exception of the engagement of Jefferies LLC
and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, neither Sterling nor any Sterling Subsidiary nor
any of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder
or financial advisor or incurred any liability for any brokers fees,
commissions or finders fees in connection with the Merger or related
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Sterling has disclosed to Hudson
Valley as of the date hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection
with the engagement by Sterling of Jefferies LLC and RBC Capital Markets, LLC
related to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 



 

(a) Since September 30, 2013, no event or events have occurred that have had
or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth on Section 4.8 of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule,
since September 30, 2013, Sterling and its Subsidiaries have carried on their
respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course.

(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on Sterling, neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any, and there are no pending or, to Sterlings knowledge, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental
or regulatory investigations of any nature against Sterling or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their current or former directors or executive officers
or challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction
imposed upon Sterling, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of Sterling or
any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger, would apply
to Sterling or any of its affiliates) that would reasonably be expected to be
material to Sterling and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

4.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. Each of Sterling and its Subsidiaries has duly
and timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all material Tax
Returns in all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by
it, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material
respects. Neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of
any extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return (other than
extensions to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course). All material
Taxes of Sterling and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax
Returns) that are due have been fully and timely paid. Each of Sterling and
its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material taxes required to have
been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, creditor, stockholder, independent contractor or other third party.
Neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or
waiver of the limitation period applicable to any material Tax that remains in
effect. The federal income Tax Returns of Sterling and its Subsidiaries for
all years to and including 2010 have been examined by the IRS or are Tax
Returns with respect to which the applicable period for assessment under
applicable law, after giving effect to extensions or waivers, has expired.
Neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of
assessment or proposed assessment in connection with any material amount of
Taxes, and there are no threatened in writing or pending disputes, claims,
audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any material Tax of
Sterling and its Subsidiaries or the assets of Sterling and its Subsidiaries.
Sterling has made available to Hudson Valley true and complete copies of any
private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or gain recognition
agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed in the last six years.
Neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any
Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other
than such an agreement or arrangement

 



      
 

 



 

exclusively between or among Sterling and its Subsidiaries). Neither Sterling
nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group
filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common
parent of which was Sterling) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any
person (other than Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither
Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two years or
otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related transactions)" within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part, a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intending to
qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Neither Sterling
nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a "reportable transaction"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.6011-4(b)(1). At no time
during the past five years has Sterling been a United States real property
holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

 



 

4.11 _SEC Reports_. Sterling has previously made available to Hudson Valley an
accurate and complete copy of each communication mailed by Sterling to its
stockholders since December 31, 2011 and prior to the date hereof. No such
communication or any final registration statement, prospectus, report,
schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or furnished to the SEC
since December 31, 2011 by Sterling pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act (the " _Sterling Reports_ ") as of the date thereof (and, in the
case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of
effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, except that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but
before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of
an earlier date. Since December 31, 2011, as of their respective dates, all
Sterling Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied
in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer
of Sterling has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of
him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date
of this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues
raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Sterling Reports.

 



 

4.12 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Sterling and each of its Subsidiaries
hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2011, held, all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,
rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where neither the
cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license,
franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or
assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling, and to the knowledge
of Sterling no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license,
franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Sterling and each of its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not in
material default or violation under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule,

4.13 _Certain Contracts_.

 



 

(a) Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written
or oral) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to which Sterling nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound as of the date hereof has been filed as an exhibit to the most recent
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by Sterling, or a Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K subsequent thereto (each, a " _Sterling
Contract_ "), and neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or
has received notice of, any violation of the above by any of the other parties
thereto which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling.

 



 

(b) Each Sterling Contract is valid and binding on Sterling or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Sterling. Sterling and each of its Subsidiaries has
in all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by
it to date under each Sterling Contract, except where such

 



      
 

 



 

noncompliance, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling. To Sterlings
knowledge each third-party counterparty to each Sterling Contract has in all
material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to
date under such Sterling Contract, except where such noncompliance, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Sterling, and no event or condition exists which
constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a
material default on the part of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries under any
such Sterling Contract, except where such default, either individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Sterling.

 



 

4.14 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Except as set forth on Section
4.14 of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule, neither Sterling nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement

been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has been since January 1,
2011, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2011,

suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that

that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to
pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its
business (each, whether or not set forth in the Sterling Disclosure Schedule,
a " _Sterling Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Sterling or any of its
Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2011, by any Regulatory Agency or
other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering

Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the

warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters

respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access, during

preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of
systems and business operations generally, and, during such period, each of
Sterling and Hudson Valley shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries
to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or
state banking laws (other than reports or documents which Sterling or Hudson
Valley, as the case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable
law), and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither Sterling nor Hudson
Valley nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
violate or prejudice the rights of Sterlings or Hudson Valleys, as the case
may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution
in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration
to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

 



 

(b) Each of Sterling and Hudson Valley shall hold all information furnished by
or on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated August 8, 2014, between Sterling and Hudson Valley (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



 

6.3 _Stockholders  Approvals_. Each of Sterling and Hudson Valley shall call
a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Sterling Meeting_ " and the " _Hudson
Valley Meeting_ ," respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable
after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite
Hudson Valley Vote and the Requisite Sterling Vote required in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger and, and, if so desired and mutually agreed,
upon other matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special
meeting of stockholders to adopt a merger agreement, and each shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably
practicable and on the same date. The Board of Directors of each of Sterling
and Hudson Valley shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
stockholders of Sterling and Hudson Valley, as the case may be, the Requisite
Sterling Vote, in the case of Sterling, and the Requisite Hudson Valley Vote,
in the case of Hudson Valley, including by communicating to its respective
stockholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. However, subject to Section 8.1 and

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of Hudson Valley or Sterling, after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting
this Agreement to its stockholders, such Board of Directors may (but shall not
be required to) submit this Agreement to its stockholders without
recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the
date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of
Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its
stockholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto to the extent required by law; _provided_ , that the Board
of Directors may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives
the other party at least three (3) business days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including,
in the event such action is taken by the Board of Directors of Hudson Valley
in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and
conditions of, and the identity of the third party making, any such
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in
reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of
such notice period, the Board of Directors takes into account any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party and after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment
to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal
for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new notice period as
referred to in this Section 6.3. Sterling or Hudson Valley shall adjourn or
postpone the Sterling Meeting or the Hudson Valley Meeting, as the case may
be, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there
are insufficient shares of Sterling Common Stock or Hudson Valley Common
Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if
on the date of such meeting Hudson Valley or Sterling, as applicable, has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to
obtain the Requisite Hudson Valley Vote or the Requisite Sterling Vote.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, each of the Sterling Meeting and
Hudson Valley Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted
to the stockholders of each of Sterling and Hudson Valley at the Sterling
Meeting and the Hudson Valley Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of voting
on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby,
and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either Sterling or
Hudson Valley of such obligation.

 



 

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of
this Agreement, each of Sterling and Hudson Valley shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by Hudson Valley or Sterling or any of their
respective

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Sterling shall cause the shares of Sterling
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, Sterling shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
the employees of Hudson Valley and its Subsidiaries who continue to be
employed by Sterling or its Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) immediately following
the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), while employed by
Sterling and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, with (i) a base salary
that is no less favorable than the base salary provided by Hudson Valley or
any such Subsidiary, as applicable, to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Sterling and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that Sterling
may satisfy its obligation under Section 6.6(a)(ii) by providing such
Continuing Employees with employee benefits that are substantially similar in
the aggregate to the employee benefits provided by Hudson Valley or its
Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 



 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Sterling or its Subsidiaries
in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Sterling shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all
pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their
eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
analogous Hudson Valley Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such employee and
their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to the Effective Time under a Hudson Valley Benefit Plan (to the same
extent that such credit was given under the analogous Hudson Valley Benefit
Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all
service of such employees with Hudson Valley and its Subsidiaries for all
purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into
account under the analogous Hudson Valley Benefit Plan prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to
the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of
services, (B) for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan or benefit plan
that provides retiree welfare benefits, or (C) to any benefit plan that is a
frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.

 



 

(c) The Surviving Corporation agrees to honor in accordance with their terms
all benefits vested as of the Closing Date under the Hudson Valley Benefit
Plans.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of Hudson Valley or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Corporation, Hudson Valley, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation,
Hudson Valley, Sterling or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or
terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of
Hudson Valley or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any
reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Hudson Valley Benefit Plan, New
Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
particular Hudson Valley Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time.
Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.10, nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
person, including without limitation any current or former employee, officer,
director or consultant of Hudson Valley or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Hudson Valley and Sterling have agreed to pay the aggregate amount of stay
bonuses to certain key employees of Hudson Valley as set forth in Section
6.6(e) to the Hudson Valley Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Sterling and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director, officer or employee of Hudson Valley and its Subsidiaries (in each
case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Hudson Valley
Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out of the fact
that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Hudson Valley or
any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to the same extent as such persons are indemnified as of the date of
this Agreement by Hudson Valley pursuant to the Hudson Valley Certificate,
Hudson Valley Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of any
Subsidiary of Hudson Valley and any indemnification agreements in existence as
of the date hereof; and Sterling and the Surviving Corporation shall also
advance expenses as incurred by such Hudson Valley Indemnified Party to the
same extent as such persons are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the
date of this Agreement by Hudson Valley pursuant to the Hudson Valley
Certificate, Hudson Valleys Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents
of any Subsidiary of Hudson Valley and any indemnification agreements in
existence as of the date hereof; _provided_ , that, if required, the Hudson
Valley Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Hudson Valley
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Hudson Valley (
_provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at
or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in
excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by
Hudson Valley for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums
for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance
which, in the Surviving Corporations good faith determination, provide the
maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In
lieu of the foregoing, Hudson Valley, in consultation with, but only upon the
consent of Sterling, may (and at the request of Sterling, Hudson Valley shall
use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a
six-year "tail" policy under Hudson Valleys existing directors and officers
insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the
preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an
amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Hudson Valley Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If
the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of
its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar
transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.7.

 



 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary of
Sterling, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Hudson Valley, on the other) or
to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets,
rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the
Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and
their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Sterling.

 



 

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Sterling and Hudson Valley shall each promptly (but
in no event more than 24 hours) advise the other party of any change or event
(i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
it or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article
VII; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a
violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the party

 



      
 

 



 

failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2
or 7.3 to be satisfied.

 



 

6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Sterling and
Hudson Valley shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends
in respect of Sterling Common Stock and Hudson Valley Common Stock and the
record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that holders of Hudson Valley Common Stock shall not receive
two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to
their shares of Hudson Valley Common Stock and any shares of Sterling Common
Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

 



 

6.11 _Corporate Governance_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, Sterling shall appoint four current
members of the Board of Directors of Hudson Valley as designated by Sterling
to the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation and Sterling National
Bank.

 



 

(b) Sterling shall establish an advisory board consisting of the directors of
Hudson Valley immediately prior to the Effective Time who will not be as of
the Effective Time serving as members of the Board of Directors of the
Surviving Corporation or Sterling National Bank and who wish to serve on such
advisory board, together with any additional individuals appointed by Sterling
in its sole discretion, to monitor the performance and operations of the
Surviving Corporation in certain of Sterlings current markets. Members of
such advisory board shall be eligible to receive fees for their service on
such advisory board that are substantially similar to the fees received by
members of Hudson Valleys Business Development Board as of the date of this
Agreement, subject to such members entering into customary arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to Sterling with respect to service on such advisory
board.

 



 

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Hudson Valley agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with
any person concerning, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic
information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any
person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify such person of
the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.12(a); _provided_ , that,
prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of Hudson Valley
by the Requisite Hudson Valley Vote, in the event Hudson Valley receives an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or
cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such
negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel,
and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to
take such actions would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to
providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the
foregoing proviso, Hudson Valley shall have entered into a confidentiality
agreement with

 



       
 

 



 

such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality
Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with
any exclusive right to negotiate with Hudson Valley. Hudson Valley will, and
will cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the
date of this Agreement with any person other than Sterling with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Hudson Valley will promptly (within twenty-four (24)
hours) advise Sterling following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the
identity of the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), and will
keep Sterling apprised of any related developments, discussions and
negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of
the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. Hudson Valley shall use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill
agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance
with the terms thereof. As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ "
shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any
offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of
interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or
more of the consolidated assets of Hudson Valley and its Subsidiaries or 25%
or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Hudson Valley or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 25% of the consolidated assets of Hudson Valley, (ii) any tender offer
(including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of
equity or voting securities of Hudson Valley or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated
assets of Hudson Valley, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving Hudson Valley or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 25% of the consolidated assets of Hudson Valley.

 



 

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Hudson Valley or its
Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such
Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant
to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 



 

6.13 _Public Announcements_. Hudson Valley and Sterling shall each use their
reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan, to ensure that
all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and except in respect of any announcement required by
applicable law, or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

6.14 _Change of Method_. Hudson Valley and Sterling shall be empowered, upon
their mutual agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change the
method or structure of effecting the combination of Hudson Valley and Sterling
(including the provisions of Article I), if and to the extent they both deem
such change to be necessary, appropriate or

 



      
 

 



 

desirable; _provided_ , however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change
the Exchange Ratio or the number of shares of Sterling Common Stock received
by Hudson Valley stockholders in exchange for each share of Hudson Valley
Common Stock, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of Hudson Valleys
stockholders or Sterlings stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, (iii)
adversely affect the Tax treatment of Hudson Valley or Sterling pursuant to
this Agreement or (iv) materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. The Parties
agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this Agreement
executed by both parties in accordance with Section 8.3.

 



 

6.15 _Restructuring Efforts_. If either Hudson Valley or Sterling shall have
failed to obtain the Requisite Hudson Valley Vote or the Requisite Sterling
Vote at the duly convened Hudson Valley Meeting or Sterling Meeting, as
applicable, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties
shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a
restructuring of the transaction provided for herein (it being understood that
neither party shall have any obligation to alter or change any material terms,
including the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of
the capital stock of Hudson Valley as provided for in this Agreement, in a
manner adverse to such party or its stockholders) and/or resubmit this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant
to this Section 6.15) to its respective stockholders for adoption.

 



 

6.16 _Takeover Statutes_. None of Hudson Valley, Sterling or their respective
Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover
Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary
steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute
now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport
to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 



 

6.17 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Hudson Valley and
Sterling agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain Hudson
Valley Insiders (as defined below), both prior to and after the Effective
Time, it is desirable that Hudson Valley Insiders not be subject to a risk of
liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of
Hudson Valley Common Stock and Hudson Valley Equity Awards in the Merger, and
for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this
Section 6.17. Assuming Hudson Valley delivers to Sterling in a reasonably
timely fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate information regarding
those officers and directors of Hudson Valley subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Hudson Valley
Insiders_ "), the Board of Directors of Sterling and of Hudson Valley, or a
committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly
thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps
as may be required to

 



      
 

 



 

cause (in the case of Hudson Valley) any dispositions of Hudson Valley Common
Stock or Hudson Valley Equity Awards by the Hudson Valley Insiders, and (in
the case of Sterling) any acquisitions of Sterling Common Stock by any Hudson
Valley Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or
directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law.

if the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the

Hudson Valley if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the

Sterling, in the case of a termination by Hudson Valley, which breach or
failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other

termination by Sterling, or 7.3, in the case of a termination by Hudson
Valley, and which is not cured within 45 days following written notice to

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Sterling or Hudson
Valley as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no effect, and none of Sterling, Hudson Valley, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 6.2(b) and
this Section 8.2 and Article IX (other than Section 9.1) shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Sterling nor Hudson Valley shall
be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made known to senior management of Hudson Valley or has been made
directly to its stockholders generally or any person shall have publicly
announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Hudson
Valley and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Sterling or
Hudson Valley pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and Hudson Valley shall have failed
to obtain the Requisite Hudson Valley Vote at the duly convened Hudson Valley
Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on the
adoption of this Agreement was taken or (B) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by Sterling pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and (C) prior to the date
that is eighteen (18) months after the date of such termination, Hudson Valley
enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as
that referred to above), then Hudson Valley shall, on the earlier of the date
it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay Sterling, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to
$20,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , that for purposes of
this Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%".

 



 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Sterling pursuant to
Section 8.1(f), then Hudson Valley shall pay Sterling, by wire transfer of
same day funds, the Termination Fee on the date of termination.

 



 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Hudson Valley pursuant
to Section 8.1(e), then Sterling shall pay Hudson Valley, by wire transfer of
same day funds, the Termination Fee on the date of termination.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the other
partys willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement, in the
event that this Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 8.1, the
maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees, liabilities or damages payable by a
single party under this Agreement shall be equal to the Termination Fee.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Each of Sterling and Hudson Valley acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other
party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Sterling or Hudson
Valley fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and,
in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee,
such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party
(including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In
addition, if Sterling or Hudson Valley, as the case may be, fails to pay the
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then such party shall pay
interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate"
(as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on
the date on which such payment was required to be made for the period
commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to
be paid.

 



 

8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with Merger by the stockholders of Sterling
and Hudson Valley; _provided_ , _however_ , that after adoption of this
Agreement by the respective stockholders of Sterling or Hudson Valley, there
may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of
this Agreement that requires further approval under applicable law. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 



 

8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and waive compliance with any of the
agreements or satisfaction of any conditions contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after adoption of this Agreement by the respective
stockholders of Sterling or Hudson Valley, there may not be, without further
approval of such stockholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or
any portion thereof that requires further approval under applicable law. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of New York without regard to any applicable conflicts of law,
except to the extent federal law may be applicable. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO REQUEST A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO
THIS AGREEMENT AND REPRESENTS THAT COUNSEL HAS BEEN CONSULTED SPECIFICALLY AS
TO THIS WAIVER.

 



      
 

 



 

 **F.** ** ****_Successors and Assigns_**

 



 

This Agreement is binding upon and is for the benefit of the parties hereto

neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned
by any party hereto to any other person without the prior consent in writing
of the other party hereto.

 

 ** **

 

 **G.** ** ****_Counterparts_**

 



 

This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts (including by facsimile
or other electronic means), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 

 ** **

 

 **H.** ** ****_Entire Agreement_**

 



 

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

 ** **

 

 **I.** ** ****_Interpretation_**

 



 

The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." References to "the date hereof" shall mean the date of this
Agreement.

 

 ** **

 

 **J.** ** ****_Specific Performance_**

 



 

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and,
accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties
obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further
waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at
law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post security
or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

 ** **

 

 **K.** ** ****_Severability_**

 



 

Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under

 



      
 

 



 

applicable law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed,
construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so
broad as is enforceable.
