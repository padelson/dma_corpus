 Section 9.4 _Demands_. The Indemnified Party agrees that within 30 days after it becomes aware of facts giving rise to a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_, including receipt by it of notice of any demand, assertion, claim, action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by any third party (any such third party action being referred to herein as the "Indemnity Claim"), with respect to any matter as to which it claims to be entitled to indemnity under the provisions of this Agreement, it will provide notice thereof in writing to the Indemnifying Party specifying in reasonable detail the nature of and specific basis for such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Partys failure to provide notice under this  _Section 9.4_ will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from the liability hereunder with respect to such matter except in the event and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. Such notice shall include a formal demand for indemnification under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.5 _Right to Contest and Defend_. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled at its cost and expense to contest and defend by all appropriate legal proceedings any Indemnity Claim with respect to which it is called upon to indemnify the Indemnified Party under the provisions of this Agreement; provided, that notice of the intention to so contest shall be delivered by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within 20 days from the date of receipt by the Indemnifying Party of notice by the Indemnified Party of the assertion of the Indemnity Claim. Any such contest may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party as may be appropriate. Such contest shall be conducted by reputable counsel (in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnifying Party) employed by the Indemnifying Party and not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party, but the Indemnified Party shall have the right but not the obligation to participate in such proceedings and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at its sole cost and expense. The Indemnifying Party shall have full authority to determine all action to be taken with respect thereto; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will not have the authority to subject the Indemnified Party to any obligation whatsoever, other than the performance of purely ministerial tasks or obligations not involving material expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to contest any such Indemnity Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect to such claim by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of an Indemnity Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of an Indemnity Claim that the Indemnifying Party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with such Indemnity Claim, which fully and completely releases the Indemnified 

   ##### 

  

 

Party in connection with such Indemnity Claim and which would not otherwise
adversely affect the Indemnified Party. 

   

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Indemnity Claim (and shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending such Indemnity Claim) if the Indemnity Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the Indemnified Party which the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, upon the advice of outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages. If such equitable relief or other relief portion of the Indemnity Claim can be so separated from that for money damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money damages. 

  

 Section 9.6 _Cooperation_. The Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party with respect to all aspects of the defense of any Indemnity Claims covered by the indemnification set forth in this _Article IX_, including the prompt furnishing to the Indemnifying Party of any correspondence or other notice relating thereto that the Indemnified Party may receive, permitting the names of the Indemnified Party to be utilized in connection with such defense, the making available to the Indemnifying Party of any files, records or other information of the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party reasonably considers relevant to such defense and the making available to the Indemnifying Party of any employees of the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that in connection therewith the Indemnifying Party agrees to use reasonable efforts to minimize the impact thereof on the operations of the Indemnified Party and further agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all files, records and other information furnished by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 9.6_, unless otherwise required by Law or the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange or any other applicable exchange or quotation system. In no event shall the obligation of the Indemnified Party to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence be construed as imposing upon the Indemnified Party an obligation to hire and pay for counsel in connection with the defense of any claims covered by the indemnification set forth in this _Article IX_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may, at its own option, cost and expense, hire and pay for counsel in connection with any such defense. The Indemnifying Party agrees to keep any such counsel hired by the Indemnified Party reasonably informed as to the status of any such defense, but the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to retain sole control over such defense to the extent provided above. 

  

 Section 9.7 _Payment of Losses_. The indemnification required hereunder shall be made by monthly payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, within 30 days as and when reasonably specific bills are received or Loss is incurred and reasonable evidence thereof is delivered. In calculating any amount to be paid by an Indemnifying Party by reason of the indemnification provisions of this Agreement, the amount to be paid shall be reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds related to indemnified Losses realized by the Indemnified Party and (ii) any amounts related to indemnified Losses recovered by the Indemnified Party under contractual indemnities from third parties. 

  

 Section 9.8 _Limitations on Indemnification_. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (a) To the extent the Partnership Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification for Losses pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ (other than for Losses related to a breach of the representations and warranties in _Section 4.6_), Anadarko shall not be liable for those Losses unless the aggregate amount of Losses exceeds 1% of the sum of (i) the Cash Consideration, plus (ii) the dollar value of the Unit Consideration on the Closing Date, plus (iii) the dollar value of the GP Consideration on the Closing Date (with each general partner unit being deemed for this purpose to have the same value as a common unit) (the sum of (i), (ii) and (iii) being the "Aggregate Consideration") (the "Deductible"), and then only to the extent of any such excess. 

   

 (b) In addition, to the extent the Partnership Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification for Losses pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_, Anadarko shall not be liable for such Losses that exceed, in the aggregate, 25% of the Aggregate Consideration less the Deductible. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding _Section 9.8(a)_ and _(b)_ , to the extent the Partnership Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification for Losses pursuant to  _Section 9.3(b)_, _9.3(c)_ , _9.3(d)_ , _9.3(e),_ _9.3(f)_ or  _9.3(g)_ or for claims arising from fraud, Anadarko shall be fully liable for such Losses without respect to the Deductible in _Section 9.8(a)_ and the limitations in  _Section 9.8(b)_. 

   

 (d) To the extent the Anadarko Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification for Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_, the Partnership shall not be liable for those Losses unless the aggregate amount of Losses exceeds, in the aggregate, the Deductible, and then only to the extent of any such excess. In addition, to the extent the Anadarko Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification for Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ , the Partnership shall not be liable for such Losses that exceed, in the aggregate, 10% of the Aggregate Consideration less the Deductible. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding _Section 9.8(d)_, to the extent the Anadarko Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification for Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ or for claims arising from fraud, the Partnership shall be fully liable for such Losses without respect to the Deductible and the limitations in _Section 9.8(d)_. 

  

 Section 9.9 _Sole Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, after the Closing, this _Article IX_ contains the Anadarko Indemnified Parties and the Partnership Indemnified Parties exclusive remedy against each other with respect to breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in _Article IV_ and _Article V_ and in the covenants in this Agreement to be performed prior to Closing, in each case other than claims or causes of action arising from fraud. All references in this _Article IX_ to such breaches of such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements include any affirmation of such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the certificates delivered at Closing by the Contributing Parties pursuant to  _Section 3.2(b)_ and by the Recipient Parties pursuant to _Section 3.3(e)_. 

  

 Section 9.10 _Express Negligence Rule_. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSLY NEGOTIATED IN
