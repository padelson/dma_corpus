         Selling Subsidiary; provided further that "Assumed Liabilities" shall
         not include any obligations under any Contract required to be disclosed
         in a Schedule to this Agreement that is not so disclosed and shall not
         include any damages or other claims related to activities of the Parent
         or any Selling Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time. Except for the
         Assumed Liabilities, Purchaser will not assume or become liable for any
         other Liability (such Liabilities not assumed by the Purchaser are
         hereinafter referred to as the "RETAINED Liabilities"). Purchaser shall
         not assume or have any Liability for any conduct of the Business prior
         to the Effective Time, regardless of whether such matter is disclosed
         on any Schedule to this Agreement. Purchaser shall not assume or have
         any Liability for any legal fees or expenses of the Parent, the Selling
         Subsidiaries or any other party incurred for any reason whatsoever, and
         the Purchased Assets shall not be utilized for or reduced by the amount
         of any such fees or expenses. Purchaser shall not assume any Liability
         for federal, state or local income, sales, use, excise, payroll,
         employment or other Taxes, or for wages, salaries or overtime, vacation
         pay, holiday pay or other employee benefits, or other employee benefit

         payable prior to or subsequent to the Closing Date and relating to a
         period of time both prior to and subsequent to the Effective Time will
         be prorated as of the Effective Time between the Purchaser and the
         Parent. If the actual amount of any such item is not known as of the
         Closing Date, the aforesaid proration shall be based on the previous
         year's assessment of such item and the parties agree to adjust said
         proration and pay any underpayment or reimburse for any overpayment

                           ARTICLE 4: PURCHASE PRICE

         4.1      PURCHASE PRICE.

                  (a)      In consideration of (i) the sale, transfer,
         conveyance, assignment and delivery of the Purchased Assets, and in
         reliance upon the representations and warranties made herein by the
         Parent and the Seller and (ii) the covenants of Parent and Seller under
         the Noncompetition Agreement, at the Closing, the Purchaser shall pay
         or cause to be paid to the Parent by bank wire transfer of immediately
         available funds to an account designated in writing by the Parent an
         amount in cash equal to (i) the sum of ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-FIVE MILLION
         AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($175,000,000.00); plus (ii) the Estimated Net
         Prepayments and Inventory; (the "Initial Purchase Price"), subject to
         adjustment pursuant to SECTION 4.2 of this Agreement. The Initial
         Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to SECTION 4.2 of this Agreement is
         referred to herein as the "PURCHASE PRICE." Three Million and 00/100
         Dollars ($3,000,000.00) of the Purchase Price shall be allocated as
         payment for the covenants under the Noncompetition Agreement.

                  (b)      At or prior to the Closing, the Parent shall present
         to the Purchaser a good faith estimate of Final Net Prepayments


                                       13
<PAGE>

         and Inventory (the "Estimated Net Prepayments and Inventory"), which
         shall be based upon the books and records of the Parent and the Selling
         Subsidiaries at a reasonable time prior to Closing. Such estimate shall
         be accompanied by Parent's working papers and calculations reasonably
         necessary to support the Parent's calculation of the Estimated Net
         Prepayments and Inventory.

         4.2      PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT.

                  (a)      Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
         shall deliver to the Parent a net prepayments and inventory statement
         along with related working papers and calculations (the "Net
         Prepayments and Inventory Statement"), setting forth the Purchaser's
         calculation of Final Net Prepayments and Inventory. The Net Prepayments
         and Inventory Statement shall be delivered to the Parent in detail
         sufficient to allow the Parent to derive the Purchaser's calculation of
         Final Net Prepayments and Inventory.

                  (b)      Within 30 days following receipt by the Parent of the
         Net Prepayments and Inventory Statement, the Parent shall deliver
         written notice to the Purchaser of any dispute it has with respect to
         the preparation or content of such statement. In the event that the
         Parent does not notify the Purchaser of a dispute with respect to the
         Net Prepayments and Inventory Statement within such 30-day period, such
         Net Prepayments and Inventory Statement will be final, conclusive and
         binding on the parties and shall be deemed the finally determined Final
         Net Prepayments and Inventory. In the event of such notification of a
         dispute, the Purchaser and the Parent shall negotiate in good faith to
         resolve such dispute. If the Purchaser and the Parent fail to resolve
         such dispute within 30 days after the Parent advises the Purchaser of
         its objections, then the Purchaser and the Parent, jointly, shall
         engage a mutually agreed upon independent public accounting firm (the
         "INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING FIRM") to resolve the amount of Final Net
         Prepayments and Inventory based upon the definitions contained in this
         Agreement. All determinations made by the Independent Accounting Firm
         shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The fees and
         expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by
         the Purchaser and the Parent.

                  (c)      For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in
         this SECTION 4.2, each party shall cooperate with and make available to
         the other party and its representatives all information, records, data
         and working papers, and will permit access to its facilities and
         personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection with the
         preparation and analysis of the Net Prepayments and Inventory Statement
         and the resolution of any disputes thereunder.

                  (d)      The Initial Purchase Price will be adjusted upward or
         downward by an amount that is the amount by which the Final Net
         Prepayments and Inventory (as finally determined pursuant to SECTION
         4.2(B)) is greater than or less than the Estimated Net Prepayments and
         Inventory. If the Final Net Prepayments and Inventory is less than the
         Estimated Net Prepayments and Inventory, the Parent shall pay or cause
         to be paid to the Purchaser, by bank wire transfer of immediately
         available funds to an account designated in writing by the Purchaser,
         an amount in cash equal to the Estimated Net Prepayments and Inventory
         less the Final Net Prepayments and Inventory. If the Final Net
         Prepayments and Inventory is greater than the Estimated Net Prepayments
         and Inventory,


                                       14
<PAGE>

         the Purchaser shall pay to the Parent by bank wire transfer of
         immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
         Parent, an amount equal to the Final Net Prepayments and Inventory less
         the Estimated Net Prepayments and Inventory. Any payments made under
         this SECTION 4.2(D) (i) shall accrue interest from the Closing Date at
         a rate per annum equal to 5% and shall be made within 5 business days
         from the date on which the Final Net Prepayments and Inventory is
         finally determined pursuant to SECTION 4.2(B) and (ii) are not subject
         to the Basket.

         4.3      NON-QUALIFIED INVENTORY PAYMENT. For purposes of SECTION
4.1(B), the Estimated Net Prepayments and Inventory shall not include the
Inventory Value of any Non-qualified Inventory. For purposes of SECTION 4.2, the
Final Net Prepayments and Inventory shall only include the Inventory Value of
Non-qualified Inventory that is disposed of by Purchaser prior to the time the
Final Net Prepayments and Inventory is finally determined. Purchaser shall pay
Parent the Inventory Value of any Non-qualified Inventory that is disposed of
after the Final Net Prepayments and Inventory is finally determined within 30
business days from the date of such disposal.

         4.4      SYSCO MARKET ACCESS FEE. As part of the Prepaid Expenses and
Deposits, Purchaser will acquire the remaining prepaid amount of market access
fee under the Sysco letter agreements described on SCHEDULE 6.11(A).
Additionally, as part of the Accounts Payable, Purchaser will assume the
remaining payment obligations under such letter agreements with Sysco, which are
as of the date of this Agreement and will remain $3,000,000 until June 15, 2003.
Such acquisition and assumption will be included in the calculation of the
Estimated Net Prepayments and Inventory and Final Net Prepayments and Inventory.
In the event such letter agreements are terminated and Sysco does not refund in
full to Purchaser the remaining portion of the prepaid market access fee, Parent
and Seller shall pay Purchaser such unrefunded amounts; provided, however, that
Parent and Seller will not pay for any amount that is not refunded due to an
actual breach by Purchaser of its obligations under such letter agreements or
any amount that is not refunded due to Purchaser entering into a new or
substitute arrangement with Sysco. Upon Parent and Seller's payment to
Purchaser, they shall be entitled to pursue all of Purchaser's rights to such
repayment from Sysco, and Purchaser agrees to cooperate and assist Parent and
Seller, as reasonably requested, in their efforts to collect such sums from
Sysco.

         The Parent and the Seller jointly and severally represent and warrant
to, and for the benefit of, the Purchaser, as of the date of this Agreement and
solely with respect to the Business, as follows:

         6.1      ORGANIZATION AND STANDING. Each of the Parent and each Selling
Subsidiary is a limited liability company or corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of organization as set
forth on SCHEDULE 6.1. Each Selling Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to
do business as a foreign limited liability company or foreign corporation and is
in good standing as a foreign limited liability company or foreign corporation
in each jurisdiction where the properties used in the Business are owned, leased
or operated, or where the Business is conducted, and which requires such
licensing, good standing or qualification, except where such failure to so
license, qualify or be in such good standing, is not


                                       18
<PAGE>

reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Parent and each
Selling Subsidiary has full power and authority to carry on the Business as it
is now being conducted. The Parent has made available (or caused to be made
available) to the Purchaser a complete and correct copy of the Parent's and each
Selling Subsidiary's Organizational Documents. The Parent does not have,
directly or through any subsidiary, any operations for the manufacture,
distribution, marketing and sale of frozen desserts other than the Business.

         6.2      AUTHORITY; CONFLICTS; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

                  (a)      Each of the Parent and each Selling Subsidiary has
         the power and authority and has taken all action necessary in order to
         execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to consummate the
         transactions contemplated herein. This Agreement has been duly
         authorized, executed and delivered by each of the Parent and the Seller
         and constitutes (assuming the valid authorization, execution and

         Course of Business, and such assets, taken as a whole, are suitable for

         Subsidiary has the right to transfer, or to cause the transfer of, the
         Business Intellectual Property contemplated by this Agreement. SCHEDULE
         6.9 specifically identifies (A) all Business Intellectual Property
         which has been licensed to third Persons, and (B) all Contracts (except
         for commercially available over-the-counter "shrink wrap" software and

                  (c)      The documentation relating to the Product Formulas is
         current, accurate and sufficient in detail and content so as to enable
         them to be used without reliance on the knowledge or memory of any
         individual. Except as otherwise set forth in SCHEDULE 6.9, the Parent
         or a Selling Subsidiary has taken all reasonable precautions to
         maintain the secrecy, confidentiality and value of all Business
         Intellectual Property consisting of trade secrets in accordance with
         procedures customarily used in the industry of the Parent and the
         Selling Subsidiaries to protect rights of like importance. Parent has
         no Knowledge that any purported trade secret or other proprietary
         information is part of the public knowledge or literature, or that any
         purported trade secret or other proprietary information has been
         improperly divulged or improperly appropriated either for the benefit
         of any Person other than the Parent or a Selling Subsidiary or to the
         detriment of the Parent or any Selling Subsidiary.

                  (d)      Parent or the applicable Selling Subsidiary has used
         reasonable efforts to mark all usages of registered Trademarks with the
         correct marking required or desirable to maximize available damages
         awards.

                  (e)      The Parent or the applicable Selling Subsidiary has
         taken all action necessary and required to protect the Business
         Intellectual Property except as set forth in SCHEDULE 6.9 with respect
         to the lack of current use of certain Trademarks in certain
         jurisdictions.

                  (f)      All licenses to the Parent or a Selling Subsidiary,
         or any combination of the foregoing, of Business Intellectual Property
         and, except as set forth in SCHEDULE 6.9 with respect to the lack of
         current use of certain Trademarks in certain jurisdictions, all


                                       23
<PAGE>
         registered Business Intellectual Property rights are valid and
         enforceable and Parent has no Knowledge, and neither Parent nor any
         Selling Subsidiary has received notice from any Person asserting, that
         any of the same are invalid or not enforceable. Except as specifically
         set forth in SCHEDULE 6.9 with respect to the lack of current use of
         certain Trademarks in certain jurisdictions, all unregistered
         Trademarks listed on SCHEDULE 6.9 are valid and enforceable and Parent
         has no Knowledge, and neither Parent nor any Selling Subsidiary has
         received notice from any Person asserting, that any of the same are
         invalid or not enforceable. Parent has no Knowledge, and neither Parent
         nor any Selling Subsidiary has received notice from any Person
         asserting, that any of the Business Intellectual Property consisting of
         registerable unregistered copyrights is invalid or not enforceable. To
         the Knowledge of Parent, the Business Intellectual Property has not
         been infringed, misappropriated or violated by other Persons. Except as
         may be indicated in SCHEDULE 6.9, no claims or allegations have been
         asserted or threatened in writing or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
         threatened orally by any Person, that remain unresolved against the
         Parent or any Selling Subsidiary to the effect that use by the Parent
         or any Selling Subsidiary of any of the Business Intellectual Property
         with respect to the Business infringes upon, violates or constitutes a
         misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of any third
         Person. The use of the Business Intellectual Property by the Parent or
         the Selling Subsidiaries does not infringe, constitute a
         misappropriation of, or otherwise violate any intellectual property
         right of any third Person, except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 6.9. Without
         limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth in
         SCHEDULE 6.9 with respect to the lack of current use of certain
         Trademarks in certain jurisdictions, all registered Business
         Intellectual Property rights are in full force and effect and all
         actions required to keep such rights pending or in effect or to provide
         full available protection, including payment of filing, examination,
         annuity, and maintenance fees and filing of renewals, statements of use
         or working, affidavits of incontestability and other similar actions,
         have been taken. Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 6.9, neither the
         Parent nor any Selling Subsidiary has received any written notice that
         any registered Business Intellectual Property right is the subject of
         any interference, opposition, cancellation, nullity, re-examination or
         other proceeding placing in question the validity or scope of such
         rights.

         6.10     LITIGATION. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 6.10, (i) there is
no Action or Order by which the Parent or any Selling Subsidiary or any of the
Purchased Assets is subject or bound, pertaining to the Business, pending, or to
the Knowledge of the Parent, threatened against the Parent or any Selling
Subsidiary or any of the Purchased Assets.

                  Purchaser represents and warrants to, and for the benefit of,

         consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereunder, nor
         compliance with or fulfillment of the terms, conditions and provisions
         hereof, will conflict with, result in a breach of the terms,
         conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default, an event of

<PAGE>

         Purchaser from, any Person or any Governmental Body, in connection
         with the execution or delivery of this Agreement by the Purchaser, the
         performance by the Purchaser of its obligations hereunder or the
         consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         7.3      NO PROCEEDING. As of the date hereof, there is no Action

legality or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         7.4      NO FINDERS OR BROKERS. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 7.4,

                ARTICLE 8: PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

                  The respective parties hereto covenant and agree to take the
following actions between the date hereof and the Closing Date set forth
hereinbelow.

         8.1      ACCESS TO INFORMATION. Subject to applicable Law and the
Confidentiality Agreement, the officers, employees and authorized
representatives of the Purchaser (including, without limitation, independent
public accountants, financial advisors and attorneys) shall have reasonable
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to the
offices, properties, employees and business and financial records of the Parent
and each Selling Subsidiary which relate to the Business (including for the
purpose of making Phase I or Phase II environmental assessments), and the
Parent shall furnish (or caused to be furnished) to the Purchaser or its
authorized representatives such additional information concerning the Business
as shall be reasonably requested by the Purchaser; provided, however, that
neither the Parent nor any Selling Subsidiary shall be required to violate any
obligation of confidentiality to which it is subject in discharging its
obligations pursuant to this SECTION 8.1. The Purchaser agrees that such
investigation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the operations of the Parent or any Selling Subsidiary.
Purchaser shall have the right to have a representative reasonably acceptable
to Parent on the premises of Foil, Spartanburg, Stilwell and the Suwanee Real
Property during normal business hours. Such representative shall be on the

instructions or directions to any employee. Such representative shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.


                                      34
<PAGE>

         8.2      PUBLICITY. No party to this Agreement, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, agents or representatives, shall communicate with any
other Person with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. The
initial press release announcing the transactions contemplated herein shall be
mutually agreed upon among the parties and released jointly, except as may be
required by Law. Thereafter, except for customary press releases and formal
communications by the Parent and each Selling Subsidiary to employees,
shareholders, customers or suppliers (other than with respect to the transition
of employment) and except for the process of making offers of employment and
accepting employment applications pursuant to SECTION 8.9 hereof, the parties
hereto shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or
otherwise making any public or other announcements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and prior to making any filings with any
Governmental Body or with any national securities exchange with respect
thereto, except as may be required by Law.

         8.3      CERTAIN NOTIFICATIONS. Each party shall promptly notify the
other of any Action that shall be instituted or threatened against such party
to restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the
other of any lawsuit, claim, proceeding or investigation that may be
threatened, brought, asserted or commenced against the Parent, any Selling
Subsidiary or the Purchaser, as the case may be, that would have been required
to be listed in SCHEDULE 6.10 or constitute an exception to SECTION 7.3, as the
case may be, if such lawsuit, claim, proceeding or investigation had arisen
prior to the date hereof. The Parent will promptly notify the Purchaser of any
material adverse change in the Business or the commencement or threat of any
material Action.

         8.4      REQUIRED APPROVALS.

                  (a)      Other than with respect to the HSR Act, each party
         hereto hereby agrees to cooperate with the other, and use its
         commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all
         necessary documentation, to effect all necessary applications,
         notices, petitions, filings and other documents. The Parent hereby
         agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as
         promptly as practicable all necessary permits, consents, approvals and
         authorizations of all Persons and Governmental Bodies, including,
         without limitation, the consents, approvals and authorizations set
         forth on SCHEDULES 6.2, 6.3 and 10.1(D) that are required for the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and to permit all
         of the Contracts to be assigned to the Purchaser and otherwise assure
         that the Purchaser will be able to operate the Business and enjoy the
         benefits of all Contracts as they presently exist. Except with respect
         to filings or written materials submitted pursuant to SECTION 8.5,
         each party shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the
         extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case
         subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and any applicable Laws
         relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating
         to the other party that appears in any filing made with, or written
         materials submitted to, all third parties and Governmental Bodies in
         connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In
         exercising the foregoing right, the Purchaser, the Parent and the
         Seller shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The
         Purchaser, the Parent and the Seller agree that they will keep the
         other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
         transactions


                                      35
<PAGE>

         contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with
         copies of notices or other communications received from all third
         parties, including any Governmental Bodies, with respect to the
         transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes hereof "commercially
         reasonable efforts" means the efforts that a prudent person desirous
         of achieving a result would use in similar circumstances to ensure
         that such results is achieved as promptly as practicable, but
         "commercially reasonable efforts" do not require that a party make any
         payment or undertake any continuing obligation (except for obligations
         already existing under contracts or agreements being assumed) in order
         to obtain any applicable consent, approval or authorization, except as
         provided in next sentence or in Section 8.5(a). Notwithstanding the
         preceding sentence, for purposes of obtaining consents, approvals and
         authorizations (other than from Governmental Bodies or from Sysco),
         Parent and Seller shall make payments necessary to obtain such other
         consents, approvals or authorizations up to aggregate costs of
         $3,000,000 in addition to the pay off amounts of any capital and
         operating leases, but they shall not be required to make payments in
         excess of such amount.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
         in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, this Agreement shall not
         constitute an agreement to assign any of the Contracts if the
         attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of the third party
         thereto, would constitute a breach thereof or in any way negatively
         affect the rights of the Parent, any of the Selling Subsidiaries or
         the Purchaser, as the assignee of such Contract, as the case may be,
         thereunder; provided, that this SECTION 8.4(B) shall in no way limit
         SECTIONS 9.1, ARTICLE 10 or SECTION 12.2.

         8.5      HSR ACT.

                  (a)      The Purchaser and the Parent each agree to use
         commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file the Notification
         and Report Form required pursuant to the HSR Act with the FTC and the
         Antitrust Division by no later than the fifth (5th) business day
         following the date hereof. Each such party hereby covenants to request
         early termination of the waiting period required by the HSR Act, to
         furnish to the other party hereto such necessary or appropriate
         information and reasonable assistance as such other party may
         reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary
         filings and submissions pursuant to the HSR Act and to comply with any
         requests for additional information issued by the FTC, the Antitrust
         Division, as the case may be, as promptly as practicable, including,
         without limitation, responses to "second requests." The Purchaser
         shall pay the HSR Act filing fee.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding SECTION 8.5(A), nothing in this
         Agreement shall require the Purchaser to refrain from purchasing or to
         divest a material amount of the Purchased Assets or to divest any of
         the Purchaser's other current business operations pursuant to a
         condition imposed by the Antitrust Division or the FTC as a
         prerequisite to refraining from challenging the transactions
         contemplated hereunder. In the event that the Purchaser purchases less
         than all of the Purchased Assets in accordance with such a
         requirement, or is required by the Antitrust Division or the FTC to
         divest a portion of the Purchased Assets, there will be an equitable
         adjustment to the Purchase Price. Furthermore, nothing in this
         Agreement shall require Purchaser meet any other condition


                                      36
<PAGE>

         imposed by the Antitrust Division or the FTC in order to obtain
         approval such as entering into licensing agreements or co-branding
         with third parties.

         8.6      OPERATIONS PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE.

                  (a)      The Parent shall cause each Selling Subsidiary to
         (i) use reasonable efforts to operate and carry on the Business in the
         Ordinary Course of Business and (ii) use its reasonable efforts,
         consistent with good business practice, to preserve intact the
         Business and the goodwill of the suppliers, contractors, employees,
         customers and others having business relations with it with respect to
         the Business.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding SECTION 8.6(A), except as expressly
         contemplated by this Agreement or except with the express written
         approval of the Purchaser (which the Purchaser agrees shall not be
         unreasonably withheld or delayed), neither the Parent nor any Selling
         Subsidiary shall, except as allowed on SCHEDULE 8.6:

                           (i)      other than is required pursuant to a Law,
                  or otherwise if outside of the control of the Parent or any
                  Selling Subsidiary, take or allow to occur any action listed
                  in subparagraph (a) through (m) of SECTION 6.16 or that would
                  cause any representation or warranty to be untrue at the
                  Closing;

                           (ii)     enter into any contract, agreement,
                  undertaking or commitment which would have been a Material
                  Contract if in effect on the date hereof or amend or modify
                  any Material Contract other than Contracts with existing
                  vendors (other than for capital items) or customers in the
                  Ordinary Course of Business or new vendors or customers so
                  long as the amount for any one vendor or customer does not
                  exceed $100,000 in the aggregate; or

                           (iii)    establish, introduce, or manufacture any
                  product that would constitute a new or promotional SKU.

                  (c)      The Parent will (A) confer on a regular and frequent
         basis with representatives of the Purchaser to report operational
         matters and the general status of ongoing operations as reasonably
         requested by the Purchaser and (B) not take any action that would
         render, or which reasonably may be expected to render, any
         representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement untrue at the
         Closing.

                  (d)      In addition to the requirements of Section 8.6(a),
         Parent and the Selling Subsidiaries shall not use extraordinary
         selling efforts in the Business that would have the effect of
         accelerating sales of the Business prior to the time reasonably
         expected, through offering of discounts, shipment of goods prior to
         anticipated shipping dates or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing
         and SECTION 8.6(A), Parent and the Selling Subsidiaries may manage
         their production of Inventory to allow Qualified Inventory not to
         exceed the Maximum Qualified Inventory, the SKU Quantity Limit and the
         SKU Life Limitation as of the Closing Date.


                                      37
<PAGE>

                  (e)      Parent and the Selling Subsidiaries shall use their
         commercially reasonable efforts to secure the execution by Keebler
         Company of that certain Supply Agreement with Foil dated as of
         November 19, 2002.

         8.7      CERTAIN TAX MATTERS.

                  (a)      Any sales, use, transfer, vehicle transfer, stamp,
         conveyance, value added or other similar Taxes that may be imposed by
         any Governmental Body, and all recording or filing fees, notarial fees
         and other similar costs of Closing with respect to the purchase and
         sale of the Purchased Assets, or otherwise on account of this
         Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be shared by
         the Parent and the Purchaser as follows: (i) the Parent shall pay all
         such Taxes, fees and costs up to an aggregate amount of $62,500; and
         (ii) the balance of such Taxes, fees and costs shall be shared equally
         by the Parent and the Purchaser.

                  (b)      The Parent and the Purchaser will (i) each provide
         the other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any
         of them in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, audit or
         other examination by any taxing authority or judicial or
         administrative proceedings relating to liability for Taxes, (ii) each
         retain and provide the other with any records or other information
         that may be relevant to such Tax Return, audit or examination,
         proceeding or determination, and (iii) each provide the other with any
         final determination of any such audit or examination, proceeding or
         determination that affects any amount required to be shown on any Tax
         Return of the other for any period.

         8.8      EMPLOYEES.

                  (a)      Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 8.8(A), the
         Purchaser agrees, subject to its normal employment practices, to offer
         employment to, as of the Closing Date: (i) all full time regular
         employees at the Freezer or that are employed by Stilwell, Spartanburg
         or Foil and either actively at work or on vacation on the Closing Date
         and (ii) any full time regular employee of Stilwell or Spartanburg who
         is on leave of absence, ill or otherwise not actively at work on the
         Closing Date once the Purchaser has been notified that such employee
         is willing and able to work for the Purchaser (collectively, the
         "Manufacturing Employees"), at substantially the same salary and wages
         as their current employment with Stilwell or Spartanburg, as the case
         may be. The Purchaser shall offer to the Manufacturing Employees
         health and welfare benefits that are substantially equivalent to those
         benefits offered to other employees of the Purchaser in similar
         positions.

                  (b)      The Parent and the Seller agree that following the
         execution of this Agreement and continuing after the Closing Date, the
         Purchaser shall be allowed to discuss with the Manufacturing Employees
         and the Administrative Employees the terms of employment to be offered
         by the Purchaser. The Parent and the Seller covenant not to interfere
         (and shall cause each Selling Subsidiary not to interfere) with any
         such efforts by the Purchaser and to use their commercially reasonable
         efforts to assist the Purchaser in employing the Manufacturing
         Employees. The Parent shall promptly after the Closing


                                      38

         Date pay the cash equivalent of all accrued wages and salaries,
         accrued paid time off, sick leave, vacations or similar benefits of
         each employee hired by the Purchaser.

                  (c)      The Purchaser, in its sole discretion, may offer

         shall be solely responsible and liable for any obligations,
         liabilities or Actions which may be asserted against or imposed

                  (f)      Prior to the date hereof, the Parent and the

         the delivery of such announcement. The parties will deliver such
         announcement to employees of the Business in accordance with such
         communication plan. With respect to all other announcements to
         employees, neither the Seller nor Affiliates shall distribute

Title Policies and the Surveys. The Purchaser shall reimburse the Parent for
one-half the cost of the Title Policies and the Surveys at the Closing. The
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for obtaining at its sole cost and
expense, in the event the Purchaser elects to do so, any extended coverage with
respect to the Title Policies or any endorsements to the Title Policies.

         based upon purchases made both before and after the Closing Date, the

         standard cost or market using the FIFO Method (without any provision
         for reserves) on a monthly basis. As to any such goods that are
         Non-qualified Inventory if such goods had been returned on the Closing
         Date, the Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
         dispose of such returned goods in the secondary market and shall remit
         the proceeds thereof to Parent, less reasonable costs of disposition,
         on a monthly basis.

                  (c)      Purchaser hereby grants to each of the Parent and
         its Affiliates a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free right
         and license to use the Trademarks for the sole purpose of depleting
         the existing packaging inventory of the Retained Assets that use the
         Trademarks; provided, that such license shall automatically terminate
         on the date that is one year from the Closing.

         the representations and warranties of the Purchaser contained in this
         Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the

<PAGE>

                  (a)      by mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the
         Parent;

                  (b)      by the Parent by written notice to the Purchaser
         delivered after 180 days from the date hereof if the Closing shall not
         have been consummated on or prior to such date; or

                  (c)      by the Purchaser by written notice to the Parent
         delivered after 180 days from the date hereof if the Closing shall not
         have been consummated on or prior to such date.

         11.2     EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

                  (a)      The right of termination under SECTION 11.1(A)
         hereof is in addition to any other rights the Purchaser or the Parent
         may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of a
         right of termination shall not be an election of remedies and shall
         not preclude an action for breach of this Agreement. In the event of a
         termination of this Agreement pursuant to SECTION 11.1 hereof, each
         party shall pay the expenses incurred by it in connection with the
         Agreement and, except as set forth in SECTION 13.7(B), no party shall
         have any liability or obligation to any other party to this Agreement
         under or in connection with this Agreement; provided, however, that
         nothing in this Agreement will relieve any party from liability for
         any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination; provided
         further, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by a party
         because of the breach of this Agreement by the other party or because
         one or more of the conditions to the terminating party's obligations
         under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the other party's
         failure to comply in all material respects with its obligations under
         this Agreement, the terminating party's rights to pursue all legal
         remedies will survive such termination unimpaired.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement,
         the obligations of the parties with respect to SECTION 8.2
         (Publicity), SECTION 13.7 (Expenses), SECTION 13.11 (Governing Law)
         and as set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive.

                          ARTICLE 12: INDEMNIFICATION

         12.1     SURVIVAL. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of
this Agreement, all of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the parties hereto shall survive the Closing and shall remain in
full force and effect except to the extent the Parent and the Seller on the one
hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, waives any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in writing at or prior to Closing.

or any certificate, affidavit or instrument


                                      45

delivered pursuant hereto including but not limited to any certificate,
affidavit or instrument delivered pursuant to SECTION 5.2; (b) the Retained
Liabilities; (c) Environmental Laws to the extent relating to matters existing
or actions taken prior to the Closing; (d) Taxes (excluding sales, use,
transfer, vehicle transfer, stamp, conveyance, value added or other similar
Taxes that may be imposed by any Governmental Body in connection with the

but shall be treated as set forth in SECTION 8.7(A)); (e) the failure of the
Purchaser to receive good and marketable title to all of the Purchased Assets,
including equipment underlying the Capital Leases; (f) the failure of the
Parent and the Seller to obtain any material consent, approval, acknowledgement
or waiver; (g) the use and sale by the Purchaser of the Inventory; (h) the

use or possession of the Purchased Assets in the manner they are used on the
Closing Date by virtue of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,308,633 or 5,244,347; (j) the
failure, if any, to obtain good and sufficient title to U.S. Trademark No.
653,166; (k) any infringement resulting from the use of the name "flip it"; or
(l) the failure to obtain licenses for branded product ingredients. The
Purchaser shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Parent and the Seller
and its respective officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates from
and against any and all Losses actually sustained by any of such Persons
resulting from (a) any inaccuracies in or any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement
(including any Schedule attached hereto) or any certificate, affidavit or
instrument delivered pursuant hereto; (b) any of the Assumed Liabilities; and
(c) any Liability resulting from the operation of the Business by the Purchaser
after the Effective Time.

         12.3     NOTICE AND OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND.

                  (a)      Notice of Asserted Liability. As soon as is
         reasonably practicable after the Parent or the Seller, on the one
         hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, becomes aware of any claim
         that it has or they have under SECTION 12.2 hereof that may result in
         a Loss (a "LIABILITY CLAIM"), such party (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY")
         shall give notice thereof (a "CLAIMS NOTICE") to the other party (the
         "INDEMNIFYING PARTY"). A Claims Notice shall describe the Liability
         Claim in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated,
         if necessary and to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or
         may be suffered by the Indemnified Party. No delay in or failure to
         give a Claims Notice by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying
         Party pursuant to this SECTION 12.3(A) shall adversely affect any of
         the other rights or remedies which the Indemnified Party has under
         this Agreement, or alter or relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
         obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent that such
         delay or failure has not prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

                  (b)      Opportunity to Defend. The Indemnifying Party shall
         have the right, exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party
         within 30 days of receipt of a Claims Notice from the Indemnified
         Party of the commencement or assertion of any Liability Claim by a
         third party (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM") in respect of which indemnity may
         be sought hereunder, to assume and conduct the defense of such Third
         Party Claim in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement
         with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably
         satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does
         not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance


                                      46
<PAGE>

         with this SECTION 12.3(B), the Indemnified Party may continue to
         defend the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed
         the defense of a Third Party Claim as provided in this SECTION
         12.3(B), the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any legal
         expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
         with the defense thereof. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified
         Party, as the case may be, has the right to participate in (but not
         control), at its own expense, the defense of any Third Party Claim
         that the other is defending as provided in this Agreement. The
         Indemnifying Party, if it shall have assumed the defense of any Third
         Party Claim as provided in this Agreement, shall not, without the
         prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall
         not be unreasonably withheld), consent to a settlement of, or the
         entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Claim which
         (i) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
         the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party a complete
         release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, or
         (ii) grants any injunctive or equitable relief. The Indemnified Party
         shall not settle any Third Party Claim, without the prior written
         consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
         unreasonably withheld.

         12.4     SURVIVABILITY; LIMITATIONS.

                  (a)      The representations and warranties of the Parent and
         the Seller contained in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement
         shall survive for a period of 18 months following the Closing Date
         (the "Expiration Date") following which date no Liability Claim may be
         brought thereon; provided, however, that (i) the Expiration Date for
         any Liability Claim relating to a breach or violation of the
         representations and warranties set forth in SECTION 6.6 (Taxes) shall
         be the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; and (ii)
         any Liability Claim pending on any Expiration Date for which a Claims
         Notice has been given in accordance with SECTION 12.3(A) on or before
         such Expiration Date may continue to be asserted and indemnified
         against until finally resolved.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
         in this ARTICLE 12, neither the Parent nor the Seller shall have any
         liability under SECTION 12.2 in respect of (i) inaccuracies in or any
         breach of any representation or warranty contained in ARTICLE 6 or
         (ii) any Third Party Claims relating to the operation of the Business
         prior to the Closing Date made after the Closing Date, until the
         aggregate amount of all Losses sustained by the Purchaser exceeds
         $1,250,000 (the "Basket"), in which case the Parent and the Seller
         shall be jointly and severally liable only for any Losses exceeding
         the Basket, subject to the Cap set forth in SECTION 12.3(C) hereof;
         provided, however, that, this SECTION 12.4(B) shall not apply to, and
         the Parent and the Seller shall be jointly and severally liable (i)
         for any and all Losses of the Purchaser under SECTION 12.2(C) and
         SECTION 12.2(D); (ii) in respect of any inaccuracies in or breach of
         the representations and warranties contained in SECTIONS 6.7(D) and
         6.7(G).

                  (c)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
         in this ARTICLE 12, the maximum amount of liability for which the
         Parent and the Seller shall be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser
         pursuant to SECTION 12.2 of this Agreement shall not exceed the sum of
         $70,000,000 in the aggregate (the "Cap") and no Liability Claim shall
         be made for any additional indemnification once the Cap has been
         reached; provided, however, that


                                      47
<PAGE>

         this SECTION 12.4(C) shall not apply to, and the Parent and the Seller
         shall be jointly and severally liable for, any and all Losses of the
         Purchaser under SECTION 12.2(C) and SECTION 12.2(D) and in respect of
         any inaccuracies in or breach of the representations and warranties
         contained in SECTIONS 6.7(D) and 6.7(G).

                  (d)      Any party seeking indemnification for any damages
         for which it is entitled to seek indemnification under this ARTICLE 12
         shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its damages
         in connection with such indemnity claim.

                  (e)      The Purchaser shall not be entitled to
         indemnification under SECTION 12.2 to the extent (i) any Loss is
         covered by insurance proceeds received by the Purchaser provided,
         however, that this clause (i) shall not apply if it conflicts with
         Purchaser's obligation to cooperate with its insurers and, provided
         further, that this clause (i) does not constitute any waiver of
         subrogation; (ii) the Purchaser receives indemnification payments from
         a third party for a Loss; or (iii) any Loss arises out of the
         termination of any employee of the Purchaser after the Closing Date,
         except where such termination is due to actions, omissions or facts
         existing prior to Closing. The amount of any recovery by the Purchaser
         pursuant to SECTION 12.2 shall be net of the present value (computed
         at the time that any such indemnification recovery is made using a
         discount rate of six percent (6%) per annum) of any income Tax
         benefits inuring to the Purchaser as the result of the state of facts
         which entitle the Purchaser to such recovery under SECTION 12.2 and of
         any income tax burdens to which the Purchaser will be subject as a
         result of such recovery (taking into account the timing differences in
         the realization of any such benefits), with such benefits calculated
         using the then-effective consolidated federal income tax rate of the
         Purchaser. The Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that the
         payment of any indemnification amounts to the Purchaser pursuant to
         this ARTICLE 12 shall be deemed to be an equivalent reduction in the
         Purchase Price to be appropriately allocated among the Purchased
         Assets in accordance with SECTION 4.3.

         12.5     EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Following the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy, other than with respect to claims involving intentional
misrepresentation or fraud and the covenants set forth in ARTICLE 9, for the
Parent and the Seller or the Purchaser for any claim (whether such claim is
framed in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of any inaccuracy in or any
breach of any covenant, representation or warranty shall be a claim by the
Parent and the Seller or the Purchaser for indemnification pursuant to this
ARTICLE 12. Prior to or in connection with the Closing, and with regard to the
covenants set forth in ARTICLE 9, the parties will have available to them all
remedies available under Law, including specific performance or other equitable
remedies.

         12.6     EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. Notwithstanding any other
provision herein to the contrary, no party shall have any liability under this
Agreement, for exemplary or punitive damages as a result of a breach of this
Agreement; provided an Indemnified Party shall have the right to recover
exemplary or punitive damages imposed on it pursuant to a Third Party Claim.

         13.3     SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The rights of either party under this
Agreement shall not be assignable by such party hereto prior to the Closing
without the written consent of the other party, except that the Purchaser may
assign its right to close under this Agreement and to enter into the agreements
to be delivered upon Closing to one or several subsidiaries of the Purchaser,
so long as it remains responsible for the performance of all of its obligations
under this Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon any Person, other than the parties and successors and
assigns permitted by this SECTION 13.3, any right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement.

         13.4     ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENTS. This Agreement and the
Schedules referred to herein, the Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality
Agreement contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard to
the subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all other prior
agreements, understandings or letters of intent between or among any of the
parties hereto. This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented
except by a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each
of the parties hereto.

         13.5     INTERPRETATION.

                  (a)      Articles, titles and headings to Sections herein are
         inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be
         a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
         Agreement.

                  (b)      The Schedules referred to herein shall be construed
         with and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as
         if they were set forth verbatim herein. The Schedules correspond to
         the applicable sections of this Agreement. A Schedule relates only to
         the representations and warranties in the related section of this
         Agreement to which it corresponds and not to any other representation
         or warranty in this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency
         between the statement in this Agreement and statements in a Schedule,
         the statements in this Agreement shall control and the statements in a
         Schedule shall be disregarded.

                  (c)      Neither the specification of any dollar amount in
         any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the
         inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to
         imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so
         included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall
         use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion
         of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as
         to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or
         included in any Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
         Agreement.

                  (d)      Unless this Agreement specifically provides
         otherwise, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
         representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the
         inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to
         imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are
         not in the Ordinary Course of Business, and no party shall use the
         fact of the setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter
         in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
         obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in any
         Schedule is or is not in the Ordinary Course of Business for purposes
         of this Agreement.

                  (e)      The Seller may, from time to time prior to or at the
         Closing, by notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
         supplement, amend or create any Schedule, in order to add information
         or correct previously supplied information. No such amendment shall be
         evidence, in and of itself, that the representations and warranties in
         the corresponding section were not true and correct in all material
         respects as of the date of this Agreement. It is specifically agreed
         that such Schedules may be amended to add immaterial, as well as
         material, items thereto. However, any such supplement, amendment or
         addition shall not be effective to cure or correct any breach of any
         representation, warranty or covenant which would have existed if
         Seller had not made such supplement, amendment or addition, and all
         references to any Schedule hereto which is supplemented or amended as
         provided in this SECTION 13.5 shall for all purposes be deemed to be a
         reference to such Schedule as originally delivered.

                  (f)      The parties intend that each representation,
         warranty and agreement contained in this Agreement will have
         independent significance. If any party has breached any
         representation, warranty or agreement in any respect, the fact that
         there exists another representation, warranty or agreement relating to
         the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of
         specificity) that the party has not breached will not detract from or
         mitigate the fact that the party is in breach of the first
         representation, warranty or agreement. Any reference to any federal,
         state, local or foreign Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules
         and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
         otherwise. The word "including" shall mean "including, without
         limitation." The use of the masculine, feminine or neuter gender or
         the singular or plural form of words will not limit any provisions of
         this Agreement. A statement that an item is listed, disclosed or
         described means that such item is correctly listed, disclosed or
         described, and a statement that a copy of an item has been delivered
         means a true and correct copy of such item has been delivered. Any
         accounting term used in this Agreement and not defined shall have the
         meaning accorded to it under GAAP.


                                      51
<PAGE>

                  (g)      Delivery of documents at the Closing shall not imply
         that the deliveries vary the terms of this Agreement.

         13.6     WAIVERS. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or
parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party,
it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The
failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any
way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of
any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any
breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach.

         13.7     EXPENSES. Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this
Agreement, each party hereto will pay all costs and expenses incident to its
negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and to its performance and
compliance with all agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to
be performed or complied with, including, without limitation, the fees,
expenses and disbursements of its counsel and independent public accountants.

         13.8     PARTIAL INVALIDITY. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating
the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions
or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be
unreasonable.

         13.9     EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original
instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties hereto and delivered to the Seller and the Purchaser.

         13.10    FURTHER ASSURANCES. On and after the Closing Date each party
hereto shall take such other actions and execute such other documents and
instruments of conveyance and transfer as may be reasonably requested by the
other party hereto from time to time to effectuate or consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

         13.11    GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflicts of
law provisions) of the State of Delaware.

         13.12    SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Each of the parties acknowledges and
agrees that the subject matter of this Agreement, including the business,
assets and properties of the Business, is unique, that the other parties would
be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are
breached, and that the remedies at law would not be adequate to compensate such
other parties


                                      52
<PAGE>

not in default or in breach. Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that the
