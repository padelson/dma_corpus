Agreement. From and after the Execution Date until the earlier of two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Agent shall

addition to any of the schedules delivered by the Seller Parties to the Buyer Parties on the
Execution Date (collectively, the &#147;<B><I>Seller Disclosure Schedules</I></B>&#148;) promptly after the Agent becomes
aware of the same by delivery of appropriate updates to the Seller Disclosure Schedules to the
Buyer Parties. To the extent such supplemental disclosures to the Seller Disclosure Schedules
relate to matters approved in writing by a Senior Vice President of Parent in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement (including <U>Section&nbsp;8.1</U> (the &#147;<B><I>Approved Disclosures</I></B>&#148;)), such
supplemental disclosures shall amend and supplement the Seller Disclosure Schedules delivered on
the Execution Date. If the matters disclosed in such supplemental disclosures to the Seller
Disclosure Schedules provided to the Buyer Parties have had or would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect, the Buyer Parties may terminate this Agreement pursuant to <U>Section
11.1(f)</U> or this <U>Section&nbsp;13.6</U> if the Buyer Parties so notify the Agent within 10
Business Days after receiving such supplemental disclosures, after which Buyer Parties shall be
deemed to have waived their rights to terminate this Agreement or prevent the consummation of the

the information contained in such supplemental disclosures. Except as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence, any such supplemental disclosures to the Seller Disclosure Schedules (other

indemnification provisions in <U>Article&nbsp;XII</U> and the representations and warranties contained
