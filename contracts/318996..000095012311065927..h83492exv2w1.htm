 (A) all shares of Parent Share Consideration other than the Escrow Shares described in  _Section 2.2(b)(i)(B)_ shall be issued directly to the Accredited Holders at Closing in the proportions set forth opposite each Accredited Holders name in a schedule to be delivered by the Agent to the Buyer Parties no later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Merger Consideration Schedule_ " ); and 

  

 (B) a number of shares of Parent Share Consideration (the " _Escrow Shares_ ") with an aggregate Market Price on the Execution Date that, together with the Escrow Cash Deposit, equals 7.5% of the Base Consideration (the " _Escrow Shares_ ") will be issued in the names of the Accredited Holders in the proportions set forth opposite each Accredited Holders name on the Merger Consideration Schedule and deposited with the Escrow Agent at Closing on behalf of such Accredited Holders, to be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Account in accordance with _Article IV_ and the terms of the Escrow Agreement;

 (B) an amount equal to 7.5% of the portion of the Cash Amount that would be payable to the Non-Accredited Holders pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)(iii)(A)_ in the absence of this  _Section 2.2(b)(iii)(B)_ (the " _Escrow Cash Deposit_ ") will be deposited with the Escrow Agent at Closing on behalf of the Non-Accredited Holders in the proportions set forth opposite each Non-Accredited Holders name on the Merger Consideration Schedule, to be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Account in accordance with _Article IV_ and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 2.3 _Payment of Debt Payoff Amount_. At the Closing, the Buyer Parties will pay, or cause to be paid, the Debt Payoff Amount, if any, on behalf of the Seller Parties to the applicable lenders in accordance with _Section 10.3(e)_.

 2.6 _Deliveries and Actions at Closing_.

 2.7 _Tax Treatment of Transactions_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable state or local Tax purposes that follow the U.S. federal income tax treatment), the Parties agree to treat the transactions contemplated by this Agreement consistent with Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 CB 432 (1/15/1999). The Parties agree to file all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing, and not to take any position inconsistent with this treatment, unless and until there has been a Final Determination to the contrary. The Parties also agree that the Acquired Companies obligations to pay the Debt Payoff Amount, the Transaction Costs and the Change of Control Payments shall have accrued as of the Closing Date, and the Holders and the Acquired Companies (as distinguished from the Buyer Parties and the Surviving Entities) shall be entitled to any deductions relating to such payment obligations for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for Texas franchise purposes and for purposes of any applicable state or local Taxes that follow the federal treatment). The Acquired Companies shall take into account such deductions on their respective Forms 1065 (U.S. Return of Partnership Income) and any applicable state or local income tax returns that follow the federal treatment for their taxable years ending on or before the Closing Date (it being understood that each of the Acquired Companies will terminate as a partnership under Section 708(b)(1)(A) of the Code as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and thus its final taxable year for such purposes will end on the Closing Date). 

       ##### 

  

     

 2.8 _Allocation of Merger Consideration_. The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to agree upon an allocation of the Merger Consideration, as finally determined pursuant to  _Section 2.2_, and such other consideration required to be taken into account, and as may be required to be adjusted to take into account the treatment of the Escrow Cash as the property of the Buyer Parties for U.S. federal income tax purposes, among the Acquired Assets in accordance with this _Section 2.8_ and Sections 755 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. On or prior to the date that is 90 days after the determination of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheets, the Final Net Working Capital and the Final CapEx Reimbursement Amount in accordance with _Section 3.2(b)_ and taking into account any adjustments to the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.2_, the Buyer Parties shall prepare a schedule allocating the Merger Consideration (subject to such adjustments and any further adjustments required to be taken into account to reflect the treatment of the Escrow Cash as the property of the Buyer Parties) and other amounts paid by the Buyer Parties to the Seller Parties among the Acquired Assets, including the covenant in _Section 8.5_, in accordance with this _Section 2.8_ and Sections 755 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the " _Asset Allocation_ "). Within 30 days after the receipt of the Asset Allocation, the Agent shall provide written notice to the Buyer Parties of any changes to the Asset Allocation or otherwise shall be deemed to have agreed with the Asset Allocation. If the Agent proposed changes to the Asset Allocation and the Agent and the Buyer Parties cannot agree upon a revised Asset Allocation within 30 days following the Agents written notice, then the Buyer Parties shall engage the Independent Accountant to resolve such dispute. The Independent Accountant shall review the disputed matters and as promptly as practicable deliver to the Buyer Parties and the Agent a statement setting forth its determination as to the proper treatment of the matters in dispute, and such determination shall constitute the final Asset Allocation and shall be final and binding upon the Parties without any further right of appeal. All charges of the Independent Accountant and other expenses directly incurred in making such determination shall be borne by the Party against whom the majority of items were determined (based on amounts in dispute). If, subsequent to the Closing, there occurs any increase or decrease in the consideration paid for the Acquired Interests within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1060-1(e)(1)(ii)(B), the Parties shall adjust the Asset Allocation in a manner consistent with this _Section 2.8_, including the dispute resolution process contained herein. The Parties shall not file any Tax Return or otherwise take, or permit any Affiliate to take, any position with respect to Taxes which is inconsistent with such Asset Allocation, except as required by Law following a Final Determination. 

   

ARTICLE III 
 MERGER CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENT 

   

 3.1 _Estimated Merger Consideration Adjustment Procedures_. 

    

 (a) The Parties acknowledge that the Merger Consideration has been based in part on the Acquired Companies having an aggregate minimum Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date equal to $20,614,048 (the " _Net Working Capital Threshold_ "). The Cash Amount delivered at the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.2_ shall be adjusted in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 3.1_. The Agent shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to the Buyer Parties, no later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (i) an estimated balance sheet of each of the Acquired Companies as of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Closing Date, each of which balance sheets will be prepared in accordance with
GAAP, applied consistently with the classifications, judgments, valuation
methodologies and estimation methodologies used historically by the
applicable Acquired Company, except that such balance sheets shall be
prepared using the non-GAAP classifications, judgments and methodologies
set forth on _Annex B_ (the " _Agreed NWC Accounting Principles_ ");
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that, even if inconsistent with GAAP as so applied
or the Agreed NWC Accounting Principles, such balance sheets shall not take
into account the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the balance
sheets prepared in accordance with the foregoing are referred to as the "
_Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheets_ ") and (ii) an estimate of the CapEx
Reimbursement Amount (the " _Estimated CapEx Reimbursement Amount_ "). The
Agent shall also prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered,
to the Buyer Parties a worksheet showing the Net Working Capital shown on the
Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheets (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_
"). 

   

 (b) If the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital Threshold (such excess, the " _Estimated Buyer Working Capital Payment_ "), the Merger Consideration delivered at the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.2_ shall be increased by an amount equal to the Estimate Buyer Working Capital Payment (as contemplated by _Section 2.2_). 

   

 (c) If the Net Working Capital Threshold exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital (such excess, the " _Estimated Holders Working Capital Payment_ "), the Merger Consideration delivered at the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.2_ shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Estimated Holders Working Capital Payment (as contemplated by _Section 2.2_). 

   

 (d) The Merger Consideration delivered at the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.2_ shall be increased by an amount equal to the Estimated CapEx Reimbursement Amount (as contemplated by  _Section 2.2_). 

  

 3.2 _Final Merger Consideration Adjustment Procedures_. 

    

 (a) For the purpose of confirming the Estimated Working Capital Payment or the Estimated Buyer Working Capital Payment, as applicable, and the Estimated CapEx Reimbursement Amount, the Buyer Parties shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, (i) a balance sheet of each of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date, each of which balance sheets will be prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied consistently with the classifications, judgments, valuation methodologies and estimation methodologies used to prepare the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheets, except that such balance sheets shall be prepared using the Agreed NWC Accounting Principles;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, even if inconsistent with GAAP as so applied or the Agreed NWC Accounting Principles, the balance sheets shall not take into account the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the balance sheets prepared in accordance with the foregoing are referred to as the " _Final Closing Date Balance Sheets_ ") and (ii) a schedule of the CapEx Reimbursement Amount (the " _Final CapEx Reimbursement Schedule_ "). 

   

 (b) No later than 60 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer Parties shall deliver to the Agent the Final Closing Date Balance Sheets and the Final CapEx 

   ##### 

  

    

Reimbursement Schedule together with a worksheet showing the difference, if
any, between (i) the Net Working Capital shown on the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheets (the " _Final Net Working Capital_ ") and the Estimated Net
Working Capital and (ii) the CapEx Reimbursement Amount shown on the Final
CapEx Reimbursement Schedule (the " _Final CapEx Reimbursement Amount_ ") and
the Estimated CapEx Reimbursement Amount. If within 30 days after the date of
the delivery to the Agent of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheets and the
Final CapEx Reimbursement Schedule the Agent determines in good faith that
the Agent disagrees with any portion of the Final Closing Date Balance
Sheets or the Final CapEx Reimbursement Schedule and the amount of such
disagreement exceeds $25,000 (any such disputed items being the " _Disputed
Items_ "), then the Agent may deliver a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_
") to the Buyer Parties within such 30-day period, which Dispute Notice
shall: (i) set forth the Agents proposed resolution of the Disputed Items
(including the Agents determination of Net Working Capital or the CapEx
Reimbursement Amount (as applicable) taking into account such proposed
resolution of the Disputed Items) and (ii) include materials showing in
reasonable detail the Agents support for such position. Any matters impacting
the calculation of Final Net Working Capital or the Final CapEx Reimbursement
Amount that are not included as Disputed Items in a timely delivered Dispute
Notice and that are not affected by the resolution of Disputed Items shall be
deemed accepted by the Agent and shall be binding and final for all purposes
of this Agreement, and (A) the failure by the Agent to provide a Dispute
Notice within such 30-day period or (B) the delivery by the Agent to the
Buyer Parties during such 30-day period of a written notice stating that the
Agent has elected not to deliver a Dispute Notice, will constitute a full and
complete acceptance of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheets and the Final
CapEx Reimbursement Schedule as determined by the Buyer Parties and such
Final Closing Date Balance Sheets and such Final CapEx Reimbursement Schedule
shall be binding and final for all purposes of this Agreement. Until the
final determination of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheets, the Final Net
Working Capital, the Final CapEx Reimbursement Schedule and the Final CapEx
Reimbursement Amount in accordance with this _Section 3.2(b)_, the Agent and
its representatives shall have full access to the Books and Records, the
personnel of, and work papers prepared by, the Buyer Parties and/or the Buyer
Parties representatives to the extent that they relate to such matters and
to such historical financial information (to the extent in Buyer Parties
possession) relating to such matters as Agent may reasonably request for the
purpose of reviewing the Final Closing Date Balance Sheets and the Final CapEx
Reimbursement Schedule and the determination of the Final Net Working Capital
and the Final CapEx Reimbursement Amount and to prepare a Dispute Notice;
_provided_ _that_ such access shall be in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the normal business operations of the Buyer Parties or the
Acquired Companies. If the Buyer Parties and the Agent are unable to resolve
any disagreement among them with respect to such matters within 15 days (or
such longer period as mutually agreed to by the Agent and the Buyer Parties)
after the delivery of a Dispute Notice by the Agent to the Buyer Parties,
then the Disputed Items (but no others) may be referred by the Agent or the
Buyer Parties for determination to Ernst and Young LLP (or, if they are unable
or unwilling to serve, another nationally recognized accounting firm not
affiliated with the Seller Parties or the Buyer Parties that is mutually
selected by the Agent and the Buyer Parties). If the Agent and the Buyer
Parties are unable to select a nationally recognized accounting firm within
five Business Days of Ernst and Young LLP declining to accept such engagement,
either the Agent or the Buyer Parties may 

   ##### 

  

    

thereafter request that the American Arbitration Association make such
selection (as applicable, Ernst and Young LLP, the firm selected by the Agent
and the Buyer Parties or the firm selected by the American Arbitration
Association is referred to as the " _Independent Accountant_ "). Each of the
Agent and the Buyer Parties (acting collectively) shall provide the
Independent Accountant and the other party with a statement of its position
as to the amount for each Disputed Item within 15 days from the date of the
referral. The Independent Accountant shall make a written determination as
promptly as practicable, but in any event within 30 days after the date on
which the dispute is referred to the Independent Accountant, by selecting from
the position of either the Agent (on one hand) or the Buyer Parties (on the
other hand) as to the amount of the Disputed Items. The Independent
Accountant shall be authorized to select only the position as to the amount
of Final Net Working Capital or the Final CapEx Reimbursement Amount (as
applicable) as presented by either the Agent (on the one hand) or the Buyer
Parties (on the other hand). The Independent Accountant shall have no power
to reach any other result and shall select the Final Net Working Capital or
the Final CapEx Reimbursement Amount (as applicable) that, in its judgment,
is the closest to being in conformity with this Agreement. If at any time the
Agent and the Buyer Parties resolve their dispute, then notwithstanding the
preceding provisions of this _Section 3.2(b)_, the Independent Accountants
involvement promptly shall be discontinued and the Final Closing Date Balance
Sheets or the Final CapEx Reimbursement Schedule (as applicable) shall be
revised, if necessary, to reflect such resolution and thereupon shall be
final and binding for all purposes of this Agreement. The Parties shall make
readily available to the Independent Accountant all relevant Books and
Records relating to such matters and all other items reasonably requested by
the Independent Accountant in connection with resolving the Disputed Items.
The costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne by the
Parties whose position as to the amount of the Disputed Items was not selected
by the Independent Accountant. The decision of the Independent Accountant
shall be final and binding for all purposes of this Agreement and the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheets or the Final CapEx Reimbursement Schedule (as
applicable) shall be revised, if necessary, to reflect such decision and
thereupon shall be final and binding for all purposes of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Following the final determination of the Final Net Working Capital and the Final CapEx Reimbursement Amount in accordance with _Section 3.2(b)_, the Buyer Parties or the Agent (on behalf of the Holders), as applicable, shall make or cause to be made such true-up payments to one another as are required to place the Buyer Parties and the Holders in the same position in which they would have been had the Final Closing Date Balance Sheets, the Final Net Working Capital, the Final CapEx Reimbursement Schedule and the Final CapEx Reimbursement Amount been known at the Closing and had the Final Net Working Capital and the Final CapEx Reimbursement Amount, rather than the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Estimated CapEx Reimbursement Amount, been used to determine the Merger Consideration at the Closing. 

   

 (d) Any true-up payment required to be made by the Agent pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_ is referred to as the " _Final Holders Payment_." If the Agent is required to make the Final Holders Payment, then (i) the Agent (on behalf of the Holders) shall promptly (but in any event within five Business Days) pay an amount equal to the Final Holders Payment to an account designated by the Buyer Parties in accordance with _Section 13.2_ by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Reimbursement Fund Amount and (ii) to the extent the 

   ##### 

  

    

Final Holders Payment exceeds the then remaining balance of the Reimbursement
Fund Amount, the Agent shall notify the Buyer Parties thereof and the Agent
and the Buyer Parties shall promptly (but in any event within five Business
Days) issue Joint Instruction Letters to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account Escrow Funds in an aggregate
amount equal to the remaining portion of the Final Holders Payment to the
Buyer Parties (with respect to any Escrow Shares so released) or to an
account designated by the Buyer Parties in accordance with _Section 13.2_ by
wire transfer of immediately available funds (with respect to any Escrow Cash
so released) within three Business Days of receipt of such Joint Instruction
Letters and otherwise in accordance with _Section 4.2(b)_ and _4.2(c)_
 below. 

   

 (e) Any true-up payment required to be made by the Buyer Parties pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_ is referred to as the " _Final Buyer Payment_." If the Buyer Parties are required to make the Final Buyer Payment, then the Buyer Parties shall promptly (but in any event within five Business Days) pay or cause to be paid an amount equal to the Final Buyer Payment to the Holders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the wire transfer instructions set forth on the Merger Consideration Schedule. 

  

 3.3 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. All amounts to be paid under this _Article III_ shall be deemed to be adjustments to the Merger Consideration, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. 

   

ARTICLE IV 
 ESCROW 

   

 4.1 _Escrow Deposit_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, as provided in _Section 2.2_, the Buyer Parties shall deposit the Escrow Shares and the Escrow Cash Deposit with the Escrow Agent to be to be held, invested, safeguarded and released by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement. The Parties agree that all Escrow Shares shall be treated as the property of the Accredited Holder in whose name such Escrow Shares were issued at the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)(i)(B)_ and _Section 2.2(b)(iv)_ (as applicable) for all federal and state income tax purposes unless and until disbursed in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Parties agree that all Escrow Cash shall be treated in accordance with Section 3.11 of the Escrow Agreement for all federal and state income tax purposes. 

   

 4.2 _Releases_. 

    

 (a) The Escrow Agreement will provide that releases of any of the Escrow Funds shall be made only in accordance with written instructions that are jointly signed by the Agent and the Buyer Parties, which instructions shall be in a form that complies with the requirements of the Escrow Agreement (a " _Joint Instruction Letter_ ") or pursuant to an award, judgment, decision or order rendered pursuant to _Section 13.4_ and/or the Escrow Agreement specifying the number of Escrow Shares or the amount of Escrow Cash to be released from the Escrow Account and the Person or Persons to whom such Escrow Shares or Escrow Cash shall be released. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) In the event that an Accredited Holder or Accredited Holders become obligated finally to (i) the Buyer Parties under _Section 3.2(d)_ in respect of any portion of a Final Holders Payment or (ii) any Buyer Indemnified Party under the terms of _Article XII_ in respect of any indemnification obligation and, subject to the limitations on the Accredited Holders liability under _Article XII_ and elsewhere in this Agreement, at such time that there are any remaining Escrow Shares in the Escrow Account, then the Agent and Buyer Parties shall execute and deliver a Joint Instruction Letter to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release to the Buyer Parties or such Buyer Indemnified Party, as applicable, a number of Escrow Shares (to the extent Escrow Shares then remain in the Escrow Account that are sufficient to satisfy such obligation) determined by dividing (1) the amount required to satisfy such obligation by (2) the Market Price as of the date such Buyer Indemnified Party was finally determined to be entitled to indemnification with respect to the relevant Claim(s). Subject to _Section 12.6_ , any such release of Escrow Shares from the Escrow Account shall be allocated against the Accredited Holders in proportion to each Accredited Holders Accredited Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Shares, except for any such release in respect of any indemnification obligation that relates to the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant made by any particular Accredited Holder in this Agreement, in which case such release shall be allocated solely against such Accredited Holders Accredited Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Shares. 

   

 (c) In the event that a Non-Accredited Holder or Non-Accredited Holders become obligated finally to (i) the Buyer Parties under _Section 3.2(d)_ in respect of any portion of a Final Holders Payment or (ii) any Buyer Indemnified Party under the terms of _Article XII_ in respect of any indemnification obligation and, subject to the limitations on the Non-Accredited Holders liability under _Article XII_ and elsewhere in this Agreement, at such time that there is any remaining Escrow Cash in the Escrow Account, then the Agent and Buyer Parties shall execute and deliver a Joint Instruction Letter to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release (to the extent Escrow Cash then remains in the Escrow Account that is sufficient to satisfy such obligation) the cash amount required to satisfy such obligation. Subject to _Section 12.6_, any such release of Escrow Cash from the Escrow Account shall be allocated against the Non-Accredited Holders in proportion to each Non-Accredited Holders Non-Accredited Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Cash, except for any such release in respect of any indemnification obligation that relates to the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant made by any particular Non-Accredited Holder in this Agreement, in which case such release shall be allocated solely against such Non-Accredited Holders Non-Accredited Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Cash. 

   

 (d) On the date that is 15 months after the Closing Date, the Agent and the Buyer Parties shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Instruction Letter instructing the Escrow Agent to release to the Holders all of the Escrow Funds then held in the Escrow Account (except for any Escrow Funds then in the Escrow Account which the Escrow Agent has been validly instructed to release to any Buyer Indemnified Party in accordance with the Escrow Agreement but has not actually released as of such date) less (i) a number of Escrow Shares (valued at the Market Price of such Escrow Shares as of the date that is 15 months after the Closing Date) and (ii) an amount of Escrow Cash, with an aggregate value equal to the amount set forth in any and all Claim Notices submitted in good faith by any Buyer Indemnified Party prior to such date in accordance with _Article XII_ (so long as the facts 

   ##### 

  

    

or circumstances alleged to give rise to the claim for indemnification
underlying such Claim Notice have been specified in reasonable detail) that
remain pending as of such date. Escrow Funds so released shall be distributed
to the Holders in accordance with _Section 4.2(f)_. 

   

 (e) Following resolution from time to time of any Claim underlying any Claim Notice for which a reserve of a portion of the Escrow Funds was established pursuant to _Section 4.2(d)_ , the Agent and the Buyer Parties shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Instruction Letter instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account to a Buyer Indemnified Party: (i) a number of Escrow Shares (valued at the Market Price of such Escrow Shares as of the date of the final resolution of such Claim) plus (ii) an amount of Escrow Cash, with an aggregate value equal to such portion of the reserve amount as is appropriate for the resolution of such Claim. During the pendency of a Claim for which such a reserve was established, the Agent and the Buyer Parties shall evaluate the amount of such reserve from time to time as the circumstances of such Claim warrant, and, to the extent the Agent and the Buyer Parties agree (each acting reasonably in relation thereto) that such reserve is then greater than the amount that is reasonably expected to be paid in respect of such Claim, Escrow Funds in an amount equal to such excess shall be released to the Holders and distributed in accordance with  _Section 4.2(f)_. Following resolution of all such Claims for which such a reserve was established and the release of Escrow Funds to a Buyer Indemnified Party, if any, pursuant to the two preceding sentences, any Escrow Funds remaining in the Escrow Account that were reserved pending resolution of such Claims (except for any Escrow Funds then in the Escrow Account which the Escrow Agent has been validly instructed to release to any Buyer Indemnified Party in accordance with the Escrow Agreement but has not actually released as of such date) shall be released to the Holders and distributed in accordance with _Section 4.2(f)_. 

   

 (f) Escrow Funds released to the Holders pursuant to _Section 4.2(d)_ or _Section 4.2(e)_ shall be distributed as follows: 

  

 (i) any Escrow Shares to be released to the Holders shall be released solely to the Accredited Holders in proportion to each Accredited Holders Accredited Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Shares and shall give effect to any previous releases of Escrow Shares pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_ that were allocated to any particular Accredited Holder as contemplated in _Section 4.2(b)_; and 

  

 (ii) any Escrow Cash to be released to the Holders shall be released solely to the Non-Accredited Holders in proportion to each Non-Accredited Holders Non-Accredited Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Cash and shall give effect to any previous releases of Escrow Cash pursuant to  _Section 4.2(c)_ that were allocated to any particular Non-Accredited Holder as contemplated in _Section 4.2(c)_. 

   

 (g) If Parent distributes a dividend (whether of cash or shares of Parent Common Stock or other Interests) in respect of any Escrow Share during the period when such Escrow Share is held in the Escrow Account that would otherwise be distributable to the Accredited Holder in whose name such Escrow Share has been issued and for whose account such Escrow Share is being held in the Escrow Account, then Parent shall issue such shares of Parent Common Stock or other Interests to such Accredited Holder in accordance with the 

   ##### 

  

    

terms of this _Section 4.2(g)_ and shall deliver such cash, shares of Parent
Common Stock or other Interests to the Escrow Agent to be deposited in the
Escrow Account to be held for the account of such Accredited Holder. Such
cash, shares of Parent Common Stock or other Interests shall be treated in
all respects as Escrow Funds hereunder. 

   

 (h) The applicable Accredited Holders in whose name any Escrow Shares have been issued shall have the exclusive right to exercise all voting rights pertaining to such Escrow Shares held in the Escrow Account for the account of such Accredited Holder unless and until such Escrow Shares are distributed from the Escrow Account to a Person other than such Accredited Holder. 

   

 (i) In the event of a conflict between the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. In the event that any Party receives a release of any Escrow Funds pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to which it is not entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, such Party shall (i) if another party is entitled to such Escrow Funds at that time, transfer such Escrow Funds to such other party, or (ii) if no other party is entitled to such Escrow Funds at that time, deposit such Escrow Funds with the Escrow Agent to be held and released pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 (j) If either the Agent or any Buyer Party shall fail to timely execute and deliver a Joint Instruction Letter when required under this Agreement, the Agent or the Buyer Parties, as applicable, shall be entitled to seek an order, judgment or decision (in accordance with  _Section 13.4_) that will enable the Escrow Agent to release to the applicable Person or Persons the Escrow Shares to which they are entitled under this Agreement and to seek to recover Losses from the Agent or the Buyer Parties, as applicable, as a result of such failure to comply with this Agreement. 

   

 (k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article IV_, if any share certificate representing Escrow Shares is deposited with the Escrow Agent on behalf of any Accredited Holder and such share certificate represents more than the number of Escrow Shares that are to be released and disbursed to any Person in accordance with this _Article IV_ and the Escrow Agreement, then the Buyer Parties and the Agent shall cooperate to: (i) instruct the Escrow Agent to release such share certificate from the Escrow Account; (ii) cancel such share certificate; and (iii) replace such share certificate with (A) a share certificate representing the number of Escrow Shares to be released and disbursed to such Person, which shall be issued in the name of and delivered to such Person (or as may be otherwise directed by such Person and, if such Person is Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent, such Escrow Shares shall be cancelled rather than represented on such replacement share certificate), and (B) a share certificate representing all remaining Escrow Shares that were then or deposit in the Escrow Account on behalf of such Accredited Holder immediately prior to such release and disbursement, which shall be issued in the name of the applicable Accredited Holder on whose behalf such Escrow Shares were deposited in the Escrow Account and shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent to hold in the Escrow Account in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 4.3 _No Fractional Shares_. If any calculation of a number of Escrow Shares under this  _Article IV_ does not yield a whole number of Escrow Shares, then the number of Escrow 

      ##### 

  

    

Shares shall be rounded, up or down, to the nearest whole number of Escrow
Shares (with any 1/2 share being rounded up) for all purposes of this
_Article IV_.

The Parent Share Consideration, when issued, sold and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement for the consideration contemplated by this Agreement, will be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and will be free of all mortgages, pledges, security interests, or other Liens of any nature and restrictions imposed by or through Parent and will not have been issued or sold in violation of the preemptive rights of any Person or applicable securities Laws.

Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act (each such document, excluding any exhibits
thereto, a " _Parent SEC Filing_ "). Except as set forth on _Schedule 7.6_,
each Parent SEC Filing, at the time such report was filed with or furnished
to the Commission complied in all material respects with the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act. No Parent SEC Filing, at the time such report was filed
with or furnished to the Commission, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein in order to make the statements contained therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial
statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Filings complied as to form
in all material respects with published rules and regulations of the
Commission with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited
financial statements, as permitted under Form 10-Q or Form 8-K under the
Exchange Act) and fairly presented in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries
as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of Parents
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year end audit
adjustments). Parent is not an ineligible issuer as defined in Rule 405 under
the Securities Act. 

   

 7.7 _No Material Adverse Change_. 

    

 (a) Since December 31, 2010, except as set forth in or contemplated by the Parent SEC Filings filed since December 31, 2010 and on or prior to the Execution Date, there has not been any event, occurrence or development which has had, or which would reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) Parent (i) has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluations of internal control over financial reporting by its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer, to Parents outside auditors and the audit committee of Parents Board of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses (as such terms are defined in the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boards Auditing Standard No. 2 or No. 5, as applicable) in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees of Parent who have a significant role in Parents internal control over financial reporting. To the Knowledge of Parent, there is no reason that Parents outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, without qualification, when next due. 

  

 7.8 _Financial Ability_.

the Closing Date, the sale, rental or other provision of goods, services or a
combination of goods and services that are the same as or similar to those

 (D) no Subject Holder shall, directly or indirectly cause, solicit, induce or encourage any Continuing Employee to leave such employment. (for purposes of clarification, any such Employee whose employment with either Acquired Company (or either of the Surviving Entities) terminates without violation of this _Section 8.5_ may be solicited and hired by any such Subject Holder without restriction under this _Section 8.5_); 

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that (y) the restrictions contained in this
_Section 8.5(a)_ shall not restrict any Subject Holders activities on behalf
of the Parent or any of its Affiliates and (z) the restrictions contained in
paragraphs (A) and (B) of this _Section 8.5(a)_ shall not restrict the
acquisition by any Subject Holder of (1) any Interests in Parent or (2) less
than 2% of the outstanding capital stock of any other publicly traded company
engaged in a Restricted Business. 

    

 (b) The Subject Holders hereby acknowledge and agree that, during the course of their association with the Acquired Companies, they have gained certain confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets of the Acquired Companies and the Business (" _Acquired Company Confidential Information_ "), including information with respect to customers and potential customers, new lines of business and areas of operation, suppliers, pricing, bids, projects, pricing methods, operations, processes, protocols, products, inventions, business practices, finances, compensation paid to employees or other terms of employment, the use or disclosure of which by any Subject Holder would be detrimental to Acquired Companies and the Buyer Parties. Accordingly, for so long as the restrictions set forth in _Section 8.5(a)_ are in place, each Subject Holder shall (i) maintain in confidence and not directly or indirectly use, disseminate, disclose or publish, or use for his benefit or the benefit of any Person other than the Parent and its Affiliates Acquired Company Confidential Information, and (ii) not possess other than in its capacity as an officer or employee of the Parent or its Affiliates or deliver to any Person any document, record, notebook, laptop computer, computer program or similar repository of or containing any such Acquired Company Confidential Information.

 (c) If any Subject Holder breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the provisions of this _Section 8.5_, then, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including anything contained in _Section 12.3_ or _Section 12.5_, the Buyer Parties or Acquired Companies shall have the right and remedy to have the provisions of this _Section 8.5_ specifically enforced by any court having jurisdiction, and the Subject Holders hereby consent 

   ##### 

  

    

that temporary or permanent injunctive relief shall be granted in the event of
breach of such provisions, all without the need to post a bond or any other
security or to prove actual damage or that money damages would not provide an
adequate remedy, and the Subject Holders expressly acknowledge and agree that
(i) any such breach or threatened breach would cause immediate and
irreparable injury to Buyer Parties and the Acquired Companies for which
monetary damages would not provide an adequate remedy, (ii) such Subject
Holder will not assert, and hereby does waive forever, the claim or defense
that there is an adequate remedy at law for purposes of the Buyer Parties or
the Acquired Companies obtaining injunctive relief and (iii) Buyer Parties
and the Acquired Companies will suffer irreparable damage if any Subject
Holder violates any of the covenants set forth in this _Section 8.5_. Such
injunctive relief shall be in addition to all other remedies available to the
Buyer Parties at law and in equity. Additionally, in the event that any
Subject Holder violates any covenant set forth in this  _Section 8.5_, then
any time period applicable to such violated covenant shall be tolled for the
duration of such breach. 

   

 (d) Insofar as the covenants set forth in this _Section 8.5_ are concerned, the Subject Holders specifically acknowledge and agree as follows: (i) they are the principal equity owners of the Acquired Companies and are receiving a substantial monetary benefit as a result of the sale of the Acquired Companies to Buyer Parties; (ii) the business of the Acquired Companies is highly competitive and the assets of the Acquired Companies, including goodwill, customer and prospective customer contacts, potential revenue and customer lists and Acquired Company Confidential Information, are valuable, special and unique as used by the Acquired Companies in the Business and that protection against competition is of critical importance to Buyer Parties; (iii) the covenants contained in this _Section 8.5_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the Acquired Company Confidential Information and goodwill and the operation and business of the Acquired Companies; (iv) the time duration of the covenants and the geographical area limitations of the covenants contained in this _Section 8.5_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the Acquired Company Confidential Information and goodwill and the operation and business of the Acquired Companies; and (v) such covenants are not oppressive to the Subject Holders and do not impose a greater restraint on the Subject Holders than is necessary to protect the Acquired Company Confidential Information and goodwill and the operation and business of the Acquired Companies. 

   

 (e) It is the express intention of Buyer Parties, the Acquired Companies and Subject Holders to comply with all Laws which may be applicable to the covenants in this _Section 8.5_. Consequently, if any court shall determine any covenant contained in this _Section 8.5_ to be effective in any particular area or jurisdiction only if such covenant is modified to limit its duration or scope, such covenant shall be reformed or modified by the judgment or order of such court to reflect a lawful and enforceable duration or scope. Such covenant automatically shall be deemed to be amended and modified with respect to that particular area or jurisdiction so as to comply with the judgment or order of such court and, as to all other areas and jurisdictions covered by this Agreement, the terms and provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect as originally written. If any court shall hold any covenants contained in this  _Section 8.5_ to be void or otherwise unenforceable in any particular area or jurisdiction notwithstanding the operation of this provision, such covenant automatically shall be deemed to be amended so as to eliminate therefrom that particular area 

   ##### 

  

    

or jurisdiction as to which such covenant is so held void or otherwise
unenforceable and, as to all other areas and jurisdictions covered by this
Agreement, the terms and provisions hereof shall remain in full force and
effect as originally written. 

  

 8.6 _Use of Name_. From and after the Closing Date, none of the Holders nor any of their Affiliates will directly or indirectly use in any manner any trade name, trademark, service mark or logo used by the Acquired Companies (other than in the performance of any such Holders duties as an employee or otherwise on behalf of the Surviving Entities, the Buyer Parties or any of their respective Affiliates). The Holders shall cause each of Edge Holding and Edge Frac Pumping Services, L.L.C. to change its name so as not to include the word "Edge." 

   

 8.7 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Cooperation_. 

    

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and to ensure the satisfaction of its conditions to Closing set forth in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: 

  

 (i) obtain all necessary waivers, consents, releases and approvals from other Persons to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 (ii) obtain all consents, approvals and authorizations that are required to be obtained under any Law; 

  

 (iii) lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 (iv) effect all necessary registrations and filings, including submissions of information requested by Governmental Authorities; and

At the Closing, Seller Parties shall cause to be delivered to Buyer Parties evidence of such additional insured status to the extent obtained.

The Buyer Parties shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all other Tax Returns required to be filed by or for the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date with respect to any Tax period that ends before or includes the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ "). Unless otherwise required by Law, the Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Acquired Companies.

 (b) The Buyer Parties shall not take any action, or allow the Surviving Entities or any of their Affiliates to take any action, in each case other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, that would increase the liability of the Holders or the Acquired Companies for Taxes attributable to a Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date. The Buyer Parties shall pay to the Agent, no later than five Business Days prior to the due date for payment of Taxes due from the Acquired Companies, an amount equal to the excess of (i) the amount accrued as a liability for such Taxes in Net Working Capital shown on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheets over (ii) the amount of such Taxes actually determined or reported to be due as of such date (with the amount of Taxes due with respect to a Straddle Period apportioned between the Holders and the Buyer Parties in accordance with the attribution of liability for Taxes provided in the definition of Seller Taxes) for distribution by the Agent to the Edge Holders with responsibility for the payment of such Taxes, in proportion to their Pro Rata Shares, on or prior to such due date. The Buyer Parties shall promptly pay to the Agent for distribution to the Holders who bore responsibility for such Taxes being refunded, in proportion to their Pro Rata Shares the amount of any refunds received by the Buyer Parties, the Surviving Entities or their respective Subsidiaries, after deducting any costs or Taxes incurred in connection with obtaining and receiving the refund, to the extent such refunds (x) are attributable to a Tax period of either Acquired Company ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or are attributable to the portion of a Straddle Period of an Acquired Company that ends on the Closing Date and (y) exceed the amount accrued therefor as an asset in Net Working Capital shown on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheets (with the amount of Taxes due with respect to a Straddle Period apportioned between the Holders and the Buyer Parties in accordance with the attribution of liability for Taxes provided in the definition of Seller Taxes). 

   

 (c) The Agent and the Buyer Parties shall, and the Buyer Parties shall cause the Surviving Entities and their Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and representatives to reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns relating to any Tax period beginning on or before the Closing Date, including maintaining and making available to each other, and to any Tax Authority as reasonably

Tax Returns and payment of Taxes of the Acquired Companies and in resolving
all disputes and audits with respect to any Tax period beginning on or before

 (d) The Buyer Parties hereby agree, from and after the Closing, to pay all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, recording, value added, registration and other similar Taxes and all conveyance fees, recording fees and other similar charges (all including penalties, interest and other charges with respect thereto, collectively " _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Holders from and against all Transfer Taxes so incurred; provided, however, that the applicable Holders specified on _Schedule 8.15_ shall pay all Transfer Taxes incurred with respect to the assets and liabilities being retained by such Holder pursuant to _Section 8.15_. 

   

 (e) If a Claim with respect to Taxes shall be made by any Governmental Authority, which, if successful, could result in an obligation to make an indemnity payment to a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to _Article XII_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "), then notwithstanding any provisions of  _Article XII_ to the contrary, the Buyer Parties shall promptly and in any event no more than 15 days following any Buyer Partys receipt of written notice of such Claim, give written notice to the Agent of such Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , the failure of the Buyer Parties to give such notice shall only relieve the Holders from their indemnification obligations hereunder to the extent they are actually prejudiced by such failure. Within 30 days of receipt of written notice of a Tax Claim, the Agent shall provide written notice to the Buyer Parties of its intent to control the defense of such Tax Claim. Upon providing such notice, the Agent shall be entitled to control all proceedings relating to such Tax Claim and may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) at its own expense;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer Parties shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such Tax Claim and shall jointly control the defense of any such Tax Claim the resolution of which would increase the Taxes of the Surviving Entities or their Subsidiaries for any period following the Closing Date. With respect to any Tax Claim that the Agent and the Buyer Parties jointly control, the parties agree not to settle, compromise or otherwise resolve the Tax Claim without the written consent of the Agent and the Buyer Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Absent written notice of the Agents intent to control the defense of a Tax Claim as set forth above, or upon written notification to the Buyer Parties that the Agent will decline to control the defense of a Tax Claim, the Buyer Parties shall thereupon be permitted to defend and settle such proceeding. The Agent, the Buyer Parties, the Surviving Entities and their Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate with each other in contesting or defending against any Tax Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and, upon the request of the party or parties controlling proceedings relating to such Tax Claim, the provision to such party or parties of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

Following such six year period, the Buyer Parties may retain or destroy such Books and Records in accordance with their record retention policies in effect from time to time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any Books and Records that are to be destroyed pursuant to such policies, the Buyer Parties will deliver such Books and Records to the Agent if requested by the Agent a reasonable time prior to such destruction.

 (e) _Mitigation_. The Parties agree that no Indemnified Party shall have any recourse under this _Article XII_ for any Losses that such Indemnified Party would not have suffered had such Indemnified Party exercised reasonable commercial efforts to mitigate such Losses within a reasonable amount of time following the discovery by such Indemnified Party of the fact, event or circumstance giving rise to such Losses (and for a Buyer Indemnified Party that is not a natural Person, the bringing to the attention of a responsible officer thereof of such fact, event or circumstance). 

   ##### 

  

   

 (f) _Disregard of Materiality Qualifications_. For purposes of determining whether any Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification for any Losses under this _Article XII_ arising from any breach of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 6.6(b)_ and  _Section 7.7(a)_) and in calculating the amount of such Losses, the Parties shall disregard (i) any requirement in any such representation or warranty that an event or fact be material, have a Material Adverse Effect, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or otherwise be subject to a similar qualification as to materiality, material adverse effect or words of similar import and (ii) any other references to materiality, material adverse effect or words of similar import in any such representation or warranty. 

   

 (g) _Recovery_. In the event that any Losses are suffered by any one or more Indemnified Parties for which any such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this _Article XII_ and any such Indemnified Party is indemnified by an Indemnifying Party with respect to such Losses, then such Losses shall be deemed to have been fully satisfied and shall no longer exist and, therefore, any further recovery by such Indemnified Party or any other Indemnified Party from any Indemnifying Party for such same Losses would constitute an unintended "double" recovery and shall be prohibited under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to seek recovery under such provisions of this _Article XII_ that maximize its recovery (e.g., if particular Losses would be subject to the Aggregate Cap if a claim were made under one provision but would not be subject to the Aggregate Cap if made under another provision, then the Indemnified Party may seek recovery under the provision that is not subject to the Aggregate Cap). 

   

 (h) _Knowledge_. The Indemnified Parties rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not be diminished by any investigation performed or knowledge acquired or capable of being acquired, whether before or after the Execution Date, regarding the accuracy or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty or the performance or non-performance of any covenant. 

  

 12.4 _Calculation of Losses_. 

    

 (a) The amount of any Losses for which any Indemnified Party is finally determined to be entitled to indemnification under this _Article XII_ shall be reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds actually received by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or Holder Indemnified Parties (as applicable) with respect to such Losses (net of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance proceeds and the amount of any retrospective or other current increase in premium that is directly attributable to the payment of such insurance proceeds), and (ii) indemnification or reimbursement payments actually received by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or Holder Indemnified Parties (as applicable) from third parties with respect to such Losses (net of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such payments). 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if any matter giving rise to a claim of Losses by any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article XII_ is reasonably likely to be covered by any insurance policy of any Party or its Affiliates, then the Parties shall cooperate with one another and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain 

   ##### 

  

    

reimbursement for such Losses under such insurance policy; _provided_ _,_  
_however_ _,_ that if any insurance proceeds are thereafter received with
respect to Losses that have been satisfied: 

  

 (i) by a release of any of the Escrow Shares, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly (A) until such time as the Escrow Account has been terminated in accordance with _Article IV_ and the Escrow Agreement, deliver to the Escrow Agent to be deposited in the Escrow Account cash in an amount equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds, net of reasonable out-of-pockets expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance proceeds, and such cash shall be treated in all respects thereafter for purposes of this Agreement as if same were Escrow Shares deposited for the credit of the applicable Accredited Holders and (B) from and after the termination of the Escrow Account in accordance with _Article IV_ and the Escrow Agreement, deliver to the Agent (for distribution to the Accredited Holders) cash in an amount equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds, net of such expenses; 

  

 (ii) by a release of any of the Escrow Cash, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly (A) until such time as the Escrow Account has been terminated in accordance with _Article IV_ and the Escrow Agreement, deliver to the Escrow Agent to be deposited in the Escrow Account cash in an amount equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds, net of reasonable out-of-pockets expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance proceeds, and such cash shall be treated in all respects as Escrow Cash thereafter and (B) from and after the termination of the Escrow Account in accordance with _Article IV_ and the Escrow Agreement, deliver to the Agent (for distribution to the Non-Accredited Holders) cash in an amount equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds, net of such expenses; and 

  

 (iii) otherwise directly by a Holder by a payment made by such Holder, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse each Holder for the amount of any such payment made directly by such Holder (up to the amount of the insurance proceeds received by such Indemnified Party, net of reasonable out-of-pockets expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance proceeds); 

 

 _provided_ _further_ that the amount of cash to be deposited or paid pursuant
to this  _Section 12.4(b)_ shall not exceed the amount of insurance proceeds
received, net of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such
proceeds, and shall be deposited or paid pursuant to clauses (i) through
(iii) in the same relative proportions such amount was disbursed or paid to
the Buyer Indemnified Parties in satisfaction of such Losses pursuant to 
_Section 12.6_. 

    

 (c) If no such insurance proceeds are received by a Buyer Indemnified Party after making the commercially reasonable efforts contemplated by _Section 12.4(b)_, and such Buyer Indemnified Party recovers any such Losses from an Indemnifying Party or Parties, then such Buyer Indemnified Party shall concurrently therewith execute and deliver to the Indemnifying Party or Parties such agreements, documents and instruments as may be reasonably necessary to assign to such Indemnifying Party or Parties its claim under such insurance policy with respect to such Losses and shall reasonably cooperate with such Indemnifying Party or Parties in its efforts to collect insurance proceeds thereunder.

 12.6 _Payment of Indemnification Claims_. To the extent it is finally determined that a Holder is required to provide an indemnification payment pursuant to _Section 12.7_ or  _Section 12.8_, the sole and exclusive method of satisfaction of such payment shall be, and recourse to recover for such indemnification payment shall be limited to the following: 

    

 (a) if such Holder is an Accredited Holder, first the release of a portion of Escrow Shares then deposited in the Escrow Account (up to such Accredited Holders Accredited Pro Rata Share of the aggregate number of Escrow Shares deposited in the Escrow Account on the Closing Date);  _provided_ _that_ , in no event shall the number of Escrow Shares released from the Escrow Account in respect of indemnification payments so required from such Accredited Holder exceed such Accredited Holders Accredited Pro Rata Share of such Escrow Shares; and then, to the extent any amounts remain owing, such amounts shall be payable directly by such Accredited Holder;  _provided_ _further_ _that_ , notwithstanding anything in _Section 12.3(b)(i)(B)_ to the contrary, if such Accredited Holder is a Brewer Holder, any amounts that remain owing in excess of such Accredited Holders Accredited Pro Rata Share of such Escrow Shares shall additionally be payable from Brewers Accredited Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Shares, and, to the extent no Escrow Shares are then held for the account of such Accredited Holder or Brewer either because all such shares have been released or because the Escrow Account has been terminated, then any amounts that remain owing by such Accredited 

   ##### 

  

    

Holder shall additionally be payable directly by Brewer on behalf of such
Accredited Holder, and, in any such case, such Accredited Holder shall
thereafter reimburse and indemnify Brewer for any such amounts as are paid by
Brewer on such Accredited Holders behalf and for any Losses incurred by
Brewer in connection therewith; and 

   

 (b) If such Holder is a Non-Accredited Holder, first the release of Escrow Cash then deposited in the Escrow Account (up to such Non-Accredited Holders Non-Accredited Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Cash deposited in the Escrow Account on the Closing Date); _provided_   _that_ , in no event shall the amount of Escrow Cash released from the Escrow Account in respect of indemnification payments so required from such Non-Accredited Holder exceed such Non-Accredited Holders Non-Accredited Pro Rata Share of such Escrow Cash; and then, to the extent any amounts remain owing, such amounts shall be payable directly by such Non-Accredited Holder;  _provided_ _further_ _that_ , notwithstanding anything in _Section 12.3(b)(i)(B)_ to the contrary, if such Non-Accredited Holder is a Brewer Holder, any amounts that remain owing in excess of such Non-Accredited Holders Non-Accredited Pro Rata Share of such Escrow Cash, or, if no Escrow Cash is then held for the account of such Non-Accredited Holder either because all such cash has been released or because the Escrow Account has been terminated, then any amounts that remain owing by such Non-Accredited Holder shall additionally be payable directly by Brewer on behalf of such Non-Accredited Holder, and, in any such case, such Non-Accredited Holder shall thereafter reimburse and indemnify Brewer for any such amounts as are paid by Brewer on such Non-Accredited Holders behalf and for any Losses incurred by Brewer in connection therewith. 

   

 (c) For the avoidance of doubt, Brewer shall be jointly and severally liable with any Brewer Holder for all purposes of this _Article XII_ as to indemnification claims involving payments or potential payments by Brewer on behalf of a Brewer Holder pursuant to this _Section 12.6_ , and a Buyer Indemnified Party may proceed directly against Brewer in respect of any such claim without the necessity of first proceeding against such Brewer Holder (except to the extent such Brewer Holder has Escrow Shares or Escrow Cash in the Escrow Account, in which case such Buyer Indemnified Partys indemnity claim shall first be satisfied out of such Escrow Shares or Escrow Cash, as contemplated by clauses (a) and (b) of this _Section 12.6_). 

   

 (d) If amounts are owed to a Buyer Indemnified Party from the Seller Indemnified Parties and such amounts are to be paid from Escrow Shares or Escrow Cash, the Agent shall promptly execute a Joint Instruction Letter in respect of such amounts and cooperate with such Buyer Indemnified Party in delivering such Joint Instruction Letter to the Escrow Agent. If amounts remain owing to a Buyer Indemnified Party from a Holder or Brewer pursuant to clauses (a) or (b) of this  _Section 12.6_, the Agent shall, within five Business Days of written request by such Buyer Indemnified Party, prepare and transmit to each Holder from whom amounts are due and, if applicable, Brewer, a written notice demanding payment of such amounts, which amounts shall be payable by such Holder and, if applicable, Brewer, within 10 Business Days of the giving of such notice, in immediately available funds, to an account specified by the Buyer Indemnified Party in such notice. 

  

 12.7 _Non-Third-Party Claim Procedures_. If any Indemnified Party shall claim indemnification hereunder for any matter (other than a Third-Party Claim), the Indemnified Party 

      ##### 

  

      

shall promptly give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the applicable
Indemnifying Party setting forth the basis for such claim and the nature and
estimated amount of the claim (to the extent then known by the Indemnified
Party), all in reasonable detail. No delay or failure on the part of the
Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation hereunder except to the
extent of any damage or liability caused by or arising out of such delay or
failure. Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying
Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a response, in which
the Indemnifying Party shall either: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive all of the claimed amount (in which case the response
shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party of such amount, by check or by wire transfer;  _provided_
_that_ if such amount is to be paid through the release of Escrow Shares
or Escrow Cash, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cause
the Agent and the Buyer Parties (as applicable) to deliver to the Escrow
Agent, within three Business Days following the delivery of such response, a
Joint Instruction Letter instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer Parties
an amount of Escrow Funds equal to such claimed amount), (ii) agree that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive a portion of the claimed amount (in
which case the response shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party of the amount so agreed upon, by check or by
wire transfer; _provided_ _that_ if such amount is to be paid through the
release of Escrow Shares or Escrow Cash, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall cause the Agent and the Buyer Parties (as applicable)
to deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three Business Days following the
delivery of the response, a Joint Instruction Letter instructing the Escrow
Agent to pay to Buyer Parties an amount of Escrow Funds equal to such
agreed upon amount) or (iii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled
to receive all of the claimed amount. Acceptance by Buyer Parties of partial
payment of any claimed amount shall be without prejudice to Buyer Parties
right to claim the balance of any such claimed amount. 

  

 12.8 _Third-Party Claim Procedures_. 

    

 (a) If any Indemnified Party shall claim indemnification hereunder arising from any claim or demand of a third party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall promptly after it receives written notification of such Third-Party Claim, give written notice (a " _Third-Party Notice_ ") to the applicable Indemnifying Party setting forth the basis for such Third-Party Claim and the nature and estimated amount of such Third-Party Claim (to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party) in reasonable detail, together with a copy of the written notification of such Third-Party Claim. No delay or failure on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation hereunder except to the extent of any damage or liability caused by or arising out of such delay or failure. Within 30 days after receiving such Third-Party Notice, the Indemnifying Party, upon notice to the Indemnified Party, may, at its own cost and through counsel of its own choosing, defend any claim or demand set forth in a Third-Party Notice; _provided_ _that_ (i) the Indemnifying Party may only assume control of such defense if (A) it acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that any damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against the Indemnifying Party in connection with such Third-Party Claim constitute Losses for which the Indemnifying Party shall be indemnified pursuant to this _Article XII_ and (B) the damages sought in such Third-Party Claim, taken together with the estimated costs of defense thereof and the amount claimed by the Indemnified Parties with respect to any unresolved claims for indemnification then pending, is not greater than the then remaining obligation of the 

   ##### 

  

   

Indemnifying Party hereunder (taking into account the limitations on liability
described in  _Section 12.3_) and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may not assume
control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim involving Taxes (other than
Seller Taxes), criminal liability or in which equitable relief is sought
against the Indemnified Party, or if an adverse resolution of the Third-Party
Claim would, in the reasonable determination of the Indemnified Party, have a
material adverse effect on the business, operations or future conduct of the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not, or is not permitted
under the terms hereof to, so assume control of the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The non-controlling
Party may participate in such defense at its own expense. The controlling
Party shall keep the non-controlling Party reasonably apprised of the status
of such Third-Party Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider in good
faith recommendations made by the non-controlling Party with respect thereto.
Each of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall, promptly upon
the others reasonable request therefor, furnish such information as it may
have with respect to such Third-Party Claim (including copies of any summons,
complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any
written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or
asserting the same), make documents available for inspection and copying,
make employees available for interviews, depositions and trial, and otherwise
cooperate with and assist the controlling Party in the defense of such Third-
Party Claim, all of the foregoing subject to the receipt of reasonable prior
notice and the reimbursement of the reasonable out of pocket expenses of the
Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party. The reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel to the Indemnified Party with respect to a Third-Party Claim shall
be considered Losses for purposes of this Agreement if and to the extent (i)
the Indemnified Party controls the defense of such Third-Party Claim pursuant
to the terms of this  _Section 12.8(a)_ or (ii) the Indemnifying Party
assumes control of such defense and, in the reasonable view of outside
counsel to the Indemnifying Party, there exists a conflict between
the interests of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party or
different defenses with respect to such Third-Party Claim are available to
the Indemnified Party which are not available to the Indemnifying Party,
_provided_ _that_ the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the costs
and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in each
jurisdiction to which such Third Party Claim relates. Neither the Seller
Parties nor the Agent shall agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any Third-Party Claim without the prior written
consent of Buyer Parties, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed;  _provided_ _that_ the consent of Buyer Parties shall
not be required if the Agent, on behalf of all of the Seller Parties, agrees
in writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment
and such settlement or judgment includes a complete release of Buyer
Parties from further liability, involves only the payment of money damages or
amounts in settlement and has no other adverse effect on Buyer Parties. Buyer
Parties shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment
arising from, any such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to
all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party against the third party
making such Third-Party Claim, and the Indemnified Party will reasonably
cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party in asserting all such rights
and remedies against such third party. 

   

 (b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Lott Lawsuit constitutes a Third-Party Claim and (ii) a Claim for indemnification under _Section 12.1(b)(iv_) with respect to the Lott Lawsuit shall be deemed to have been made by the Buyer Parties as of the Effective 

   ##### 

  

   

Time for all purposes under this _Article XII_. The Parties further
acknowledge and agree that the Holders shall assume the defense of the Lott
Lawsuit pursuant to the provisions of  _Section 12.8(a)_. 

  

 12.9 _Exclusive Representations and Warranties_. 

    

 (a) THE BUYER PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT: (I) THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE V_ AND _ARTICLE VI_ AND IN ANY CERTIFICATES DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND (II) EXCEPT FOR SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER PARTIES REGARDING THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES, THE BUSINESS OR THE ACQUIRED ASSETS.

The Agent may (i) call capital from each Holder, in proportion to their Pro Rata Shares, to cover any such additional amounts, and each Holder shall deliver to the Agent its Pro Rata Share of the amount of capital called or (ii) fund such amounts out of any amount distributable to any Holder under this Agreement from and after the Closing, including any part of the Escrow Funds. If any Holder fails to fund its Pro Rata Share of such capital with 30 days of capital being called, the Agent may satisfy such payment obligation by bringing a claim against such defaulting party and/or offsetting any amount to which such defaulting party may be entitled under this Agreement (including such defaulting partys portion of the Escrow Funds) plus interest at the rate of 5% from the date such capital was due to be funded to the date satisfied. The Agent may disburse all or any portion of the Reimbursement Fund Amount whenever it chooses and, subject to the foregoing right of offset, any amount so disbursed shall be disbursed pro rata to the Holders in the same proportions and using the same methodology as other disbursements are made to the Holders, which proportions and methodology are described in _Section 13.12(c)_. Any portion of the Reimbursement Fund disbursed by the Agent to the Holders shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration unless otherwise required by applicable Laws. 

   

 (c) Any Escrow Shares received by the Agent for disbursement shall be disbursed to the Accredited Holders in whose name such Escrow Shares are issued. 

   

 (d) Any Escrow Cash received by the Agent for disbursement shall be disbursed to the Non-Accredited Holders in proportion to each Non-Accredited Holders Non-Accredited Pro Rata Share of such Escrow Cash, minus (i) any amounts of Escrow Cash previously allocated to such Non-Accredited Holder as contemplated by _Section 4.2(c)_ in respect of any indemnification obligation of such Non-Accredited Holder in this Agreement and (ii) if applicable, any amounts of Escrow Cash reserved in the Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 4.2(d)_ and allocable to such Non-Accredited Holder. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (e) Any Escrow Funds disbursed by the Agent to any of the Holders shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration unless otherwise required by applicable Laws. 

   

 (f) The Agent shall not be liable to any Holder for any act done or omitted hereunder as the Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Holders shall severally indemnify the Agent and hold the Agent harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Agents duties under this Agreement, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Agent. This right of indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement. The Holders hereby agree that the Agent shall be entitled to access the Reimbursement Fund Amount for the payment of amounts due in respect of the rights to indemnification described in _Section 13.12(f)_ if the Agent establishes that he or she is intended to such indemnification. The Buyer Parties and any other Person dealing with the Agent is entitled to rely on the actions taken by, and consents and approvals given by, the Agent without the need for further investigation. The Buyer Parties and any other Person shall be entitled to rely on the Agents actions, consents and approvals notwithstanding any knowledge of the relying Person. Neither the Buyer Parties nor any other Person shall have any liability for relying on the Agent in the foregoing manner. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of criminal activity or Fraud, the Agent shall not be liable to the Buyer Parties for monetary damages for actions taken in his capacity as the Agent, and no Buyer Indemnified Party shall make any claim for such damages against the Agent. 

   

 (g) If the Agent becomes unable or unwilling to serve as an Agent, such other Person or Persons as may be designated by a majority of the Holders, based on each Holders Pro Rata Share, shall succeed such Person as Agent. If the Agent should at any time become unwilling to serve as an Agent, it promptly shall so notify the Holders in writing, and shall bear no liability of any kind or nature whatsoever as a consequence of such determination. In addition, at any time as determined in the sole discretion of the Agent, the Agent may decline to take any action, make any determination, or otherwise bear any expense without having first obtained the approval or consent of holders of a majority of the Holders, based on each Holders Pro Rata Share. 

   

 (h) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that (i) the duties and obligations undertaken by the Agent pursuant to this Agreement are undertaken by the Agent in an agency capacity, (ii) such duties and obligations are duties and obligations of the Holders, and the Holders shall cause the Agent to perform and fulfill all such duties and obligations, and (iii) references in this Agreement to the Agent (other than in this _Section 13.12_) are included merely for the economy and not because the Agent is the sole obligor of such duties and obligations. 

  

 13.13 _Guaranty_. Parent hereby, unconditionally and irrevocably, guarantees (this " _Guaranty_ "), by way of an independent obligation to the Seller Parties (a) the due, prompt and faithful performance by each Merger Sub of all undertakings, obligations, required acts and performances of such Merger Sub to the Seller Parties under or arising out of the obligations of 

      ##### 

  

    

such Merger Sub under each Transaction Document; and (ii) the due and punctual
payment of all amounts due and payable by each Merger Sub to the Seller
Parties under or arising out of the obligations of such Merger Sub under each
Transaction Document after the Execution Date, when and as the same shall
arise and become due and payable in accordance with the terms of and subject
to the conditions contained in such Transaction Document (the " _Guaranteed
Obligations_ "). Parent guarantees as principal obligor and not as surety the
prompt performance and payment of all Guaranteed Obligations, this being a
guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection. This Guaranty is not
contingent upon the pursuit by the Seller Parties of any rights or remedies
against either Merger Sub, such pursuit being hereby waived by Parent. The
obligations, covenants, agreements and duties of Parent hereunder shall not
be released, affected or impaired in any way by the voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, sale or disposition of any assets of either Merger Sub, or the
merger or consolidation of either Merger Sub with any other Person. This
Guaranty shall be binding upon all successors and assigns of Parent. 

   

 13.14 _Role of Acquired Company Counsel; Waiver of Conflicts and Privilege_. 

    

 (a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that in connection with the matters related to this Agreement, Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. and Fishman Haygood Phelps Walmsley Willis and Swanson, L.L.P. solely represented the Acquired Companies and did not represent any of the Holders or any officer, employee, director or manager of any Acquired Company individually. 

   

 (b) Each of the Buyer Parties waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause each Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to waive and to not assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the potential representation, after the Closing (the " _Post Closing Representation_ "), of any Holder or any officer, employee, director or manager of either Acquired Company (any such Person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any matter involving this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, by any legal counsel (including Vinson and Elkins L.L.P.) currently representing either Acquired Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Current Representation_ "). 

   

 (c) Each of the Buyer Parties waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause each Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to waive and to not assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between any such legal counsel (including Vinson and Elkins L.L.P.) and any Designated Person occurring during the Current Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute with any Buyer Party and, following the Closing, with either Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries, it being the intention of the Parties that following the Closing all such rights to such attorney-client privilege and to control such attorney-client privilege shall be exclusively vested in and belong to the Holders; _provided_ _that_ the foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to (i) any communication not involving this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to communications with any Person other than the Designated Persons and their advisors and (ii) matters involving a third party as to which Buyer Parties, the Surviving Entities and their Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall be permitted to assert the attorney-client privilege. 

   ##### 

  

  

 13.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. Facsimile or scanned and emailed transmission of any signed original document or retransmission of any signed facsimile or scanned and emailed transmission will be deemed the same as delivery of an original. At the request of any Party, the Parties will confirm facsimile or scanned and emailed transmission by signing a duplicate original document. 

   

 13.16 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. 

    

 (a) This Agreement, together with all Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules hereto, the other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreements constitute the entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties, including the Term Letter dated May 17, 2011. 

   

 (b) This Agreement may be amended, modified, supplemented or restated, and any of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument executed by the Buyer Parties and the Agent or, in the case of a waiver, by or on behalf of the Buyer Parties (if any Buyer Party is waiving compliance) or the Agent (if the Seller Parties are waiving compliance). The failure of any Party at any time or times to require performance of any provisions hereof will in no manner affect the right at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by any Party of any condition, or of any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, will be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or of any breach of any other term, covenant, representation or warranty. 

  

 13.17 _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement.
