 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tOWNER JV acknowledges and agrees that the Hotel and the
Property are being sold to OWNER JV, and that OWNER JV agrees to purchase and
accept the Hotel and the Property, and each and every part and component
thereof, in an "AS IS, WHERE IS" condition as of the Closing with no
representations or warranties from Hersha Owner or Hersha Lessee, either
express or implied, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the
Conveyance Documents. OWNER JV agrees that OWNER JV is not relying upon, and
has not received or been given, any representations, statements or warranties,
oral or written, implied or express (except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement or in the Conveyance Documents), of or by any officer, employee,
agent or representative of Hersha Owner, Hersha Lessee, the Hersha Members,
Hotel Manager or any salesperson or broker (if any) involved in the
transactions contemplated hereby, as to the Hotel or the Property or any part
or component thereof in any respect, including, but not limited to, any

and assigns, waives any right to assert any claim or demand against Hersha
Owner, Hersha Lessee, the Hersha Members, Hotel Manager or their respective
affiliates at law or in equity relating to any such matter, whether latent or
patent, disclosed or undisclosed, known or unknown, now existing or hereafter
arising. Except for any title or survey matters created solely by Hersha
Owner or Hersha Lessee in violation of Section 4.3 of this Agreement, OWNER JV
agrees that (except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Conveyance
Documents) it shall have no recourse whatsoever against Hersha Owner, Hersha
Lessee, the Hersha Members, Hotel Manager, or their respective Affiliates, at
law or in equity, should the Survey, the Title Commitment or the Title Policy
fail to disclose any matter affecting the Real Property or reveal any such
matter in an inaccurate, misleading or incomplete fashion or otherwise be in
error. OWNER JV acknowledges that has reviewed the Survey and the Title
Commitment (as same may be marked at Closing) and discussed their contents
with the independent contractors who prepared or issued each of them. OWNER
JV accordingly agrees to look solely to the preparer of the Survey and the
Title Company for any claim arising out of or in connection with such
instruments and hereby releases Hersha Owner, Hersha Lessee, the Hersha
Members, Hotel Manager and their respective Affiliates from any such claim
(except for any claim that Hersha Owner agrees to cure as set forth in this
Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein is intended to
limit the liability of Hersha Owner, Hersha Lessee or any Hersha Member for
any breach of a covenant or other undertaking set forth in this Agreement or
in any Conveyance Document.

 \t\t\t\tARTICLE 3 \t\t\t 

APPORTIONMENTS AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 3.1 \t\t\tGeneral. All items of revenue and expense with respect
to the Property, and applicable to the period of time before and after Closing
Date, shall be allocated between Hersha Owner and Owner JV as provided herein.
Pursuant to such allocation and subject to Section 3.1(g), Hersha Owner or
Hersha Lessee, as applicable, shall be entitled to all revenue (including,
without limitation, the Excluded Receivables) and shall be responsible for all
expenses for the period of time up to 11:59 P.M. (Eastern Standard Time) on
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Adjustment Point"), and
Owner JV or Lessee JV, as applicable, shall be entitled to all revenue and
shall be responsible for all expenses, in each case, which accrue and are
attributable to the period of time after the Adjustment Point. Such
adjustments shall be shown on the closing statement or settlement statement
prepared by the Escrow Agent at the Closing (the "Closing Statement"), with
such supporting documentation as the Parties may reasonably require being
attached as exhibits to the Closing Statement and shall increase or decrease
(as the case may be) the cash amount payable by Owner JV. The Closing
Statement shall be in form and content acceptable to the Parties prior to and
as a condition to the Closing. All prorations shall be made on the basis of
the actual number of days in the year and  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t13  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

month in which the Closing occurs or in the period of computation. Except as
otherwise specifically provided for herein, all apportionments shall be made
in the manner recommended by the "Customs in Respect to Title Closings" of the
Real Estate Board of New York, Inc. and there shall be no other
apportionments. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
following items shall be allocated and prorated as of the Adjustment Point: 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tReal Estate Taxes, Personal Property Taxes and
Assessments. Real estate taxes, personal property taxes, and assessments (and
refunds thereof) on the basis of the fiscal year or fiscal years for which
assessed. If the Closing shall occur before a new real property tax rate,
personal property tax rate, or assessed valuation is fixed, the apportionment
of such tax at Closing shall be upon the basis of the old tax rate for the
preceding fiscal year applied to the latest assessed valuation. Promptly after
the actual real estate taxes and personal property taxes have been fixed, the
apportionment of taxes shall be recomputed and Hersha Owner or Owner JV, as
the case may be, promptly upon demand shall make a payment to the other based
upon the recomputed apportionment. In addition, if any real property
assessment or personal property assessment affects the Hotel as of the Closing
Date and such real property assessment or personal property assessment is
payable in annual or other installments (whether at the election of Hersha
Owner or otherwise), only the installment relating to, or payable over, the
fiscal period of the assessing authority, part of which is included within the
period prior to the Closing Date and part of which is included in the period
after the Closing Date, shall be apportioned between Hersha Owner and Owner JV
as of the Adjustment Point; however, such assessments which are not payable in
installments shall be paid by Hersha Owner at Closing where the work has been
completed, and shall be assumed by Owner JV at Closing and shall be
apportioned between Hersha Owner and Owner JV as of the Adjustment Point where
the work has been authorized or started, but not completed. Hersha Owner may
have previously filed, and shall have the right at any time to file, an action
for the adjustment of taxes payable for any tax year during which Hersha Owner
has any liability (including the tax year of Closing and any prior tax years).
If Hersha Owner files (or has previously filed) such an action affecting any
tax year prior to the year of Closing, any tax savings or refunds resulting
from such action shall be solely the property of Hersha Owner. Hersha Owner
shall have the exclusive right (at its sole cost and expense) to file, and
control, any filing or tax appeals for an adjustment of taxes affecting the
tax year in which the Closing occurs, provided, that, such filing or appeal
does not have a material adverse effect on the Owner JV, Lessee JV or the
Property. If Hersha Owner should file an action for an adjustment of taxes
affecting the tax year in which the Closing occurs, and if as a result thereof
taxes for said tax year are reduced, then any tax savings or refunds and the
third party costs reasonably incurred to achieve the tax savings or refunds
shall be prorated between Hersha Owner and Owner JV effective as of the
Closing Date. Owner JV acknowledges that Hersha Owner has the sole right to
file and control, and Owner JV agrees to reasonably cooperate with Hersha
Owner (at the sole cost and expense of Hersha Owner) in connection with any
action for the adjustment of taxes. The provisions of this paragraph shall
survive the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Hersha
Owner be obligated to pay any additional taxes due with respect to any
reassessment of the Property which results from the sale of the Property to
Owner JV or any improvements to the Property made by Owner JV, and Owner JV
acknowledges and agrees that it shall be liable for all such additional taxes. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tUtilities. Utilities and fuel charges, including,
without limitation, water, sewer, steam, electricity, gas and oil charges, on

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t14  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

contemporaneously as possible to the Adjustment Point (or, if not possible, on
the basis of the most recent previous bills and readings); provided, that upon
the taking of subsequent meter readings that are closer in time to the
Adjustment Point, then such adjustment shall be recalculated based upon the
subsequent readings, and Hersha Owner or Owner JV, as the case may be,
promptly upon demand, shall make any necessary compensating payments to the
other Party. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tEscrows and Deposits. All escrows or similar deposits,
if any, made by Hersha Owner as security under any public service contracts
which will remain on deposit for the benefit of Owner JV after the Closing to
the extent such escrows or similar deposits are assigned to Owner JV for which
Hersha Owner will receive a credit at Closing. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tAccounts Receivable. Hersha Owner shall retain
ownership of all Excluded Receivables and shall have the right to
independently collect the Excluded Receivables after the Closing (at its sole
cost and expenses), provided, that, such collection efforts do not have a
material adverse effect on the Owner JV, Lessee JV or the Property. Owner JV
shall reasonably cooperate with Hersha Owner (at the sole cost and expense of
Hersha Owner) with regard to the collection of the Excluded Receivables, and
shall promptly remit to Hersha Owner any and all amounts collected by Owner JV
with respect to the Excluded Receivables, together with an accounting thereof. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tContracts. Fees and regular charges payable under, or
prepaid amounts under, the Contracts to which Hersha Owner is a party and
relating to Hersha Owner's operations at the Hotels if such Contracts are
being assigned to Owner JV or Lessee JV, as applicable, and are to continue
after the Closing. In addition, Hersha Owner and Owner JV agree that expenses
under Contracts which will constitute ongoing construction, capital
improvement and other similar work shall be allocated to Hersha Owner as to
work completed prior to the Adjustment Point (and applicable retainage related
thereto), and shall be allocated to Owner JV as to work completed from and
after the Adjustment Point (and applicable retainage related thereto). Except
as expressly provided for herein or in the Conveyance Documents, Owner JV and
Lessee JV shall not be obligated to assume any of the liabilities or
obligations of Hersha Owner and Hersha Lessee which accrued or are
attributable to the period prior to the Adjustment Point. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tAnnual Fees for Authorizations. Annual fees for

registered guests (who have not checked out and were occupying rooms as of the
Adjustment Point), including any sales taxes, room taxes, occupancy taxes or
other taxes thereon for nights prior to the Adjustment Point shall be credited
to Hersha Owner at Closing. The room's revenue and applicable taxes for the
night preceding Closing shall be apportioned equally between Owner JV and
Hersha Owner.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tIf the estimated cost of the Immediate Work is greater
than (i) $150,000 (in the aggregate) with respect to the Hotel or (ii)
$700,000 (in the aggregate) with respect to the Hotel and each Other Property,
then and only then, Hersha Owner shall have the obligation, and hereby
covenants and agrees, to diligently pursue and complete the Immediate Work to
the reasonable satisfaction of Owner JV within the earlier of twelve (12)
months of the Closing Date or the time period required by any lender providing
the Senior Financing pursuant and in accordance with the loan documents
evidencing such Senior Financing, and if and to the extent that any such
lender requires the funding of a reserve at Closing to pay for the Immediate
Work, then Hersha Owner shall be obligated to fund such reserve subject to and
in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Section 3.9. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tNotwithstanding the foregoing subsection (a) or anything
to the contrary herein, if the estimated cost of the Immediate Work is more
than $7,000,000 (in the aggregate) for the Hotel and each Other Property, then
Hersha Owner shall have the unilateral right, in its sole discretion, prior to
the scheduled Closing Date, to terminate this Agreement and the Other APCA's
(which right must be exercised by Hersha Owner with respect to this Agreement
and by each Other Seller with respect to each Other APCA, simultaneously in
writing, and cannot be exercised individually by Hersha Owner or any Other
Seller), and in such instance, the entire Deposit shall be promptly returned
to Owner JV, Hersha Owner shall reimburse to Owner JV the Owner JV's Pursuit
Costs (exclusive of any amounts funded by Hersha Owner or its Affiliates), and
all rights, obligations and liabilities of the Parties hereunder shall be
released and discharged except for those obligations and rights which by their
terms survive termination of this Agreement. If Hersha Owner does not so
elect to terminate this Agreement together with each Other Seller not electing
to terminate the Other APCAs, Hersha Owner shall be obligated to complete the
Immediate Work at its sole cost and expense regardless of whether the total
cost to complete the Immediate Work exceeds $7,000,000. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tIf the estimated cost of the Immediate Work is less than
$150,000 (in the aggregate) with respect to the Hotel, then Hersha Owner shall
have no obligation to pursue or complete such repair or remediation, and any
repair or remediation recommendation contained in any such Third Party Report
shall not impact Closing or the satisfaction of any condition precedent to
Closing contained in this Agreement or in any Other APCA, unless the estimated
cost of the Immediate Work with respect the Hotel and each Other Property is
greater than $700,000 (in the aggregate), in which event Hersha Owner shall be
obligated to complete the Immediate Work (at its sole cost and expense)
subject to and in accordance with subsection (a) above.

and independent third party property inspector (at its sole cost and expense)
to review and assess the estimated cost of the Immediate Work as provided for
in the Third Party Report or as may be required by a lender under the Senior
Financing, and to seek actual contractor bids for the recommended Immediate
Work, which bids shall control the determination of the estimated cost of the
Immediate Work, a copy of which report and bids shall be provided by Hersha
Owner to Owner  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t19  \t\t

JV promptly upon receipt thereof. If the actual costs of completing the
Immediate Work exceed the bids obtained by Hersha Owner, Hersha Owner shall be
solely responsible for all such costs and expenses in excess of the bids.

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tHersha Hospitality Limited Partnership, by its Joinder

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tRegardless of whether Hersha Owner is obligated or
elects to pursue and complete the Immediate Work in accordance with this
Section 3.9, in no event shall there be a reduction in the Purchase Price, and
Owner JV shall be obligated to consummate the transactions contemplated herein
subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 4.1 \t\t\tTitle Commitment and Survey. Owner JV has received,

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

Exceptions" shall mean (i) the specific exceptions (excluding exceptions that
are part of the promulgated title insurance form) in the Title Commitment that
the Owner JV has approved as permitted exceptions in accordance with a mark-up
of the Title Commitment attached hereto as Schedule 4.2; (ii) matters created
by, through or under Owner JV; (iii) items shown on the Survey; (iv) real

case that are not yet due and payable as of the Closing but may become or give

---|--- 

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t20  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tany liens, encumbrances or other defects or exceptions
to title insurance coverage caused by Owner JV, by any of its affiliates, by

 \t\t\t\t 4.3 \t\t\tNew Exceptions to Title. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tOwner JV's Objections. To the extent the Real Property
is involuntarily encumbered after the Effective Date and prior to the Closing
without the approval of Owner JV, and such encumbrance (i) is not a Permitted
Exception, and (ii) materially and adversely affects Hersha Owner's title to
the Real Property (a "New Exception"), upon receipt of written notice by Owner
JV of any such New Exception (including a copy of the related agreement, if
applicable), Owner JV shall have five (5) Business Days (but not later than
the Closing Date for any New Exceptions disclosed within five (5) Business
Days of the Closing) to review such New Exception and provide written notice
to Hersha Owner with any objections to such New Exception (the ''Owner JV's
Objections"); provided, however, Owner JV agrees that it shall not have the
right to object to any of the matters described in Section 4.2 that constitute
Permitted Exceptions. Unless Owner JV notifies Hersha Owner in writing that it
objects to a New Exception within the foregoing time period, each such New
Exception shall automatically constitute a Permitted Exception. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tHersha Owner's Response. Not later than five (5)
Business Days after receipt of Owner JV's Objection, but in any event prior
to the Closing Date, Hersha Owner shall in its sole discretion, either: (i)
notify Owner JV of its intention (the "Hersha Owner's Response") to attempt to
Remove, as defined herein, the New Exception(s) listed in the Owner JV's
Objections, or (ii) notify Owner JV that Hersha Owner does not intend to
attempt to Remove any such matter. If Hersha Owner does not provide Hersha
Owner's Response to Owner JV within such time period, Hersha Owner shall be
deemed to have elected not to attempt to Remove Owner JV's Objections. If
Hersha Owner elects (or is deemed to have elected) not to Remove one or more
of the New Exceptions, then not more than five (5) Business Days after receipt
of Hersha Owner's Response (but in any event not later than the Closing Date),
Owner JV shall by written notice to Hersha Owner either: (x) terminate this
Agreement, or (y) waive the existence of such New Exception, in which case,
any such New Exception shall automatically constitute a Permitted Exception.
Owner JV's failure to respond within said five (5)-Business Day period shall
constitute Owner JV's election to proceed under clause (y). If Hersha Owner
elects to attempt to Remove any New Exception, then Hersha Owner shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to cure any such New Exception on
or before the Closing Date. If  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t21  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

at any time Hersha Owner notifies Owner JV that Hersha Owner will be unable or
is unwilling to cure any such New Exception, then Owner JV shall, within five
(5) Business Days after receipt of such notification, either terminate this
Agreement or waive any such New Exception, in which case, any such New
Exception shall automatically constitute a Permitted Exception. Owner JV's
failure to respond to Hersha Owner's notice within such five (5)-Business Day
period shall constitute Owner JV's decision to waive the existence of such New
Exception, in which case, any such New Exception shall automatically
constitute a Permitted Exception, and proceed to Closing in accordance with
this Agreement. In no event shall Owner JV be entitled to a reduction of the
Purchase Price on account of any uncured New Exception. In any case where this
Agreement is terminated as permitted in this paragraph, then the entire
Deposit shall be promptly returned to Owner JV, and all rights, obligations
and liabilities of the Parties hereunder shall be released and discharged
except for those obligations and rights which by their express terms survive
termination of this Agreement. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tRemoval of New Exceptions. As used in this Agreement,
"Remove" shall mean that Hersha Owner in its discretion will either (i) take
such actions as are necessary to eliminate (of record or otherwise, as
appropriate) the New Exception, (ii) cause the Title Company to remove the New
Exception as an exception to the owner's policy of title insurance and
affirmatively insure against the same in form and content acceptable to Owner
JV, whether such insurance is made available in consideration of payment,
bonding, indemnity of Hersha Owner or otherwise, or (iii) deliver its own
funds to the Title Company with instructions for the Title Company to apply
such funds to discharge fully the New Exception on or prior to the Closing
Date, together with such instruments, in recordable form, as are necessary to
enable the Title Company to discharge the New Exception of record and funds
necessary to cover the fees and expenses of the Title Company for discharging
the claim and recording or filing such instruments.

 \t\t\t\t 4.4 \t\t\tCondemnation. In the event that any Governmental
Authority commences condemnation proceedings, taking by power of eminent
domain or any similar action (such action, a "Condemnation") with respect to
the Property or any Material Portion thereof, Owner JV may, at its option, by
written notice to Hersha Owner given prior to the earlier of (i) the Closing
Date, and (ii) ten (10) Business Days after Hersha Owner notifies Owner JV of
such action, either: (x) terminate this Agreement, in which case the entire
Deposit shall be promptly returned to Owner JV and the Parties hereto shall
have no further rights or obligations, other than those that by their express
terms survive the termination of this Agreement, or (y) proceed under this
Agreement, in which event Hersha Owner shall, at the Closing, irrevocably
assign to Owner JV its entire right, title and interest in and to any
condemnation award, or credit the Purchase Price in the amount of any award
received by Hersha Owner between the Effective Date and the Closing Date less
any collection costs, and Owner JV shall have the sole right after the Closing
to negotiate and otherwise deal with the condemning authority in respect of
such matter. If Owner JV does not give Hersha Owner written notice of its
election within the time required above, then Owner JV shall be deemed to have
elected option (y) above, For the purpose of this Agreement, "Material
Portion" means a taking of the Property which, as a result of the taking, in
Hersha Owner's reasonable estimation as reviewed and confirmed in good faith
by Owner JV, will result in a decrease in value of the Property equal to or
exceeding ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price.

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tCasualty Notice. If prior to Closing, the Property is
damaged by fire or other casualty, Hersha Owner shall reasonably estimate the
cost to repair and the time required to complete repairs and will provide
Owner JV written notice of Hersha Owner's estimation and supporting
documentation (the "Casualty Notice") as soon as reasonably possible after the
occurrence of the casualty but in any event within ten (10) Business Days of
the casualty event. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tMaterial. In the event of any Material Damage, as
defined herein, to or destruction of the Property or any portion thereof prior
to Closing, either Hersha Owner or Owner JV may, at its option, terminate this
Agreement by delivering written notice to the other on or before the
expiration of ten (10) Business Days after the date Hersha Owner delivers the
Casualty Notice to Owner JV (and if necessary, the Closing Date shall be
extended to give the Parties the full ten (10) Business Day period to make
such election and to obtain insurance settlement agreements with Hersha
Owner's insurers). Upon any such termination, the entire Deposit shall be
promptly returned to Owner JV and the Parties shall have no further rights or
obligations hereunder, other than those that by their express terms survive
the termination of this Agreement. If neither Hersha Owner nor Owner JV so
terminates this Agreement within said ten (10)-Business Day period, then the
Parties shall proceed under this Agreement and close on schedule (subject to
extension of Closing as provided above), and as of Closing, Hersha Owner shall
assign to Owner JV, without representation or warranty by or recourse against
Hersha Owner, all of Hersha Owner's rights in and to any resulting insurance
proceeds due Hersha Owner as a result of such damage or destruction (the
"Insurance Proceeds") and Owner JV shall assume full responsibility for all
needed repairs, and Owner JV shall receive a credit at Closing for any
deductible amount under such insurance policies (but the amount of the
deductible plus insurance proceeds shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the cost
of repair or (ii) the Purchase Price); provided, however, Hersha Owner shall
retain the claim against the insurance company and the right to negotiate and
settle with the insurance company regarding the claim, but Hersha Owner agrees
to use good faith efforts to cooperate with Owner JV, shall keep Owner JV
reasonably informed as to the status of the claim, and shall not agree to the
amount of the Insurance Proceeds with the insurance company without providing
prior written notice thereof to Owner JV and consulting with Owner JV. For the
purposes of this Agreement, "Material Damage" and "Materially Damaged" means
damage which, in Hersha Owner's reasonable estimation as reviewed and
confirmed in good faith by Owner JV, equals or exceeds ten percent (10%) of
the Purchase Price. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tImmaterial. If the Property is not Materially Damaged,
then neither Owner JV nor Hersha Owner shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement, and Hersha Owner shall, at its option, either (i) repair the damage
before the Closing to the reasonable, good faith satisfaction of Owner JV, or
(ii) credit Owner JV at Closing to the good faith satisfaction of Owner JV for
the reasonable costs to complete the repair as reviewed and confirmed in good
faith by Owner JV (in which case Hersha Owner shall retain all insurance
proceeds and Owner JV shall assume full responsibility for all needed
repairs).

approved by Lessee JV. Prior to or immediately following the Effective Date,
Lessee JV shall submit its application and application fee to Franchisor for

Approval") pursuant a New Franchise Agreement. Hersha Owner and Hersha Lessee
agree to reasonably cooperate with and assist Lessee JV in its pursuit of
Franchise Approval, at no material cost to Hersha Owner or Hersha Lessee.
Franchise Approval shall be a condition to Hersha Owner's and Hersha Lessee's
obligation to close and Owner JV's and Lessee JV's obligation to close.
Owner JV and Lessee JV shall use diligent good faith efforts to obtain
Franchise Approval no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date,

Hersha Owner and Hersha Lessee shall have the right from time to time prior to
Closing by notice to Owner JV within five (5) Business Days of Hersha Owner's
or Hersha Lessee's actual knowledge thereof, and without liability therefor,
to amend or supplement its qualifications to the representations and
warranties in Section 8.2, by amendment of the Schedules hereto or otherwise,
to reflect changes in facts or to correct any immaterial factual inaccuracies
which arise subsequent to the Effective Date; provided, however, that any such
amendment or supplement, if adverse to Owner JV, may constitute the non-
fulfillment of the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b), in which case Owner
JV may elect to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3 and Owner JV
shall be entitled to receive a return of the Deposit in accordance with
Section 2.2(c). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tHersha Owner's Representations Deemed Modified. To the
extent that Owner JV or Lessee JV actually knows at or prior to Closing that
any of Hersha Owner's or Hersha Lessee's representations and warranties are
inaccurate, untrue or incorrect in any way, such representations and
warranties shall be deemed modified to reflect Owner JV's and Lessee JV's
knowledge. No Hersha Owner or Hersha Lessee representation shall be deemed to
have been breached (or made untrue) by reason of any inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty if and to the extent that such inaccuracy has been
identified by Hersha Owner or Hersha Lessee to Owner JV or Lessee JV in
writing or otherwise is actually known by Owner JV or Lessee JV prior to
Closing and Owner JV and Lessee JV nevertheless consummate the Closing. For
purposes of this Agreement, both Owner JV and Lessee JV shall be deemed to
actually know that a representation or warranty is untrue, inaccurate or
incorrect if and to the extent that (i) the facts or circumstances that render
such representation or warranty untrue, inaccurate or incorrect were expressly
disclosed in the due diligence materials deposited into Broker's data room
prior to the Effective Date, or (ii) this Agreement, any Exhibit or Schedule
attached hereto, any study, test, report, or analyses delivered to or prepared
by or for Owner JV or any of Owner JV's  \t\t

  \t\t\t38  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Representatives, or otherwise obtained by Owner JV or any Owner JV's
Representative contains information which is inconsistent with such
representation or warranty. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tNotice of Breach; Hersha Owner's Right to Cure. If
after the Effective Date and prior to Closing, Owner JV or Lessee JV becomes
aware or is deemed to know that any of the representations or warranties made
herein by Hersha Owner or Hersha Lessee are materially untrue, inaccurate or
incorrect (other than as a result of receipt of written notice thereof from
Hersha Owner or Hersha Lessee pursuant to the requirement of the next
sentence), Owner JV shall promptly notify Hersha Owner of the same in writing
and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days of obtaining such actual
knowledge. In such event, neither Hersha Owner nor Hersha Lessee shall be
obligated to cure any such misrepresentation or breach, but may elect to by
written notice to Owner JV. If Hersha Owner or Hersha Lessee is otherwise
willing to attempt to cure the misrepresentation or breach, Hersha Owner shall
be entitled to a reasonable adjournment of the Closing (not to exceed ninety
(90) days) for the purpose of any such cure, provided, however, Owner JV shall
have the right to waive such breach at any time during said period of
adjournment and in the event of such waiver Hersha Owner and Hersha Lessee (on
the one hand) and Owner JV and Lessee JV (on the other hand) shall consummate
the Closing without any reduction or credit against the Purchase Price with
respect thereto. If Hersha Owner or Hersha Lessee fail to cure any
misrepresentation or breach to the reasonable satisfaction of Owner JV or
declines to cure any other misrepresentation or breach not required to be
cured, then Owner JV, as its sole remedy for any and all such materially
untrue, inaccurate or incorrect material representations or warranties, shall
be entitled to terminate this Agreement by giving Hersha Owner written notice
thereof whereupon the entire Deposit shall be returned to Owner JV as set
forth in Section 9.3, provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, solely
with respect to a material misrepresentation or breach by Hersha Owner or
Hersha Lessee hereunder, Hersha Owner shall reimburse Owner JV for all
reasonable, third party, out-of-pocket costs and expenses actually incurred by
Owner JV in connection with Owner JVs efforts to acquire the Property,
including, without limitation, all due diligence costs, reasonable legal
expenses, and financing expenses, which total reimbursement shall be capped at
$400,000 in the aggregate (such capped costs and expenses are hereinafter
referred to as "Owner JV's Pursuit Costs"). In no event under this Section
8.3(c) shall Hersha Owner or Hersha Lessee be liable to Owner JV or Lessee LV
for any actual (except for Owner JV's Pursuit Costs), consequential, punitive,
treble, exemplary, speculative or other damages. If any representation or
warranty is untrue, inaccurate or incorrect but is not untrue, inaccurate or
incorrect in any material respect, Owner JV and Lessee JV shall be deemed to
waive such misrepresentation or breach of warranty, and Owner JV and Lessee JV
shall be required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby without
any reduction of or credit against the Purchase Price. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tLimitation on Hersha Owner's and Hersha Lessee's
Liability and Survivability. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
herein or in any document or instrument (including any deed or assignment)
executed by Hersha Owner and/or Hersha Lessee and delivered to Owner JV and
Lessee JV at or in connection with the Closing (collectively, "Closing
Documents"), the representations and warranties of Hersha Owner and Hersha
Lessee contained herein or in any Closing Document shall survive the Closing
for a period of twelve (12) months (the "Survival Period"). No claim for a
breach of any representation or warranty of Hersha Owner or Hersha Lessee
shall be actionable or payable (i) if the breach in question results from or
is based on a condition, state of facts or other matter which was known to
Owner  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t39  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

JV or Lessee JV prior to Closing, (ii) unless the valid claims for all such
breaches collectively aggregate more than Twenty-Five Thousand and 00/100
Dollars ($25,000.00), in which event the full amount of such claims shall be
actionable, and (iii) unless written notice containing a description of the
specific nature of such breach shall have been given by Owner JV to Hersha
Owner prior to the expiration of the Survival Period and an action shall have
been commenced by Owner JV against Hersha Owner within thirty (30) days after
the termination of the Survival Period. Each of Owner JV and Lessee JV agree
to first seek recovery under any insurance policies prior to seeking recovery
from Hersha Owner and Hersha Lessee, and Hersha Owner and Hersha Lessee shall
not be liable to Owner JV or Lessee JV if Owner JV's or Lessee JV's claim is
satisfied from such insurance policies. In no event shall Hersha Owner's and
Hersha Lessee's aggregate liability to Owner JV and Lessee JV for breach of
any representation or warranty of Hersha Owner or Hersha Lessee in this
Agreement exceed three percent (3%) of the Purchase Price. After the
expiration of the Survival Period, except to the extent written notice shall
have been given and an action commenced as provided above, the representations
and warranties of Hersha Owner and Hersha Lessee contained herein or in any
Closing Document shall terminate and be of no further force or effect as if
never given, and thereafter neither Hersha Owner nor Hersha Lessee shall have
(and each of Hersha Owner and Hersha Lessee is exculpated and released from
any) liability whatsoever with respect to any suits, actions, proceedings,
investigations, demands, claims, liabilities, fines, penalties, liens,
judgments, losses, injuries, damages, expenses or costs, including attorneys'
and experts' fees and costs of investigation and remediation costs under, and
Owner JV and Lessee JV shall be forever barred from making or bringing any
claims with respect to, any of the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement or in any Closing Document, unless and to the extent that
Hersha Owner or Hersha Lessee engages in fraud or willful misconduct in
connection with any such representation or warranty.

AN EFFORT TO CAUSE THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DAMAGES TO BE CERTAIN, AND THAT THE
PAYMENT OF THE DEPOSIT TO HERSHA OWNER AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES UNDER THE
CIRCUMSTANCES PROVIDED FOR HEREIN IS NOT INTENDED AS A FORFEITURE OR PENALTY,
BUT IS INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO HERSHA OWNER. BY PLACING
THEIR INITIALS BELOW, EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY CONFIRMS THE ACCURACY OF THE
STATEMENTS MADE ABOVE, THE REASONABLENESS OF THE AMOUNT OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
AGREED UPON, AND THE FACT THAT EACH PARTY WAS REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL WHO
EXPLAINED, AT THE TIME THIS AGREEMENT WAS MADE, THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISION. THE FOREGOING SHALL NOT LIMIT HERSHA OWNER'S
RIGHT TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER
SECTION OF THIS AGREEMENT, NOR WAIVE OR AFFECT ANY PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT WHICH EXPRESSLY STATE THAT THEY SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF
THIS AGREEMENT.

Agreement (including, without limitation, this Section 9.2), in the event of
Owner JV's default resulting in a termination of this Agreement, the facts
surrounding which are not otherwise being disputed by Owner JV, Hersha Owner
shall have all remedies available at law or in equity in the event Owner JV or
any party related to Owner JV or affiliated with Owner JV is asserting any
claims, costs, including attorneys' and experts' fees and costs of
investigation and remediation costs under.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in the event that Hersha Owner determines that there exists a
material risk that any amount of the Deposit Hersha Owner is entitled to
pursuant to this Article 9 would be treated as an amount that is treated as
gross income for purposes of Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), and is not gross income described Section 856(c)(2)
or 856(c)(3) of the Code ("Nonqualifying Income") for Hersha Hospitality Trust
("Hersha REIT"), which owns an indirect interest in Hersha Owner, upon the
payment of such amounts to Hersha Owner, such amounts paid to Hersha Owner
pursuant this Agreement in any tax year shall not exceed the maximum amount
that can be paid to Hersha Owner in such year without causing Hersha REIT to
fail to meet the requirements imposed on real estate investment trusts
pursuant to Sections 856 through and including 860 of the Code (the "REIT
Requirements") for such year, determined as if the payment of such amount were
Nonqualifying Income. If the amount payable for any tax year under the
preceding sentence is less than the remaining amount of the Deposit to which
Hersha Owner is entitled to pursuant to this Article 9 (together with any
interest earned thereon, the "Expense Amount"), then the Escrow Agent shall
retain the Expense Amount in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Escrow Agreement and shall not release any portion thereof to Hersha Owner,
and Hersha Owner shall not be entitled to any such amount, unless and until
(i) Hersha Owner receives (1) an opinion of Hersha REIT's tax counsel to the
effect that such amount, if and to the extent paid, would not constitute
Nonqualifying Income, (ii) a letter from Hersha REIT's independent accountants
indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to Hersha Owner
without causing Hersha REIT to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for any
relevant taxable year or (iii) a private letter ruling issued by the Internal
Revenue Service to Hersha REIT indicating that the receipt of any Expense
Amount hereunder will not cause Hersha REIT to fail to satisfy the REIT
Requirements, and (2) Hersha Owner delivers a notice to the Escrow Agent to
release such portion of the Expense Amount.

AFFILIATE OR CONTROLLING PERSON THEREOF, HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY FURTHER

 \t\t\t\t 9.3 \t\t\tHersha Owner's Default. If, on the Closing Date, Hersha
Owner or Hersha Lessee is in material default of this Agreement, Owner JV, as
its sole and exclusive remedy,  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t42  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

shall have the right to either (i) (A) terminate this Agreement by giving
Hersha Owner written notice thereof, whereupon the Deposit shall be returned
to Owner JV, and (B) if Hersha Owner's material default is the result of a
willful and intentional breach of its obligations under this Agreement, then
Owner JV shall be entitled to recover from Hersha Owner the sum of Four
Million and No/100 Dollars ($4,000,000) as liquidated damages in full
satisfaction of any and all claims against Hersha JV, Hersha Lessee and the
Hersha Members hereunder, or (ii) seek specific performance of Hersha Owner's
obligation to convey the Property pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
however, as conditions precedent to an action in specific performance, in
addition to other requirements imposed by applicable laws, and to the extent
permitted by applicable laws, Owner JV must (A) have satisfied as of the
Closing Date all conditions precedent to Hersha Owner's obligation in Section
7.2 and, as of the Closing Date, shall have been ready, willing, and able to
purchase the Property, (B) commence such legal action within thirty (30) days
of the date scheduled for Closing or forever be barred from seeking such
remedy and (C) maintain the Deposit then on deposit with Escrow Agent or the
registry of a court of competent jurisdiction during the pendency of any such
action (and Owner JV agrees the Deposit will be fully at risk should Owner JV
not prevail in such action). For the avoidance of doubt, each of Hersha Owner
and Owner JV agrees that the foregoing sentence sets forth the only remedies
available to Owner JV in the event of an inability or refusal by Hersha Owner
to convey the Property and, more particularly, that Owner JV shall not be
entitled to bring any claim or action against Hersha Owner for damages (except
for a refusal to pay to Hersha JV the liquidated damages provided for in this
Section 9.3). Upon any termination as provided for in clause (i) above, the
Parties shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder, other than
those that by their terms survive the termination of this Agreement. EXCEPT
AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9.3, IN NO EVENT SHALL HERSHA OWNER'S, HERSHA
LESSEE'S, OR ANY OF THE HERSHA MEMBERS' DIRECT OR INDIRECT PARTNERS,
SHAREHOLDERS, OWNERS OR AFFILIATES, ANY OFFICER, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE OR AGENT
OF THE FOREGOING, OR ANY AFFILIATE OR CONTROLLING PERSON THEREOF, HAVE ANY
LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PROPERTY, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, COMMON
LAW, STATUTE, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. The provisions of this Section 9.3 shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.

right to assign, transfer, convey and/or otherwise sell (or enter into any
agreement to do the same), directly or indirectly, any interest it may have in
or under this Agreement without first having obtained the written consent of
Hersha Owner and Hersha Lessee, which consent may be withheld in Hersha
Owner's and Hersha Lessee's sole and absolute discretion, provided, however,
Owner JV and Lessee JV shall have the right, without obtaining Seller's
consent as aforesaid, to designate a wholly-owned subsidiary of Owner JV as
the nominee of Owner JV to receive title to the Property and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Lessee JV to enter into the New Management Agreement, the New

effective until Owner JV and Lessee JV has provided Hersha Owner and Lessee
Owner with a fully executed copy of such designation or assignment and
assumption instrument, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Hersha
Owner and Hersha Lessee. Except in connection with the rights of Hersha Owner
under Section 10.19 of this Agreement, Hersha Owner shall not have the right
to assign, transfer, convey and/or otherwise sell (or enter into any agreement
to do the same), directly or indirectly, any interest it may have in or under
this Agreement without first having obtained the written consent of Owner JV,
which consent may be withheld in Owner JV's sole and absolute discretion.

set forth in this Agreement including but not limited to each of the dates and
time periods provided for in this Agreement.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 10.19 \t\t\t1031 Exchange. Owner JV acknowledges that Hersha
Owner may elect to effect an exchange (the "Exchange") of the Property for
property of like-kind and qualifying use (the "Exchange Property") pursuant to
Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, Owner JV agrees that Owner JV shall, at no cost to Owner JV,
cooperate with Hersha Owner in effecting such Exchange, Hersha Owner may
effect a deferred "tax-free exchange" under Section 1031 of the Federal
Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, including,
without limitation, through the use of a "qualified intermediary" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1031 (k)-1(g)(4) (hereafter a
"Qualified Intermediary"), as shall be selected by Hersha Owner. Owner JV
shall take such steps and execute such documents, including, without
limitation, the QI Assignment (as hereinafter defined), as may be reasonably
necessary to assist Hersha Owner in this regard. If Hersha Owner assigns its
interest in this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary (the "QI Assignment")
as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) on or before the
Closing Date, then Owner JV, upon written notice from Hersha Owner, shall pay
the Property Sale Proceeds to such Qualified Intermediary. The obligations of
Owner JV pursuant to this Section 10.19 shall survive the Closing. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 10.20 \t\t\tDispute Resolution. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the following procedures shall be used exclusively by the
Parties to resolve any dispute under this Agreement ("Dispute"): 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tA meeting shall be held between the Parties within ten
(10) days after any Party gives written notice of the Dispute to the other
Party (the "Dispute Notice"), which meeting shall be attended by a
representative of each Party having decision-making authority regarding the
Dispute (subject to board of directors or equivalent approval, if required) to
attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the Dispute. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tIf, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Dispute Notice, the Parties have not succeeded in negotiating a written
resolution of the Dispute, upon written request by any Party to the other
Party, all Parties will promptly negotiate in good faith to jointly appoint a
mutually acceptable neutral person not affiliated with any other parties (the
"Neutral"). The Parties shall seek assistance in connection with the
appointment of the Neutral from the American Arbitration Association or the
Center for Public Resources, if they have been unable to agree upon the
appointment of a Neutral within ten (10) days after one Party requests the
appointment of a Neutral. The fees and cost of the Neutral and of any such
assistance shall be shared equally between the Parties. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t47  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tThe Neutral appointed shall have a background in the
management and operation of hotel facilities or commercial real estate
projects, and the Neutral appointed may be rejected by the Parties only for
reasons of bias. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tThe Neutral shall have forty-five (45) days from the
time of his or her appointment to meet with the parties and help them resolve
the Dispute, unless the Parties mutually consent to an extension of this
deadline. The cost of this negotiating session, including fees and expenses,
shall be borne equally by the Parties. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tThe Parties agree to participate in good faith in a
negotiating session(s) with the Neutral; provided, however, no Party shall be
obligated to continue to participate in the negotiation session after such
forty-fifth (45th) day. If the Parties have not resolved the Dispute in
writing within sixty (60) days after the appointment of the Neutral, either
Party may elect to terminate the negotiations in writing following the
expiration of such sixty (60)-day period and pursue legal action in any New
York Court as further set forth in Section 10.11. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe provisions of this Section 10.20 shall survive the Closing and any
termination of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 10.21 \t\t\tNo Joint and Several Liability. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Hersha Owner and the Other Sellers shall not
be jointly liable under this Agreement and the Other APCAs, but rather (i)
Hersha Owner shall only be liable for representations, warranties, covenants
and other obligations directly relating to Hersha Owner and the Property as
provided in this Agreement and (ii) each of the Other Sellers shall only be
liable for representations, warranties, covenants and other obligations
directly relating to such Other Seller and the applicable Other Property as
provided in the applicable Other APCA. By approving the transactions
contemplated hereby, no shareholder, member, partner, director, manager or
officer of Hersha Owner or any of the Other Sellers shall have any personal
liability hereunder for any obligations of Hersha Owner under this Agreement
or for any obligations of any of the Other Seller under the Other APCAs.
