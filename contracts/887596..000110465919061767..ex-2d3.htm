 \t\t\tPurchase and Sale of Membership Interests; Closing \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.01 Purchase and Sale of the Membership Interests. On
the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Closing, each Seller
shall sell, convey, transfer and assign to Purchaser, free and clear of any
Liens (other than restrictions imposed on transfer under applicable federal
and/or state securities laws or regulations), and Purchaser shall purchase and
acquire at the Closing from each Seller, all right, title and interest in and

(b) in the case of Group A Sellers, the Contingent Consideration (if any)
payable pursuant to Section 1.06, plus (c) in the case of Group A Sellers,
the Brand Sale Consideration (if any) payable pursuant to Section 1.07. The

conditions set forth in Article VI (or the waiver thereof by the party
entitled to waive that condition), the closing of the Transactions (the

are agreed to in writing by the Parties. If the Closing occurs on the same
date as the closing date under the North Italia Option Exercise Agreement,
then the Closing shall be deemed to occur immediately after the closing under
the North Italia Option Exercise Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.03 Transactions To Be Effected at the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) At the Closing, all of the existing and outstanding Funded
Indebtedness shall be repaid in full in accordance with Section
1.03(c)(i). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, Sellers and the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
Purchaser all of the documents required to be delivered by them pursuant to
Article VI. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) At the Closing, Purchaser shall make the following
payments to the following recipients: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) on behalf of the Company, payment of the amount of the
Funded Indebtedness by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts of the applicable payees thereof designated in the Payoff
Letters; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) on behalf of Sellers or the Company, as applicable,
payment of the Seller Transaction Expenses required to be paid at or around
Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts of the applicable payees thereof, as designated in the Closing
Consideration Certificate (it being understood that Sellers' Representative
may elect for a portion of the Seller Transaction Expenses to be deposited in
an account under its control for further disbursement by Sellers'
Representative); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) payment of the Group B Sellers Closing Payment by wire
transfer of immediately available funds for deposit into the account
designated by Sellers' Representative (subject to Section 1.03(d), to be
distributed to Group B Sellers in accordance with their Group B Pro Rata
Shares); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) payment of the Group A Sellers Closing Payment by wire
transfer or immediately available funds for deposit into the account

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(v) payment of the Minority Reorganization Payment by wire
transfer of immediately available funds for deposit into the accounts
designated by the Company for the account of the Minority Subsidiary
Investors. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein
(including any requirement that any amount shall be paid in accordance with
the Pro Rata Shares of Sellers), Sellers' Representative may adjust any
payment to be distributed to Sellers at Closing in accordance with this
Agreement to allocate (i) the Group A Sellers Closing Payment and the Group B
Sellers Closing Payment among Sellers in a manner that compensates Sellers
that did not receive any distributions made by the Company on a non-pro rata
basis prior to the Closing Date under the Organizational Documents of the
Company, including Sections 4.1(b)(i) and 4.1(b)(ii) of the Company Operating
Agreement, for the distribution such Sellers would have received had they been
made on a pro rata basis under the Company Operating Agreement, (ii)
responsibility for any of the Seller Transaction Expenses, and (iii) the
economic \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\timpact of the Closing Bonuses and the Closing Bonus Taxes, in any
manner Sellers' Representative may determine in its sole discretion (it being
understood by Sellers that any such expenses may be allocated among Sellers in
a disproportionate manner). Any allocation of the Group A Sellers Closing
Payment, the Group B Sellers Closing Payment, the Seller Transaction Expenses,
the Closing Bonuses and the Closing Bonus Taxes, in accordance with this
Section 1.03(d) shall be reflected in the Closing Consideration Certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 1.05. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Sellers'
Representative all of the documents required to be delivered by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 6.03. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Each Seller hereby agrees to the allocation of the Closing
Cash Consideration, the Adjustment Amount (if any), the Deferred Payment
Holdback Amount, the Contingent Consideration (if any) and the Brand Sale
Consideration (if any) contemplated in this Agreement (including in the
Closing Consideration Certificate), and each Seller forever waives and
relinquishes any and all rights to have the Closing Cash Consideration, the
Adjustment Amount (if any), the Deferred Payment Holdback Amount, the
Contingent Consideration (if any), and the Brand Sale Consideration (if any)
allocated or calculated in any other manner, whether pursuant to any provision
of the Company Operating Agreement or any other Contract with, or for the
benefit of, such Seller. Purchaser and the Company shall be entitled to rely
solely on Exhibit A and the Closing Consideration Certificate with respect to
the amounts allocated and payable to Sellers or the other payees set forth
thereon. Neither Purchaser nor the Company shall be liable for any damages to
any Person, including any Seller, for any inaccuracy, error or omission in
Exhibit A or the Closing Consideration Certificate, or any action taken in
reliance thereon. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.04 Deferred Payment Holdback Amount. Subject to
Section 1.06(e), on each of the first, second, third and fourth year
anniversaries of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay 25% of the Deferred
Payment Holdback Amount, minus the amount of any Seller Transaction Expenses
payable in connection therewith, to Sellers' Representative (to be distributed
to Group A Sellers in accordance with their Group A Pro Rata Shares) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds for deposit into the account
designated by Sellers' Representative. For a period of three years after the
Closing, the Indemnity Holdback Amount may be used by Purchaser to offset
against Sellers' indemnification obligations under Article VIII and Article
IX, and the other portion of the Deferred Payment Holdback Amount may be used
by Purchaser to offset against Sellers' payment obligations under Section
1.05(g). On the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the Indemnity Holdback
Amount less any outstanding and unresolved Claim Amounts, shall no longer be
available to Purchaser to support Group A Sellers' indemnification obligations
under Article VIII and Article IX, and shall be treated and released in the
same manner as the rest of the Deferred Payment Holdback Amount (it being
understand that if such Deferred Payment Holdback Amount has been paid to
Sellers' Representative (to be distributed to Group A Sellers in accordance
with their Group A Pro Rata Shares) in accordance with Section 1.06(e), such
portion of the Indemnity Holdback Amount shall be released to Sellers'
Representative (to be distributed to Group A Sellers in accordance with their
Group A Pro Rata Shares) within five Business Days of such third anniversary).
The portion of the Indemnity Holdback Amount equal to such Claim Amount shall
be withheld by Purchaser and disbursed in accordance with Section
9.05(e). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.05 Closing Cash Consideration; Purchase Price
Adjustment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Not less than five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Sellers' Representative shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
Purchaser a certificate duly executed by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company (the "Closing Consideration Certificate"), containing the following
information (which shall be set forth on an accompanying spreadsheet): \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) an estimate, prepared in good faith by the Company (and
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser) of (A) the Closing Cash Consideration,
(B) the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date (the "Estimated Indebtedness"), (C) the aggregate amount of all Seller
Transaction Expenses that will have not been paid by the Company or its
Subsidiaries as of 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Seller Transaction Expenses
payable on or after the Closing Date) (the "Estimated Seller Transaction
Expenses"), in each case, together with reasonable supporting calculations for
each component thereof and supporting documentation therefor. For purposes
hereof, the "Closing Cash Consideration" means an amount equal to (1)
$220,000,000, minus (2) the Estimated Indebtedness, minus (3) the Estimated
Seller Transaction Expenses, minus (4) the Minority Reorganization Payment,
plus (5) $3,000,000 (representing the amount of loans extended by Guarantor or
its Subsidiaries to the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof
that will, at the election of Purchaser, be forgiven or remain outstanding
after the Closing), plus (6) the amount outstanding under the Company Line of
Credit, to the extent such amounts do not exceed the amount of cash in the
bank accounts of the Company and its Subsidiaries as demonstrated with
reasonable supporting information provided to Purchaser, in each case, as of
11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, minus (7) the
aggregate amount of Closing Bonuses and Closing Bonus Taxes; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) the Group B Sellers Closing Payment (and the portion
thereof payable to each Group B Seller) and the Group A Sellers Closing
Payment (and the portion thereof payable to each Group A Seller); and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) with respect to each Seller: (A) the gross amount of the
Purchase Price that such Seller is entitled to receive at the Closing in
exchange for the Membership Interests held by such Seller as reflected in
Section 1.05(a)(ii) above; and (B) if applicable, the total amount of Taxes to
be withheld from the consideration that such Seller is entitled to
receive. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to Sellers' Representative a statement (the "Statement")
setting forth: (i) the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date (the "Closing Indebtedness"), and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Seller
Transaction Expenses that were not paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries as
of 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Closing
Seller Transaction Expenses"), in each case, together with reasonable
supporting calculations for each component thereof and supporting
documentation therefor. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) During the 30-day period following Sellers'
Representative's receipt of the Statement, Sellers' Representative and its
auditors and Representatives shall be permitted to review the working papers
of the Company, Purchaser and their respective accountants relating to the
Statement, together with all other reasonably requested materials relating to
the Statement, including any materials prepared by Purchaser and/or its
accountants; provided, that Sellers' Representative and its auditors and
Representatives shall have executed all release letters (if any) reasonably
requested by Purchaser's and the Company's accountants in connection
therewith. The Statement and the calculations of the Closing Indebtedness and
the Closing Seller Transaction Expenses (collectively, the "Closing
Calculations") shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the 30th day
following delivery thereof, unless Sellers' Representative delivers written
notice of its disagreement with the Statement and the Closing Calculations (a
"Notice of Disagreement") to Purchaser before such date. Any Notice of
Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the specific amount(s)
disputed, Sellers' Representative's rationale for such dispute(s) and its
proposed calculation for such disputed amount(s), and shall be accompanied by
reasonably supporting documentation therefor, and (ii) only include
disagreements (x) based on mathematical errors, or (y) based on the Closing
Calculations not being calculated in accordance with this Agreement,
including \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tany definitions in this Agreement used in such Closing Calculations.
If a Notice of Disagreement is delivered to Purchaser in a timely manner, then
the Statement and the Closing Calculations (as revised in accordance with this
sentence) shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the earlier of
(A) the date Sellers' Representative and Purchaser resolve in writing any
differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement (and the Statement and the Closing Calculations shall be final
and binding to the extent any such matters are so resolved) or (B) the date
any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm
(and the Statement and the Closing Calculations shall be final and binding to
the extent any such matters are so resolved). Any items set forth in the
Statement and the Closing Calculations that are not disputed in a Notice of
Disagreement timely delivered in accordance with this Section 1.05(c) shall be
deemed final and binding upon the Parties as set forth in the Statement.
During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement,
Sellers' Representative and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement; provided, that, the Parties agree
that each of the Closing Calculations shall not be outside the range
established by the amounts, or the relative positions taken, by Purchaser, on
the one hand, as set forth in the Statement with respect to such items, and by
Sellers' Representative, on the other hand, as set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement with respect to such items. During such period Purchaser and its
auditors and Representatives shall have access to the working papers of
Sellers' Representative and Sellers' Representative's accountants prepared in
connection with the Notice of Disagreement, together with all other reasonably
requested materials relating to the Notice of Disagreement; provided, that
Purchaser and its auditors and Representatives shall have executed all release
letters (if any) reasonably requested by Sellers' Representative's accountants
in connection therewith. Neither Purchaser nor Sellers' Representative may
change its calculations from the amounts proposed in the Statement (with
respect to Purchaser) and the Notice of Disagreement (with respect to Sellers'
Representative) without the other Party's consent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) At the end of such 30-day period, to the extent Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute set forth in
the Notice of Disagreement, Sellers' Representative and Purchaser shall
jointly submit any such remaining disputes (the "Disputed Items") to the
Accounting Firm. Purchaser and Sellers' Representative shall instruct the
Accounting Firm to resolve, in accordance with this Agreement, only the
Disputed Items. Within 30 days after retaining the Accounting Firm, each of
Sellers' Representative and Purchaser shall deliver to the other Party and the
Accounting Firm a report setting forth such party's determination and
calculation of the Disputed Items; provided, that the Accounting Firm shall
engage in no other ex parte communication with Sellers' Representative or
Purchaser (or any of their respective Representatives) without the consent of
both Sellers' Representative and Purchaser. No Party will disclose to the
Accounting Firm, and the Accounting Firm will not consider for any purpose,
any settlement discussions or settlement offer made by any Party, unless
otherwise agreed to by Sellers' Representative and Purchaser. Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser shall jointly request that the Accounting Firm
render a decision resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm as
soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days after such submission.
To the extent Sellers' Representative and Purchaser are unable to mutually
agree on any procedure by which the Accounting Firm considers and resolves the
Disputed Items within 10 Business Days of the engagement of the Accounting
Firm, the Accounting Firm will determine the appropriate procedures. Any
determination made by the Accounting Firm shall not be outside the range
established by the amounts, or the relative positions taken, by Purchaser, on
the one hand, as set forth in the Statement, and by Sellers' Representative,
on the other hand, as set forth in the Notice of Disagreement. The Accounting
Firm shall set forth its determination of all Disputed Items (as well as the
Adjustment Amount) in a written report, which report shall include a worksheet
setting forth the material calculations used in arriving at such determination
and a calculation of the apportionment of the fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm in accordance with Section 1.05(e). The Parties acknowledge
and agree that, if any such dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm
pursuant to this Section 1.05, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Seller
Transaction Expenses, as determined by the \t\t

 \t\t\tAccounting Firm, shall constitute Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Seller Transaction Expenses, and be final, binding, and conclusive on the
Parties for purposes of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) If requested by the Accounting Firm, Purchaser and
Sellers' Representative agree to execute a reasonable engagement letter. The
cost of any review by the Accounting Firm (including the fees and expenses,
including any retainer, of the Accounting Firm and reasonable attorney fees
and expenses of the Parties) pursuant to this Section 1.05 shall be borne by
Purchaser and Sellers' Representative in inverse proportion as they may
prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate
allocations shall also be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time its
determination is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. However,
initially, any retainer charged by the Accounting Firm shall be paid 50% by
Purchaser and 50% by Sellers' Representative, with such amount to be
reimbursed by the Party responsible for paying the cost of the review in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. All other fees and
expenses incurred by Purchaser or Sellers' Representative in connection with
the preparation, review or certification of the Statement or the Notice of
Disagreement shall be borne by the Party incurring such fees and expenses. A
court of competent jurisdiction shall be permitted to enforce the
determination of an Accounting Firm, as the case may be, pursuant to this
Section 1.05. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Adjustments. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) If Closing Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 1.05 is less than Estimated Indebtedness, Purchaser shall pay to
Sellers' Representative (to be distributed to Group A Sellers in accordance
with their Group A Pro Rata Shares) such shortfall in accordance with Section
1.05(g). If Closing Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.05 is greater than Estimated Indebtedness, such excess shall be paid
to Purchaser in accordance with Section 1.05(g). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) If Closing Seller Transaction Expenses as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 1.05 is less than Estimated Seller
Transaction Expenses, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers' Representative (to be
distributed to Group A Sellers in accordance with their Group A Pro Rata
Shares) such shortfall in accordance with Section 1.05(g). If Closing Seller
Transaction Expenses as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.05 is
greater than Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses, such excess shall be paid
to Purchaser in accordance with Section 1.05(g). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Without duplication, the amounts owed pursuant to Section
1.05(f)(i) and Section 1.05(f)(ii) shall be aggregated, and the net amount (if
any) payable by Purchaser to Sellers' Representative (to be distributed to
Group A Sellers in accordance with their Group A Pro Rata Shares), on the one
hand, or payable by Group A Sellers to Purchaser, on the other hand, is
referred to as the "Adjustment Amount"; it being understood and agreed that
(i) if the Adjustment Amount is payable by Purchaser to Group A Sellers, then
Purchaser shall, within five Business Days after the Statement becomes final
and binding on the Parties in accordance with this Section 1.05, pay by wire
transfer of immediately available funds the Adjustment Amount to Sellers'
Representative (to be distributed to Group A Sellers in accordance with their
Group A Pro Rata Shares), and (ii) if the Adjustment Amount is payable to
Purchaser, Purchaser shall receive the Adjustment Amount through setting off
the Adjustment Amount against the portion of the Deferred Payment Holdback
Amount that is not the Indemnity Holdback Amount (and withholding and
retaining such amount for its own account). The Closing Cash Consideration,
as increased or decreased by the Adjustment Amount, is referred to herein as
the "Adjusted Closing Cash Consideration." \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Contingent Consideration Statement. Within 60 days after
the end of the Measurement Period, Purchaser shall prepare in good faith and
deliver to Sellers' Representative an unaudited statement of Aggregate TTM
Sales and the Aggregate TTM 4-Wall Margin for the Measurement Period (the
"Contingent Consideration Statement"). The Contingent Consideration Statement
also shall be accompanied by a calculation of the Contingent Consideration
Amount, if any, payable with respect to the Measurement Period. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Dispute Resolution. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) During the 30-day period following Sellers'
Representative's receipt of the Contingent Consideration Statement, Sellers'
Representative and its auditors and Representatives shall be permitted to
review the working papers of Purchaser and its accountants relating to the
Contingent Consideration Statement and the calculation of the Aggregate TTM
Sales, Aggregate TTM 4-Wall Margin, together with all other reasonably
requested materials relating thereto (the "Contingent Consideration
Calculations"); provided, that Sellers' Representative and its auditors and
Representatives shall have executed all release letters (if any) reasonably
requested by Purchaser's and the Company's accountants in connection
therewith. The Contingent Consideration Statement and the Contingent
Consideration Calculations shall become final and binding upon the Parties
hereto on the 30th day following delivery thereof, unless Sellers'
Representative delivers written notice of its disagreement with the Contingent
Consideration Calculations before such date. Any such notice of disagreement
shall (X) specify in reasonable detail the specific amount(s) disputed,
Sellers' Representative's rationale for such dispute(s) and its proposed
calculation for such disputed amount(s), and shall be accompanied by
reasonable supporting documentation therefor, and (Y) only include
disagreements (x) based on mathematical errors, or (y) based on the Contingent
Consideration Calculations not being calculated in accordance with this
Agreement, including any definitions in this Agreement used in such Contingent
Consideration Calculations (the "Contingent Consideration Objection Notice").
If a Contingent Consideration Objection Notice is delivered to Purchaser in a
timely manner, then the Contingent Consideration Calculations (as revised in
accordance with this sentence) shall become final and binding upon the Parties
hereto on the earlier of (A) the date Sellers' Representative and Purchaser
resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters
specified in the Contingent Consideration Objection Notice (and the Contingent
Consideration Statement and the Contingent Consideration Calculations shall be
final and binding to the extent any such matters are so resolved) or (B) the
date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting
Firm (and the Contingent Consideration Statement and the Contingent
Consideration Calculations shall be final and binding to the extent any such
matters are so resolved). Any items set forth in the Contingent Consideration
Statement and the Contingent Consideration Calculations that are not disputed
in a Contingent Consideration Objection Notice timely delivered in accordance
with this Section 1.06(b) shall be deemed final and binding upon the Parties
hereto as set forth in the Contingent Consideration Statement and the
Contingent Consideration Calculations. During the 30-day period following the
delivery of a Contingent Consideration Objection Notice, Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing
any differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in
the Contingent Consideration Objection Notice; provided, that the Parties
hereto agree that each item of the Contingent Consideration Statement and
Contingent Consideration Calculations shall not be outside the range
established by the amounts, or the relative positions taken, by Purchaser, on
the one hand, as set forth in the Contingent Consideration Statement and
Contingent Consideration Calculations with respect to such items, and by
Sellers' Representative, on the other hand, as set forth in the Contingent
Consideration Objection Notice with respect to such items. During such period
Purchaser and its auditors and Representatives shall have access to the
working papers of Sellers' Representative and Sellers' Representative's
accountants prepared in connection with the Contingent Consideration \t\t

Neither Purchaser nor Sellers' Representative may change its calculations from
the amounts proposed in the Contingent Consideration Statement and Contingent
Consideration Calculations (with respect to Purchaser) and the Contingent
Consideration Objection Notice (with respect Sellers' Representative) without
the other's consent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) At the end of such 30-day period, to the extent Purchaser
and Sellers' Representative are unable to resolve any dispute set forth in the
Contingent Consideration Objection Notice, Purchaser and Sellers'
Representative shall jointly submit any such remaining disputes (the "Disputed
Contingent Consideration Items") to the Accounting Firm. Purchaser and
Sellers' Representative shall instruct the Accounting Firm to resolve, in
accordance with this Agreement, only the Disputed Contingent Consideration
Items. Within 30 days after retaining the Accounting Firm, each of Purchaser
and Sellers' Representative shall deliver to the other and the Accounting Firm
a report setting forth such party's determination and calculation of the
Disputed Contingent Consideration Items; provided, that the Accounting Firm
shall engage in no other ex parte communication with Purchaser or Sellers'
Representative (or any of their respective Representatives) without the
consent of both Purchaser and Sellers' Representative. No party will disclose
to the Accounting Firm, and the Accounting Firm will not consider for any
purpose, any settlement discussions or settlement offer made by any party,
unless otherwise agreed to by Purchaser and Sellers' Representative.
Purchaser and Sellers' Representative shall jointly request that the
Accounting Firm render a decision resolving the matters submitted to the
Accounting Firm as soon as practicable thereafter, but in no event later than
30 days after such submission. To the extent Purchaser and Sellers'
Representative are unable to mutually agree on any procedure by which the
Accounting Firm considers and resolves the Disputed Contingent Consideration
Items within 10 Business Days of the engagement of the Accounting Firm, the
Accounting Firm will determine the appropriate procedures. Any determination
made by the Accounting Firm shall not be outside the range established by the
amounts, or the relative positions taken, by Purchaser, on the one hand, as
set forth in the Contingent Consideration Statement and Contingent
Consideration Calculations, and by Sellers' Representative, on the other hand,
as set forth in the Contingent Consideration Objection Notice. The Accounting
Firm shall set forth its determination of all Disputed Contingent
Consideration Items in a written report, which report shall include a
worksheet setting forth the material calculations used in arriving at such
determination and a calculation of the apportionment of the fees, costs and
expenses of the Accounting Firm in accordance with Section 1.06(b)(iii). The
Parties acknowledge and agree that, if any such dispute is submitted to the
Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 1.06(b), the Aggregate TTM Sales,
Aggregate TTM 4-Wall Margin and Contingent Consideration Calculations, as
determined by the Accounting Firm, shall constitute the Aggregate TTM Sales,
Aggregate TTM 4-Wall Margin and Contingent Consideration Calculations and be
final, binding, and conclusive on the Parties for purposes of this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) If requested by the Accounting Firm, Purchaser and
Sellers' Representative agree to execute a reasonable engagement letter. The
cost of any review by the Accounting Firm (including the fees and expenses,
including any retainer, of the Accounting Firm and reasonable attorney fees
and expenses of the Parties) pursuant to this Section 1.06(b) shall be borne
by Purchaser and Sellers' Representative in inverse proportion as they may
prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate
allocations shall also be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time its
determination is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. However,
initially, any retainer charged by the Accounting Firm shall be paid 50% by
Purchaser and 50% by Sellers' Representative, with such amount to be
reimbursed by the Party responsible \t\t

shall be borne by the Party incurring such fees and expenses. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Calculation of Contingent Consideration Amount; Payment of
Contingent Consideration Amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Following the Closing, the Contingent Consideration will
be paid and calculated in accordance with Exhibit C. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made pursuant to
or in connection with this Section 1.06 shall be deemed to be an adjustment to
the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) The Contingent Consideration payable hereunder reflects
the difficulty in valuing the Membership Interests, is intended to be part of
the total purchase price hereunder to Group A Sellers in exchange for their
Membership Interests, is not intended to be compensatory in nature and the
payment thereof is not dependent upon the continued employment or services of
any Person or individual. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Purchaser Discretion. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Sellers understand and acknowledge that (A) except as
provided in Exhibit G, Guarantor may operate its business and the business of
its Affiliates (including the Company after the Closing) in the manner it
deems appropriate in its sole discretion and (B) there are no implied duties
under applicable Law or otherwise with respect to this Section 1.06. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after Closing,
none of Guarantor or Purchaser shall take any actions in bad faith with the
specific purpose of avoiding or reducing the amount of Contingent
Consideration payable hereunder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Termination Option. In the event of a Guarantor Change of
Control, Purchaser shall deliver written notice thereof to Sellers'
Representative no later than 30 days prior to the closing of such Guarantor
Change of Control. Within 15 days after Sellers' Representative receives such
written notice, Sellers' Representative or Purchaser may irrevocably elect by
written notice delivered to the other party to require Purchaser, at the
closing of such Guarantor Change of Control, to pay Sellers' Representative
(to be distributed to Group A Sellers in accordance with their Group A Pro
Rata Shares) (i) the remaining amount of the Deferred Payment Holdback Amount
(other than the Indemnity Holdback Amount) and (ii) if no Contingent
Consideration has been paid pursuant to Section 1.06 prior to the closing of
such Guarantor Change of Control, an amount equal to [****], the "Termination
Amount"); provided, however, that if either Sellers' Representative or
Purchaser makes such written election, the payment of the Termination Amount
shall be conditioned upon the closing of such Guarantor Change of Control.
Upon payment of the Termination Amount, Purchaser shall not have any further
obligation to pay the Deferred Payment Holdback Amount (other than the
Indemnity Holdback Amount) or Contingent Consideration under this Agreement or
otherwise (it being understood that the Indemnity Holdback Amount shall
continue to be paid in accordance with Section 1.04). \t\t  \t\t\t[****]=[CONFIDENTIAL PORTION HAS BEEN OMITTED BECAUSE IT (I) IS NOT

 \t\t\tSection 1.07 Brand Sale Consideration. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Brand Sale Consideration Statement. Within 30 days after
the consummation of any Brand Sale pursuant to a definitive purchase agreement
entered into by Purchaser or its Affiliates (a "Brand Sale Agreement") at any
time after the Closing and prior to the end of the Measurement Period,
Purchaser shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Sellers' Representative
an unaudited statement of Brand Sale Net Proceeds payable at the closing and
anytime thereafter under the Brand Sale Agreement (the "Brand Sale
Consideration Statement"). The Brand Sale Consideration Statement also shall
be accompanied by a calculation of the Brand Sale Consideration payable with
respect to the Brand Sale (the "Brand Sale Consideration Calculations"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Dispute Resolution. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) During the 30-day period following Sellers'
Representative's receipt of the Brand Sale Consideration Statement, Sellers'
Representative and its auditors and Representatives shall be permitted to
review the working papers of Purchaser and its accountants relating to the
Brand Sale Consideration Statement and the calculation of the relevant Brand
Sale Net Proceeds and Brand Sale Consideration, together with all other
reasonably requested materials relating thereto; provided, that Sellers'
Representative and its auditors and Representatives shall have executed all
release letters (if any) reasonably requested by Purchaser's and the Company's
accountants in connection therewith. The Brand Sale Consideration Statement
and the Brand Sale Consideration Calculations shall become final and binding
upon the Parties hereto on the 30th day following delivery thereof, unless
Sellers' Representative delivers written notice of its disagreement with the
Brand Sale Consideration Calculations before such date. Any such notice of
disagreement shall (X) specify in reasonable detail the specific amount(s)
disputed, Sellers' Representative's rationale for such dispute(s) and its
proposed calculation for such disputed amount(s), and shall be accompanied by
reasonable supporting documentation therefor, and (Y) only include
disagreements (x) based on mathematical errors, or (y) based on the Brand Sale
Consideration Calculations not being calculated in accordance with this
Agreement, including any definitions in this Agreement used in such Brand Sale
Consideration calculations (the "Brand Sale Consideration Objection Notice").
If a Brand Sale Consideration Objection Notice is delivered to Purchaser in a
timely manner, then the Brand Sale Consideration Calculations (as revised in
accordance with this sentence) shall become final and binding upon the Parties
hereto on the earlier of (A) the date Sellers' Representative and Purchaser
resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters
specified in the Brand Sale Consideration Objection Notice (and the Brand Sale
Consideration Statement and the Brand Sale Consideration Calculations shall be
final and binding to the extent any such matters are so resolved) or (B) the
date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting
Firm (and the Brand Sale Consideration Statement and the Brand Sale

matters are so resolved). Any items set forth in the Brand Sale Consideration
Statement and the Brand Sale Consideration Calculations that are not disputed

in the Brand Sale Consideration Objection Notice with respect to such items.
During such period Purchaser and its auditors and Representatives shall have
access to the working papers of Sellers' Representative and Sellers'
Representative's accountants prepared in connection with the Brand Sale
Consideration Objection Notice, together with all other reasonably requested
materials relating thereto; provided, that Purchaser and its auditors and
Representatives shall have executed all release letters (if any) reasonably
requested by Sellers' Representative's accountants in connection therewith.
Neither Purchaser nor Sellers' Representative may change its calculations from
the amounts proposed in the Brand Sale Consideration Statement and Brand Sale
Consideration Calculations (with respect to Purchaser) and the Brand Sale
Consideration Objection Notice (with respect Sellers' Representative) without
the other's consent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) At the end of such 30-day period, to the extent Purchaser
and Sellers' Representative are unable to resolve any dispute set forth in the
Brand Sale Consideration Objection Notice, Purchaser and Sellers'
Representative shall jointly submit any such remaining disputes (the "Disputed
Brand Sale Consideration Items") to the Accounting Firm. Purchaser and
Sellers' Representative shall instruct the Accounting Firm to resolve, in
accordance with this Agreement, only the Disputed Brand Sale Consideration
Items. Within 30 days after retaining the Accounting Firm, each of Purchaser
and Sellers' Representative shall deliver to the other and the Accounting Firm

Disputed Brand Sale Consideration Items; provided, that the Accounting Firm
shall engage in no other ex parte communication with Purchaser or Sellers'

consent of both Purchaser and Sellers' Representative. No party will disclose
to the Accounting Firm, and the Accounting Firm will not consider for any
purpose, any settlement discussions or settlement offer made by any party,
unless otherwise agreed to by Purchaser and Sellers' Representative.
Purchaser and Sellers' Representative shall jointly request that the
Accounting Firm render a decision resolving the matters submitted to the
Accounting Firm as soon as practicable thereafter, but in no event later than
30 days after such submission. To the extent Purchaser and Sellers'
Representative are unable to mutually agree on any procedure by which the
Accounting Firm considers and resolves the Disputed Brand Sale Consideration
Items within 10 Business Days of the engagement of the Accounting Firm, the
Accounting Firm will determine the appropriate procedures. Any determination
made by the Accounting Firm shall not be outside the range established by the
amounts, or the relative positions taken, by Purchaser, on the one hand, as
set forth in the Brand Sale Consideration Statement and Brand Sale
Consideration Calculations, and by Sellers' Representative, on the other hand,
as set forth in the Brand Sale Consideration Objection Notice. The Accounting
Firm shall set forth its determination of all Disputed Brand Sale
Consideration Items in a written report, which report shall include a

responsible for paying the cost of the review in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence. All other fees and expenses incurred by

Notice shall be borne by the Party incurring such fees and expenses. \t\t

Sale Consideration. \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Following the consummation of a Brand Sale pursuant to a
Brand Sale Agreement, and after the relevant Brand Sale Consideration
Calculations and the Brand Sale Consideration Statement have become final and
binding upon the Parties in accordance with Section 1.07(b), Purchaser shall
then within five Business Days following such final determination, pay the
following to Sellers' Representative (to be distributed to Group A Sellers in
accordance with their Group A Pro Rata Shares) (the "Brand Sale
Consideration"): \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(A) if after the Closing Date and before the end of the
Measurement Period, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates enters into the
applicable Brand Sale Agreement (other than a Brand Sale of the Zinburger or
Blanco brands), then the Brand Sale Consideration with respect to such sale
shall be an amount equal to [****]% of the Brand Sale Net Proceeds; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(B) if after the Closing Date and before the second anniversary
of the Closing Date, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates enters into the
applicable Brand Sale Agreement for a Brand Sale of the Zinburger or Blanco
brands, then the Brand Sale Consideration with respect to such sale shall be
an amount equal to [****]% of the Brand Sale Net Proceeds; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(C) if on or after the second anniversary of the Closing Date
and before the end of the Measurement Period, Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates enters into the applicable Brand Sale Agreement for a Brand Sale of
the Zinburger or Blanco brands, then the Brand Sale Consideration with respect
to such sale shall be an amount equal to [****]% of the Brand Sale Net
Proceeds. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) In the event that Purchaser or its Affiliates are
required to pay Brand Sale Consideration to Sellers' Representative under
clause (A), (B) or (C) above and, after the closing of the applicable Brand
Sale, Purchaser or its Affiliates actually receive additional Brand Sale
Consideration (i.e., as a result of the payment of deferred consideration or
contingent consideration) pursuant to such Brand Sale, the applicable
percentage of such additional Brand Sale Consideration (as determined in
accordance with such clause) shall be paid to Sellers' Representative (to be
distributed to Group A Sellers in accordance with the Group A Pro Rata
Shares). In the event that any such additional Brand Sale Consideration
received by Purchaser or its Affiliates was not already reflected on the Brand
Sale Consideration Statement delivered pursuant to Section 1.07(b), Purchaser
shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Sellers' Representative an amended
Brand Sale Consideration Statement and amended Brand Sale Consideration
Calculations, and the procedures \t\t  \t\t\t[****]=[CONFIDENTIAL PORTION HAS BEEN OMITTED BECAUSE IT (I) IS NOT

Calculations. After such amended Brand Sale Consideration Calculations and
such amended Brand Sale Consideration Statement have become final and binding
upon the Parties in accordance with Section 1.07(b), Purchaser shall then
within five Business Days following such final determination, pay the
applicable percentage of such additional Brand Sale Consideration to Sellers'
Representative (to be distributed to Group A Sellers in accordance with the
Group A Pro Rata Shares). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made pursuant to
or in connection with this Section 1.07 shall be deemed to be an adjustment to
the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) The Brand Sale Consideration payable hereunder reflects
the difficulty in valuing the Membership Interests, is intended to be part of

their Membership Interests, is not intended to be compensatory in nature and
the payment thereof is not dependent upon the continued employment or services
of any Person or individual. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Brand Sale Consent Right. Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 1.07 to the contrary, Purchaser agrees that it shall not, and it
shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, commit to a Brand Sale before the
second anniversary of the Closing Date without the prior written consent of
Fox (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, that
the prior written consent of Fox shall not be required (i) to the extent the
failure to conduct a Brand Sale would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the board of directors of Guarantor under applicable Law or (ii) if
the employment of Fox with Guarantor has ceased for any reason. \t\t

Company Lease Party is not, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, all other
parties thereto are not, in material breach or material default in any respect
under the terms thereof and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has

material breach or material default or permit termination, modification or
acceleration thereunder; and (iii) the Company Lease Party has not assigned,
transferred, conveyed, mortgaged, or deeded in trust any interest in the
leasehold or sub-leasehold of any Lease; (iv) no landlord under a Lease has

condition and repair, and all other structures, improvements, buildings and
fixtures located on the Company Property and all systems and equipment related

each case, in all material respects, subject to ordinary wear and tear, and
without material defect or deficiency, other than for replacements, repairs
and maintenance covered by the Capital Expenditures Budget (as set forth on
Section 3.08(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule). To the extent that any
one or more of the Leases requires the Company or an RP Subsidiary to perform
maintenance obligations with respect to any of the Company Property, the
Company and the RP Subsidiaries are in material compliance with such
obligations. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Each of the RP Subsidiaries has received all approvals and
authorizations from Governmental Entities (including certificates of occupancy

Knowledge of the Company, is not subject to any pending or threatened
opposition, cancellation, interference or similar proceeding. The Company and
its Subsidiaries have taken all steps reasonably necessary to prosecute and
maintain registrations of all Registered Company Intellectual Property,
including by payment of all filing, registration, examination, renewal,
maintenance and other fees and annuities and the timely filing of all
necessary renewals, statements and certifications to avoid lapse, expiration

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Section 3.09(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) The conduct of the business of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has not and does not, and the Company Intellectual Property and
the development or provision of the Company Products or Services, has not and
does not (i) violate, dilute, infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual

privacy rights, or publicity rights of any other Person or (2) constitutes a

holding, decision, or judgment (except for those office actions issued in the
ordinary course of prosecution) has been rendered in any action before any
Governmental Entity denying the validity of, the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' right to own or use, any Company Intellectual Property. The
Company and its Subsidiaries are not subject to any proceeding or outstanding
decree, order, judgment or stipulation restricting in any manner (a) the use,
transfer or licensing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the Company
Intellectual Property, or (b) the use, manufacture, transfer, sale,

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
agreements related thereto will not result in the loss of the ownership, or
any license of or other right to, any material Intellectual Property used in
the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in a
material breach, alteration, modification, cancellation, termination, non-
renewal, suspension of, or acceleration of any payments of the terms and
conditions related thereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries have reasonably
maintained, policed and protected all material Company Intellectual Property
that derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being
generally known to the public or to other Persons who can obtain economic
value from its disclosure or use, in confidence in accordance with protection
procedures customarily used in the industry to protect rights of like
importance. Since July 1, 2010, all former and current salaried management
and key personnel of the Company, including all current employees, consultants
and independent contractors who have contributed to or participated in the
conception or development of material Company Intellectual Property for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Key Personnel") have
executed and delivered to the Company and its Subsidiaries customary non-
disclosure or confidentiality agreements restricting such Person's right to
disclose proprietary information of the Company. All former and current Key
Personnel since July 1, 2010 have executed instruments of assignment in favor
of the Company or its applicable Subsidiary as assignee in which they have
expressly assigned to the Company or its applicable Subsidiary all of their
rights in and to any material Intellectual Property developed for the Company
or its applicable Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of the Company, no former or
current Key Personnel have any claim against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with such Person's involvement in the conception or
development of any Company Intellectual Property and no such claim has been
asserted or threatened. None of the current officers and employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any Patents issued or applications
pending for any device, process, design or invention of any kind now used or
needed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the furtherance of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which Patents or applications
have not been assigned to the Company or its applicable Subsidiary with such
assignment duly recorded in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. At
no time during the conception of or reduction to practice of any Company
Intellectual Property was any Key Personnel operating under any grants from
any Governmental Entity or educational institution, performing research
sponsored by any Governmental Entity or educational institution, utilizing the
facilities of any Governmental Entity or educational institution or subject to
any employment agreement or invention assignment or nondisclosure agreement or
other obligation with any third Person. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is registered to
use its name as the name of a corporation in any jurisdiction in which it
currently does business. The Company and its Subsidiaries have not received
any written notice of conflict in the last three years with respect to the
rights of others regarding the use of their name. \t\t

Subsidiaries or is the subject of a pending request of a Governmental Entity.
No material assessment, claim or Proceeding is pending, proposed in writing
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax. There are no Liens for Taxes upon any
of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except Liens for

complied in all material respects with all reporting and record retention
requirements related to such Taxes. \t\t

 \t\t

rulings, or closing agreements relating to Taxes that could affect the
Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' liability for Taxes for any taxable

and compliance by Purchaser and Guarantor with the terms hereof and thereof

experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of Purchaser's acquisition of the Membership Interests.
Purchaser confirms that it can bear the economic risk of its investment in the
Membership Interests. Purchaser is acquiring the Membership Interests for
investment and not with a view toward or for sale in connection with any

not enter into any Contracts or consummate any transactions related thereto
without the prior written consent of Purchaser. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Company and each Seller shall, and shall cause its

specific terms and conditions discussed or proposed) and (iii) keep Purchaser
fully informed with respect to the status of the foregoing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.04 Reasonable Efforts. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things
necessary to consummate and make effective, as promptly as commercially
practicable, the Transactions, including using commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals
from Governmental Entities and to make all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Entities, which shall include filing the
premerger notifications and related documentation required under the HSR Act
no later than ten Business Days following the date hereof) and to take all
commercially reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or
waiver from, or to avoid a Proceeding by, any Governmental Entity. Each of
Purchaser and the Company shall pay 50% of the HSR Act filing fees.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not have any obligation to (and
the Company and its Affiliates shall not without Purchaser's prior written
request) (x) propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any
assets or businesses of Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or (y) otherwise take or commit to take any actions that would
limit the freedom of Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or
their Affiliates with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of
their businesses, product lines or assets. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Before the Closing, the Company shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, and to cooperate in obtaining, all Consents from
third parties necessary or appropriate to permit the consummation of the
Transactions; provided, however, that the Parties shall not be required to
pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any
Person from whom any such Consent may be required (other than customary filing
fees payable to Governmental Entities and nominal filing or application fees
payable to other third parties) and no Party shall agree to any conditions or
restrictions imposed by any third party that, individually or in the
aggregate, would materially impair (or could reasonably be expected to
materially impair) the ability of such Party to consummate the Transactions or
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the economic
benefits to Purchaser arising therefrom. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Prior to the Closing, subject to Laws relating to the
sharing of information, each of Purchaser, the Company and Sellers'
Representative shall have the right to review in advance, and to the \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\textent practicable each will consult the others on, any Filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions. Each of the Parties shall furnish
to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any such filing
or submission. Furthermore, the Parties shall (i) keep each other fully
informed of all communications received from, or made to, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information or documents from, the United States
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) not make any submission to a
Governmental Entity related to the transactions contemplated hereby without
first having provided the other party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
to provide comments on such submission, and having considered such comments in
good faith and (iii) promptly and completely provide any information or
documents requested by any Governmental Entity in connection with transactions
contemplated hereby. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.05 Confidentiality. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) On the Closing Date, Guarantor and the Company hereby
agree that the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. From and after the
Closing Date, the terms of Section 5.05(b) shall apply. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Each Seller acknowledges that he, she or it has knowledge
of certain Confidential Information and that such Confidential Information is
confidential and proprietary to the Company and its business and may
constitute valuable Trade Secrets of the Company and its business, which
affect, among other things, the successful conduct, furtherance and protection
of the Company and its business and related goodwill. Each Seller
acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure of such Confidential
Information has the potential to be highly prejudicial to the interests of
Purchaser, the Company and their respective Affiliates or their respective
customers, suppliers, vendors, advertisers, clients and patrons, an invasion
of privacy, or an improper disclosure of Trade Secrets. Each Seller agrees
that a substantial portion of the Purchase Price is being paid for such
Confidential Information and that it represents a substantial investment
having great economic and commercial value to Purchaser and its Affiliates,
and constitutes a substantial part of the value to Purchaser and its
Affiliates of the Company and its business. Each Seller further acknowledges
that Purchaser and its Affiliates and, following the Closing, the Company,
could be irreparably damaged if any of the Confidential Information was
disclosed to, or used or exploited on behalf of, any Person other than
Purchaser and its Affiliates and, following the Closing, the Company.
Accordingly, each Seller covenants and agrees that it shall not, directly or
indirectly, and shall cause any Representatives and any other persons acting
on such Seller's behalf (each Seller and such Representatives and other
persons with respect to such Seller being collectively referred to as the
"Restricted Persons") not to, without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
disclose, use, exploit, furnish or make accessible to anyone or any other
entity, any such Confidential Information, for the benefit of any such
Restricted Person or of any third party, at any time for so long as such
information shall remain secret or confidential or otherwise remain wholly or
partially protectable except that Seller and, prior to the Closing, the
Company may disclose, use or exploit a particular item of Confidential
Information if and to the extent (but only if and to the extent) (i) that such
item is or becomes generally known on a non-confidential basis to persons in
the industry, through no wrongful act of any Restricted Person, in which
Purchaser or the Company is engaged and is part of the public domain or (ii)
required by applicable Law or administrative process; provided, that, prior to
any disclosure under this clause (ii), to the extent reasonably practicable,
such Seller or the Company notifies Purchaser of such disclosure so that
Purchaser may obtain (at its cost) an appropriate protective order or other
protection from such disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, Confidential Information does not include Residuals retained in
the memories of any Seller, which each such Seller may retain and use;
provided, however, that the foregoing does not permit (A) the intentional
memorization of Confidential Information for the purpose of evading
obligations \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.06 Expenses; Transfer Taxes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and the Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring such
expense. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Any real property transfer, transfer, documentary, sales,
use, excise, stock transfer, value-added, stamp, recording, registration and
other similar Taxes, and any conveyance fees or recording charges (including
any penalties and interest and any reasonable costs related to the preparation
and filing of any Tax Returns related to any such Taxes) (such amounts, the
"Transfer Taxes"), imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be borne by Sellers as a Seller Transaction Expense and
(to the extent not included in the determination of Closing Seller Transaction
Expenses) shall be paid by Group A Sellers (in accordance with their Group A
Pro Rata Shares). In addition, Purchaser shall prepare, complete and file all
Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company relating to such Transfer
Taxes, which Tax Returns shall be subject to the approval of Sellers'
Representative, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.07 Employee Matters. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Effective as of the Closing Date and thereafter, for the
purpose of determining eligibility and vesting under Purchaser's and it
Affiliates' plans and programs providing employee benefits to each employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries who continues in employment with Purchaser and
its Affiliates (including the Company) immediately following the closing (the
"Continuing Employees") after the Closing Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall give credit, or shall cause the Company to give credit, to Continuing
Employees for service with the Company, its Subsidiaries and any ERISA
Affiliate prior to the Closing Date, to the same extent as such Continuing
Employee was (or would have been) entitled for such service prior to the
Closing Date, for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any program,
policy or arrangement of Purchaser applicable to such Continuing Employees
following the Closing Date (each a "Purchaser Plan"), except to the extent
prohibited or impeded by Law or where such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits or may be prohibited by the terms of any such program,
policy or arrangement. In addition, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall or
shall cause the Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause
any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or
actively at work requirements under any health or similar plan of the Company,
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser to be waived with respect to Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents, except to the extent that any waiting
period, exclusions or requirements still applied to such Continuing Employee
under the comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Closing, and (ii) fully credit each
Continuing Employee with all deductible payments, co-payments and other out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents under the medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plans
of the Company prior to the Closing during the plan year in which the Closing
occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which such Continuing
Employee has satisfied the deductible, co-payments, or maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for such plan year under any medical, dental, pharmaceutical or
vision benefit plan of the Company, Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser, as
if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such plan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser
and the Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 5.07 are included for the sole benefit of Purchaser and the Company,
and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i)

 \t\t\tto the terms of any applicable individual agreement between such
individual and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall prevent or
restrict in any way the right of the Purchaser to terminate, reassign, promote
or demote any director, manager, officer, employee or independent contractor
of the Company (or to cause any of the foregoing actions) at any time
following the Closing, or to change (or cause the change of) the title,
powers, duties, responsibilities, functions, locations, salaries, other
compensation or terms or conditions of employment or service of any such
employee, consultant, director or manager at any time following the Closing;
(ii) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Plan, (iii)
shall limit the right of Purchaser, the Company or their respective Affiliates
to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Plan or other employee benefit
plan, agreement or other arrangement following the Closing Date, or (iv) shall
confer upon any other Person (including any equityholder, any current or
former director, manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the
Company, or any participant in any Plan or other employee benefit plan,
agreement or other arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof)), any
right to continued or resumed employment, any right to compensation or
benefits, or any third-party beneficiary or other right of any kind or nature
whatsoever. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Not less than five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver a certificate duly executed by the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company ("Closing Bonus Schedule"), which Closing
Bonus Schedule shall set forth (i) the aggregate amount of discretionary
bonuses to be paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries to current or former
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries (the "Closing Bonuses"), (ii) the
employer portion of any employment Taxes that are incurred by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or its Affiliates in connection with the payment of such Closing
Bonuses (the "Closing Bonus Taxes"), and (iii) the name of, and the amount of
Closing Bonus to be received by, each such recipient of a Closing Bonus;
provided, however, that the aggregate amount of such Closing Bonuses and
Closing Bonus Taxes shall not exceed $5,000,000. The Parties acknowledge that
the Purchase Price shall not include an amount equal to the sum of (x) the
Closing Bonuses plus (y) the Closing Bonus Taxes. Promptly after the Closing,
Purchaser shall cause the Company to pay the Closing Bonuses to the Persons
specified in the Closing Bonus Schedule, and Purchaser shall pay the Closing
Bonus Taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.08 Publicity. None of the Parties shall make any
public announcement concerning the Transactions or otherwise reveal publicly
the terms of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements without the
prior written consents of Sellers' Representative and Purchaser in each
instance, except as required by Law (including, if applicable, under
applicable securities laws) or stock exchange requirements (in which case the
disclosing Party shall advise the other Parties and the other Parties shall,
if practicable, have the right to review such press release or announcement
prior to its publication). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.09 Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when
requested by any Party, each Party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other actions, as such other Party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and confirm the
Transactions, including, in the case of Sellers, executing and delivering to
Purchaser such assignments, deeds, bills of sale, consents and other
instruments as Purchaser or its counsel may reasonably request as necessary or
desirable for such purpose. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.10 Treatment of Certain Affiliate Agreements. Except
as set forth on Section 5.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, effective as
of the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall cause all Contracts,
transactions or arrangements between any of their Related Persons, on the one
hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, to be
terminated without any party having any continuing obligations thereunder and,
other than pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or
pursuant to any such Related Person's continued status as an employee of the
Company, there shall be no intercompany obligations between any such Related
Persons, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.11 Drag-Along of Minority Investors. Except with
respect to the Non-Dragged Subsidiaries, on or prior to the third Business Day
immediately after the date hereof, the Company shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, trigger the exercise of drag-along rights under the
Organizational Documents of the Company's non-wholly owned Subsidiaries
pursuant to drag-along notices substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit E (the "Drag-Along Notices"), which shall include the applicable bona
fide offer amounts as mutually agreed by the Company and Purchaser in writing
(the "Bona Fide Offer Amounts"). Purchaser hereby confirms that in connection
with the Transactions, Purchaser agrees to purchase all of the outstanding
Equity Securities of all of the Company's non-wholly owned Subsidiaries, other
than the Non-Dragged Subsidiaries, as necessary to directly or indirectly
acquire all of the Equity Securities held by the holders thereof. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the executed written consent of all holders of Equity
Securities in its Subsidiaries (other than the Company or another of its
Subsidiaries) (such holders, the "Minority Subsidiary Investors") in the form
of Exhibit F (the "Minority Subsidiary Investor Assignments") prior to the
Closing Date. The Company shall keep Purchaser reasonably apprised regarding
the status of its solicitation of Minority Subsidiary Investor Assignments
and, within two Business Days of receipt thereof, shall deliver copies of any
signed Minority Subsidiary Investor Assignments received from the Minority
Subsidiary Investors to Purchaser with the date of execution and name of
assignee in blank. The Company shall promptly notify Purchaser if any
Minority Subsidiary Investor refuses to execute a Minority Subsidiary
Investors Assignment, or otherwise objects to or contests the Drag-Along
Notices or the Transactions. In the event that a Minority Subsidiary Investor
does not execute a Minority Subsidiary Investor Assignment prior to the
Closing, in consultation with the Purchaser, the Company shall, or shall cause
its applicable Subsidiaries to, execute such Minority Subsidiary Investor
Assignment on behalf of such Minority Subsidiary Investor pursuant to any
proxy or power-of-attorney under the Organizational Documents. To the extent
that the Equity Securities held by Minority Subsidiary Investors with respect
to a particular Subsidiary are acquired though Minority Subsidiary Investor
Assignments to the relevant Subsidiary, such transaction shall be deemed to
have taken place immediately following Closing, and the Purchase Price shall
not include the purchase price for the Equity Securities held by the Minority
Subsidiary Investors. To the extent that the Equity Securities held by
Minority Subsidiary Investors with respect to a particular Subsidiary are
acquired though Minority Subsidiary Investor Assignments to Purchaser, such
transaction shall be deemed to have taken place immediately prior to Closing,
and the Purchase Price shall not include the purchase price for all Equity
Securities of the relevant Subsidiary (held by the Company or its Subsidiaries
as well as by the Minority Subsidiary Investors). In the event that Purchaser
directly acquires the Equity Interests of any non-wholly owned Subsidiary
pursuant to the exercise of drag-along rights, Purchaser shall contribute all
Equity Interests in such Subsidiary to the Company or a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company immediately after the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.12 Excluded Assets; Excluded Liabilities. The Company
shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, transfer all of the properties and
assets set forth on Section 5.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule ("Excluded
Assets"), and any Liabilities associated therewith ("Excluded Liabilities") to
a Person other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing Date, such that, following such transfer, neither the Company nor its
Affiliates shall have any continuing Liability with respect to such property
or assets or such transfer. The Company shall provide Purchaser a copy of all
definitive documents concerning such transfer promptly after execution of such
documents. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.13 Governance Matters. From the Closing Date until
the earlier of (a) such time as Fox ceases to be an employee of Guarantor and
(b) the end of the Measurement Period, the Company shall be required to comply
with the governance provisions set forth in Exhibit G and the Amended and
Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Company as of the Closing
(the "AandR LLC Agreement") shall include (or incorporate by reference) such
provisions (the "Exhibit G Provisions"), and in the event of any conflict
between the AandR LLC Agreement and the Exhibit G Provisions, the Exhibit G
Provisions shall control; provided, however, that the Company's obligations

before the Closing: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) by mutual written consent of Sellers' Representative and
Purchaser; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) by Sellers' Representative or Purchaser if the
Transactions shall not have been consummated by November 6, 2019 (the "Outside
Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 7.01(a)(ii) shall not be available to Sellers' Representative (on
behalf of Sellers and the Company) or Purchaser, as applicable, in the event
that failure to fulfill any material obligation of such Party (including
Sellers and the Company, in the case of Sellers) under this Agreement has been
the principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on
or before the Outside Date; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) by either Purchaser or Sellers' Representative (on behalf
of Sellers and the Company), if a Governmental Entity shall have issued a non-

breached or failed to perform any of their representations, warranties,
covenants, or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or
failure to perform would cause the conditions to the obligations of Purchaser
at the Closing to not be satisfied by the Outside Date and which breach or
failure, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured prior to the
earlier of (i) the Outside Date and (ii) 10 calendar days following receipt by
Sellers' Representative of written notice of such breach or failure from
Purchaser, with specific reference to the alleged facts underlying such breach
or failure and the conclusion it would lead to such conditions not being met;

 \t\t\t(vi) Sellers' Representative (on behalf of Sellers and the
Company), if Purchaser shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants, or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would cause the conditions to
the obligations of Sellers at the Closing to not be satisfied by the Outside
Date and which breach or failure, if capable of being cured, shall not have
been cured prior to the earlier of (i) the Outside Date or (ii) 10 calendar
days following receipt by Purchaser of written notice of such breach or

 \t\t\tSection 8.01 Liability for Taxes; Indemnification. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Each Group A Seller shall be, severally (and not jointly),
liable for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless each of Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company) and each of their
respective Representatives (the "Purchaser Indemnitees") against and hold it
harmless from, its Group A Pro Rata Share of any Losses suffered or incurred
by such Purchaser Indemnitee that are suffered or incurred at any time by any
of the Purchaser Indemnitees or to which any of the Purchaser Indemnitees may
otherwise become subject at any time (regardless of whether or not such Losses
relate to any Third Party Claim) arising out of, resulting from, involving or
otherwise in respect of: (i) Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may
otherwise be liable, for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the
Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date; (ii) Taxes for which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of the foregoing)
is held liable under Section 1.1502-6 of the United States Treasury
Regulations (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) by
reason of such entity being included in any consolidated, affiliated, combined
or unitary group at any time on or before the Closing Date; (iii) Taxes
imposed on or payable by third parties with respect to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify such third party
pursuant to a transaction consummated on or prior to the Closing; and (iv) any
breach of any covenant in this Article VIII or any representation or warranty
included in Section 3.14; provided, however, that such Group A Seller shall
have no liability under this Section 8.01(a) for any Taxes to the extent such
Taxes were specifically included in Indebtedness, as finally determined
pursuant to Section 1.05. \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Each Seller shall be, severally (and not jointly), liable
for and shall indemnify and hold harmless from, any Losses suffered or
incurred by such Purchaser Indemnitee that are suffered or incurred at any
time by any of the Purchaser Indemnitees or to which any of the Purchaser
Indemnitees may otherwise become subject at any time (regardless of whether or
not such Losses relate to any Third Party Claim) arising out of, resulting
from, involving or otherwise in respect of Taxes of such Seller for any
period. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) For purposes of this Section 8.01, whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of the
Company or such Subsidiary for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
and including the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the
Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at
the close of the Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of
the day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss
or credit of the Company or such Subsidiary for the Straddle Period shall be
allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books
basis" by assuming that the books of the Company or such Subsidiary were
closed at the close of the Closing Date; provided, however, that exemptions,
allowances, deductions or Taxes that are calculated on an annual basis, such
as property Taxes and depreciation deductions, shall be apportioned between
such two taxable years or periods on a daily basis. For the avoidance of
doubt, any amount owed by a Group A Seller to a Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant
to this Article VIII may, at the Purchaser Indemnitee's option, be set off
against the Indemnity Holdback Amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.02 Tax Returns. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Except for the Tax Returns described in Section 5.06(b)

by, on behalf of, or with respect to, the Company and its Subsidiaries, the
Company shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking into
account all extensions validly obtained) all such Tax Returns that are
required to be filed on, or prior to, the Closing Date, and Sellers shall
remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.
The Company shall provide a copy of all such Tax Returns to Purchaser for its
review at least 15 days prior to the due date thereof and shall make such
revisions to any such Tax Return as are reasonably requested in writing by
Purchaser. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement is governed by Internal Revenue Service Rev.
Rul. 99-6, Situation 2, and that for Tax purposes the Company will terminate
on the Closing Date pursuant to Code Section 708(b)(1). Following the
Closing, Sellers' Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared at its
own expense (and Purchaser and Sellers' Representative shall take such actions
necessary to cause to file), when due (taking into account all extensions
validly obtained) all Pass-Through Tax Returns of, or with respect to, the
Company for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, including
the U.S. federal partnership income Tax Return of the Company for its taxable
period that ends on the Closing Date. All such Pass-Through Tax Returns shall
be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law. Sellers' Representative shall deliver a
draft of each such Pass-Through Tax Return to Purchaser for review and comment
no less than 15 days before the due date thereof, and Sellers' Representative
shall make such revisions to any such Tax Return as are reasonably requested
in writing by Purchaser; provided that in the event that Purchaser and
Sellers' Representative are unable to resolve any dispute regarding any such
Tax Return, then Sellers' Representative shall file such Tax Return in
accordance with its good faith belief as to the positions required by
applicable Law and the terms of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Purchaser shall file, or cause to be filed, when due
(taking into account all extensions validly obtained) all other Tax Returns

 \t\t\tSection 8.02(b) that are required to be filed by, or with respect to,
the Company and its Subsidiaries that relate to a tax period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date; provided, that Purchaser shall
(i) provide any such Tax Return to Sellers' Representative for review and
comment no less than 15 days prior to the due date for timely filing of such
Tax Return, or, if the due date is within 30 days of the Closing Date, as
promptly as practical after the Closing Date, and (ii) make such revisions to
any such Tax Return as are reasonably requested in writing by Sellers'
Representative; provided, further, that in the event that Purchaser and
Sellers' Representative are unable to resolve any dispute regarding any such
Tax Return, then Purchaser shall file such Tax Return in accordance with its
good faith belief as to the positions required by applicable Law and the terms
of this Agreement. Prior to the later of (x) five Business Days before the
due date for timely filing of a Tax Return to be filed by Purchaser or (y) the
date that is three days after the date that such Tax Return is submitted to
Sellers' Representative for review and comment, each Group A Seller shall
remit or cause to be remitted to the Company or Purchaser any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns for which such Group A Seller is liable pursuant
to Section 8.01(a), net of any such Taxes that were specifically included in
Indebtedness, as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.05. Tax Returns that
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is required to file or cause to be
filed in accordance with this Section 8.02 shall be prepared and filed in a
manner consistent with the most recent past practice of the Company and the
terms of this Agreement, except to the extent otherwise required by Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall make reasonable
accommodations (including, if appropriate, the compilation of relevant
materials and the preparation of affected Tax Returns) to ensure that
Purchaser is able to meet its obligation to timely file any applicable Tax
Return that is required to be filed by or with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries that is due in the 45 days following the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate thereof shall, and
neither shall cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, (i)
unless required by applicable Law, amend any Tax Returns of or with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries filed with respect to any tax year ending on
or before the Closing Date or with respect to any Straddle Period or (ii) make
any Tax election that has retroactive effect to any such year or to any
Straddle Period and would reasonably be expected to increase the liability of
Sellers for Taxes under this Agreement, in each such case without the prior
written consent of Sellers' Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.03 Allocation Schedule. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Purchaser shall prepare a schedule in accordance with
Sections 751 and 1060 of the Code (and any other applicable Law), of a
purchase price allocation among the assets of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries that is either a partnership or disregarded as an entity separate
from the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which shall include a
methodology for allocating any Contingent Consideration that may become
payable pursuant to Section 1.05 (the "Allocation Schedule"). The primary,
but not sole, use of the Allocation Schedule will be to serve as the basis for
both Purchaser's and Sellers' disclosure statements which the Parties are
required to file with the tax authorities by applicable income tax
regulations, including, but not limited to, IRS Forms 8594 and 8308.
Purchaser shall provide a copy of the Allocation Schedule to Sellers'
Representative no later than March 16, 2020. By the Closing Date, Purchaser
and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with each other to prepare an estimate
of the amount to be reported as Class V assets on IRS Form(s) 8594, 8308 or
other applicable disclosure statement. Purchaser shall provide a preliminary
draft of the Allocation Schedule to Sellers' Representative within 75 days
after the Closing Date with the understanding that the amounts provided on
such preliminary draft will be estimates only and subject to change. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) During the 30-day period following Sellers'
Representative's receipt of the Allocation Schedule (and all supporting
schedule, work papers and other materials reasonably requested by Sellers'
Representative), Sellers' Representative and its auditors and Representatives
shall be permitted to \t\t

respective accountants relating to the Allocation Schedule, together with all
other reasonably requested materials relating to the Allocation Schedule,
including any materials prepared by Purchaser and/or its accountants;
provided, that Sellers' Representative and its auditors and Representatives
shall have executed all release letters reasonably requested by Purchaser's
and the Company's accountants in connection therewith. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Within 30 days of receipt of the Allocation Schedule
prepared in accordance with Section 8.03(a), Sellers' Representative shall
deliver to Purchaser written notice either accepting or objecting to the
Allocation Schedule, and if Sellers' Representative shall not have timely
delivered such written notice, Sellers' Representative shall be deemed to have
agreed to the Allocation Schedule, which shall become final and binding upon
the Parties. If Sellers' Representative timely objects to the Allocation
Schedule, then Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith for a period
of 30 days after Purchaser's receipt of Sellers' Representative's written
notice of objection to resolve their differences with respect to the
Allocation Schedule. Purchaser and Sellers' Representative shall each bear
their own costs incurred in connection with such negotiations. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) If Purchaser and Sellers' Representative are unable to
timely resolve their differences with respect to the Allocation Schedule, then
the Parties shall prepare separate allocations. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) If Sellers' Representative accepts the Allocation
Schedule, Sellers' Representative does not deliver timely notice to Purchaser
of its objection to the Allocation Schedule or Purchaser and Sellers'
Representative are able to timely resolve any differences with respect to the
Allocation Schedule, then: (i) the Company, Sellers and Purchaser shall file
any applicable IRS Form(s) 8594, 8308, and all other applicable federal, state
and local income Tax Returns in accordance with the Allocation Schedule, and
none of them shall thereafter take an income Tax Return position inconsistent
with such allocation except as otherwise required by applicable Law or unless
such inconsistent position shall arise out of or through an audit or other
inquiry or examination by the IRS or other taxing authority, (ii) the Parties
shall promptly advise one another of the existence of any Tax audit,
controversy or litigation related to any allocation hereunder and (iii) the
Allocation Schedule shall not establish any cap or other limitation on the
indemnification obligations of the Parties. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.04 Tax Contests. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Sellers' Representative shall, at the expense of Group A
Sellers, control any audit, litigation, or other Proceeding in respect of a
Pass-Through Tax Return that relates to a taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date; provided, that Sellers' Representative (i) shall keep
Purchaser reasonably informed regarding such Proceeding and shall consider
Purchaser's suggestions and comments in good faith; and (ii) shall not settle
any such audit, litigation or Proceeding (or such portion thereof) that could
have any adverse effect that is material on Purchaser, the Company or their
Affiliates without the prior written consent of Purchaser (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Purchaser shall, at its
expense, control any other audit, litigation, or other Proceeding in respect
of Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, that if
and solely to the extent that such audit, litigation or other Proceeding
relates to Taxes for a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before
the Closing Date (including in regard to a Straddle Period) for which Group A
Sellers would be required to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to
Section 8.01, Purchaser (A) shall keep Sellers' Representative reasonably
informed regarding such proceeding, including by providing copies of all
notices and other written correspondence received from a Governmental Entity
in connection therewith, (B) shall allow Sellers' Representative to
participate in such Proceeding, which participation rights shall include the
right to review relevant material correspondence and to attend relevant
material conference calls and meetings with the applicable Governmental Entity
(to the extent permitted by applicable Law), (C) shall incorporate Sellers'
Representative's reasonable suggestions and comments regarding such
Proceeding, and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t57  \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(D) shall not settle such audit, litigation or Proceeding (or a
portion thereof, including any portion that would result in a material
liability for Sellers) without the prior written consent of Sellers'
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed
or withheld. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Neither the Company nor any Seller shall cause the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that are treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes to elect under Section 1101(g)(4) of Title XI of the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, H.R. 1314, Public Law Number 114‑74 (the
"Budget Act") to have the amendments made by such provisions apply to any Tax
Return of such entity relating to any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date. With respect to any taxable period of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that are treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes to which Section 1101 of the Budget Act applies and that ends on or
before the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause such entity to make an election
pursuant to Section 6226 of the Code, and shall cause such entity to follow
the procedures required in connection with such election, to make inapplicable
to such entity the requirement in Section 6225 of the Code that such entity
pay any "imputed underpayment" (within the meaning of Section 6225 of the
Code). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Sellers shall be entitled to the amount of any refund or
credit in lieu of a cash refund of Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to any Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date (to the extent such Taxes were paid by the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing or by Sellers after the Closing) which
refund or credit is actually recognized by Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) after the Closing, net of any
cost to Purchaser and its Affiliates attributable to the obtaining and receipt
of such refund or credit, except to the extent such refund or credit arises as
the result of a carryback of a loss or other tax benefit from a Tax period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Sellers' Representative (to be distributed to Group A
Sellers in accordance with their Group A Pro Rata Shares) any amount to which
Group A Sellers are entitled pursuant to the prior sentence within 15 days
after the receipt or recognition of the applicable refund or credit by
Purchaser or its Affiliates. To the extent such refund or credit is
subsequently disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable
Governmental Entity, Sellers agree promptly to repay the amount of such refund
or credit, together with any interest, penalties or other additional amounts
imposed by such Governmental Entity, to Purchaser. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent there is any
conflict in this Section 8.04 and Section 9.05, this Section 8.04 shall
govern. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.05 Tax Reimbursements. Each Seller shall reimburse
any Purchaser Indemnitee for any Taxes for which such Seller is responsible
pursuant to Section 8.01 upon written request setting forth in detail the
computation of the amount owed by such Seller. Each such reimbursement shall
be made no more than 10 days after the date upon which such request was
made. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.06 Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing
Date, each of Sellers and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates and Representatives to): \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may
be necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise
reduce), or file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described
in Section 5.06(b) (relating to Transfer Taxes); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) assist the other Party in preparing any Tax Returns which
such other Party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with
Section 8.02, which assistance shall include providing copies of relevant Tax
Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related
work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
relevant Governmental Entities; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t58  \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) cooperate as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
other Party fully in preparing for and defending any audits of, or disputes
with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, which cooperation shall include providing copies of relevant Tax
Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related
work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
relevant Governmental Entities; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) make available to the other Party as reasonably requested
all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the Company and
its Subsidiaries pertaining to a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on
or before the Closing Date; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) furnish the other Party with copies of all correspondence
received from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or
information request with respect to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company
and its Subsidiaries; provided, that Purchaser shall only be obligated to
furnish copies of such correspondence to Sellers' Representative to the extent
such audit or information request relates to Taxes for which Sellers may be
liable under the terms of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.07 Retention of Documents. Sellers' Representative
and Purchaser shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records
and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to
which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to
extensions except to the extent notified by another party hereto in writing of
such extensions for the respective Tax periods. Prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records
and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date,
Sellers Representative or Purchaser (as the case may be) shall provide the
other parties hereto with reasonable written notice and offer the other
parties hereto the opportunity to take custody of such materials. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.08 Termination of Tax Allocation Arrangements. Any
Tax allocation, Tax indemnity or Tax sharing agreement between the Company and
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any one or more Sellers or Affiliates
of Sellers, on the other hand, shall be terminated as to the Company and its
Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing, and after the Closing the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not have any liability thereunder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.09 Limitation on Seller Rights. Notwithstanding
anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement
shall give any Seller any right to access or review any Tax Return or Tax
information except to the extent such Tax Return or Tax information relates to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, no Seller
(including Sellers' Representative) shall have any right to access or review
any Tax Return or Tax information to the extent the same is not related to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.10 Survival, Etc. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement (including Section 9.01 and Section 9.03 through
Section 9.06): the obligations of the Parties set forth in this Article VIII
shall survive the Closing until 45 days after the expiration of all applicable
statutes of limitation (taking into account extensions thereof); provided,
however, that if, at any time on or prior to the expiration date referred to
in this sentence, any Purchaser Indemnitee delivers to Sellers' Representative
a written notice asserting a claim for recovery under this Article VIII based
on such alleged breach, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive
until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved (for the avoidance
of doubt, no claim made pursuant to this Article VIII shall be subject to the
limitations in Section 9.04). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.11 Withholding. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Purchaser and any of Purchaser's Representatives (including,
following the Closing, the Company) that has any withholding obligation with
respect to any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to any payee
such amounts as Purchaser or any of its Representatives determines in good
faith are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom or in connection
therewith under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law
or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted
or withheld, and provided that such amounts are remitted to the appropriate
Tax authorities, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the payee to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.12 Contingent Consideration. For U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income tax purposes, Purchaser shall report the
payment of the Contingent Consideration as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
paid in exchange for Membership Interests (and not as compensation for
services); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply if the
applicable Tax authority determines that such reporting is not
permitted. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.13 Seller Transaction Expenses. For the avoidance of
doubt, all Seller Transaction Expenses that are paid or incurred at Closing
pursuant to Section 1.03(c)(ii) will be allocated to Sellers or the Company to
the taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date and, to the extent
allowed or allowable under the Code or other applicable Law, shall be deducted
on the applicable federal and state income Tax Return(s) for the period ending
on the Closing Date. \t\t

FRC Modern Steak Scottsdale LLC, FRC Cityscape II LLC and FC Investors

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Subject to the limitations set forth herein, from and
after the Closing, each Seller shall be, severally (and not jointly), except
as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 9.01(d)(i), liable for, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser Indemnitee against and hold it
harmless from, any Losses suffered or incurred by such Purchaser Indemnitee
arising out of, resulting from, involving or otherwise in respect of: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) any breach of any representation or warranty (x)

Seller shall not have any liability: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) for claims for indemnification made exclusively pursuant
to Section 9.01(a)(i) or Section 9.01(b)(i) for any individual or series of
related Losses which do not exceed $10,000 (which Losses shall not be counted
toward the Deductible); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) for claims for indemnification made exclusively pursuant
to Section 9.01(a)(i) or Section 9.01(b)(i) unless the aggregate amount of all
Losses for which Sellers would, but for this clause (ii), be liable thereunder
exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $1,000,000 (the
"Deductible"), after which Sellers shall be liable for all such Losses in
excess of the Deductible; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) for claims for indemnification made exclusively pursuant
to Section 9.01(a)(i) or Section 9.01(b)(i) in excess of the sum of the
aggregate balance in the Indemnity Holdback Amount (the "Cap"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tprovided, however, that the limitations set forth in this clause (c)
shall not apply to any claims of, or causes of action arising out of,
involving or otherwise in respect of (x) any Fundamental Representation of
Sellers or the Company (other than Section 3.18 (Plans), to which the
limitations set forth in this clause (c) shall apply), or (y) fraud. Without
limiting the effect of any of the other limitations set forth in this
Agreement (including those set forth above), the aggregate liability of a
Seller for Losses under Article VIII and Section 9.01 shall not exceed an
amount equal to the Purchase Price actually received by such Seller, provided
that such limitation shall not apply to any claims of, or causes of action
arising out of, involving or otherwise in respect of fraud. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) The amounts available in the Indemnity Holdback Amount
shall be security for the indemnity or other payment obligations set forth in
Section 8.01(a), Section 8.01(b) (solely with respect to the indemnity or
other payment obligations of Group A Sellers), Section 9.01(a) and Section
9.01(b), and the amounts available in the other portion of the Deferred

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tthe payment obligations set forth in Section 1.05(g). The indemnity
or other payment obligations set forth in Section 8.01(a), Section 9.01(a)
and Section 9.01(b) shall be deemed made on (i) a joint and several basis
solely to the extent of (x) the Indemnity Holdback Amount and (y) fraud of the
Company and (ii) on a several but not joint basis based on each such Seller's
Pro Rata Share thereof to the extent such obligations are in excess of the
amounts referenced in the foregoing clause (x) (and in cases in which the
foregoing clause (y) does not apply). The indemnity or other payment
obligations set forth in Section 8.01(b) of each Group A Seller may be
satisfied from the Indemnity Holdback Amount in an amount up to such Group A
Seller's Group A Pro Rata Share of the Indemnity Holdback Amount, and such
indemnity or other payment obligation of each Seller otherwise shall be
satisfied by such Seller individually in an amount equal to such Seller's
indemnity or other payment obligations thereunder. Notwithstanding the
immediately two preceding sentences, in the case of (A) any claim for
indemnification made pursuant to Section 9.01(b)(i) for a breach of a
representation or warranty of any particular Seller set forth in Article II,
including, without limitation, as applicable to such Seller(s) obligations
under any Ancillary Agreement, or in any certificate delivered by such
Seller(s) pursuant to this Agreement, (B) any claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.01(b)(ii) for a breach of a covenant by any particular
Seller or (C) any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.01(b) for
Taxes of any Seller for any period (in any such case, such Seller being
referred to herein as the "Responsible Seller" and such claims being referred
to herein as the "Seller Specific Claims"), the applicable Purchaser
Indemnitee(s) will have the right to (x) except for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.01(b) for Taxes of any Group B Seller
for any period, receive the Losses from the Indemnity Holdback Amount in
accordance with Section 9.05(e), in which case each applicable Responsible
Seller will be obligated to promptly contribute to the Indemnity Holdback
Amount the amount of Losses arising from the breach that are allocable to such
Responsible Seller to replenish such portion of the Indemnity Holdback Amount
or provide additional funds to the Indemnity Holdback Amount, and (y) pursue
the indemnification claim directly against each Responsible Seller responsible
for the breach or other claim in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
(and each Responsible Seller will be required to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees for all Losses arising from such claim against such Responsible
Seller for indemnification), in each case subject to the limitations set forth
in this Article IX, including Section 9.01(c) (as applicable). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.02 Indemnification by Purchaser. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be liable for
and shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and their respective
Representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") against and hold each
of them harmless from any Loss suffered or incurred by such Seller Indemnitee
arising out of, resulting from, involving or otherwise in respect of: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser
contained in Article IV or in any certificate delivered by Purchaser pursuant
to this Agreement; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) any breach by Purchaser or by the Company from and after
Closing of any covenant or other agreement contained herein. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Purchaser shall not have any liability or claims for
indemnification made exclusively pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i): \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) unless the aggregate of all Losses for which Purchaser
would, but for this clause (i), be liable thereunder exceeds on a cumulative
basis an amount equal to the Deductible, in which event Purchaser shall be
liable for all such Losses in excess of the Deductible; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) in excess of the Cap; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tprovided, however, that the limitations set forth in this clause (b)
shall not apply to any claims of, or causes of action arising out of,
involving or otherwise in respect of (x) any Fundamental Representation of
Purchaser, and for which liability of Purchaser (together with all other
liabilities of Purchaser under this Article IX) shall not exceed an amount
equal to the Purchase Price, or (y) fraud. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.03 Calculation of Losses. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is
provided under Article VIII or this Article IX shall be net of any amounts
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under any insurance policy with
respect to such Loss (net of any related deductible, expenses incurred in
securing such recovery or retroactive or other premium adjustments directly
attributable thereto) or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
with respect to such Loss. The Indemnified Parties shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to seek any such insurance recoveries or indemnity,
contribution or other similar payments, but seeking such recovery shall not be
a condition to indemnification under this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Purchaser and Sellers agree to report each indemnification
payment made in respect of any Losses as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes unless the Indemnified Party determines
in good faith that such reporting position is incorrect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) No Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as the case
may be, shall be entitled to recover any Losses relating to any matter arising
under one provision of this Agreement to the extent that the Purchaser
Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, respectively, have already recovered Losses
with respect to such matter pursuant to third party insurance policies, or any
indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements, as provided in Section
9.03(a) and/or other provisions of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) For purposes of Article VIII or this Article IX, any
qualifications in the representations, warranties and covenants with respect
to a Company Material Adverse Effect, materiality, material or similar terms
(except to the extent such terms are used to qualify descriptions or lists of
assets and liabilities and other items required to be disclosed on the Company
Disclosure Schedule) shall be disregarded and will not have any effect with
respect to the determination of whether or not a breach has, in fact,
occurred, or the calculation of the amount of any Losses attributable to a
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Schedule). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is
provided under Article VIII or this Article IX shall be reduced by an amount
equal to any Tax benefit actually realized as a result of such Loss in the
taxable year in which such Loss occurs by the Indemnified Party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its
Affiliates to take, reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware
of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does,
give rise thereto, including incurring costs only as commercially reasonable
to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Loss. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.04 Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants
and Agreements; Termination of Indemnification. Except in the case of fraud,
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein
shall survive the Closing as follows: (a) the Fundamental Representations
shall survive for 45 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations; (b) all other representations and warranties in Article II,
Article III and Article IV shall survive until the date that is three (3)
years after the Closing Date; and (c) the covenants to be performed prior to,
at or following the Closing shall survive the Closing and remain in full force
and effect until performed in accordance with their terms. Except in

 \t\t\tcase of fraud, the obligations to indemnify and hold harmless any
Party (i) pursuant to Section 9.01(a)(i), Section 9.01(b)(i) or Section
9.02(a)(i) shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty
terminates in accordance with this Section 9.04, (ii) pursuant to Section
9.01(a)(ii), Section 9.01(b)(ii) or Section 9.02(a)(ii) shall terminate when
the applicable covenant terminates in accordance with this Section 9.04, and
(iii) pursuant to the other clauses of Section 9.01(a), Section 9.01(b) and
Section 9.02(a) shall terminate when satisfied or performed in accordance with
their terms; provided, however, that such obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the
Indemnified Party shall have in good faith, before the expiration of the
applicable survival period set forth in this Section 9.04, made a claim by
delivering a notice of such claim in accordance with Section 9.05 to the
Indemnifying Party (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such claim need not be
filed in a court or other tribunal prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival period). \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) In order for a Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee
(as the case may be, the "Indemnified Party") to assert any claim for
indemnification provided for under Section 8.01, Section 9.01(a), Section
9.01(b) or Section 9.02(a) in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim
made by any Person not a party hereto against the Indemnified Party (a "Third
Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party (the
"Indemnifying Party") promptly in writing of such Third Party Claim (the
"Third Party Claim Notice") (setting forth in reasonable detail the facts
giving rise to such Third Party Claim (to the extent known by the Indemnified
Party) and the amount or estimated amount (to the extent reasonably estimable)
of Losses arising out of, involving or otherwise in respect of such Third
Party Claim); provided, however, that (i) failure to give such Third Party
Claim Notice shall not affect the indemnification rights and obligations
provided hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have
forfeited rights or defenses by reason of such failure, in which case such
failure shall constitute a waiver of the rights of the Indemnified Party under
this Section 9.05(a) only to the extent of such forfeiture, and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall not be bound by or limited to any estimate of Losses
set forth in the Third Party Claim Notice and shall not lose any right to
indemnification for any failure to provide such reasonable detail. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Except for any Special Third Party Claim, if the
Indemnifying Party provides written notice to the Indemnified Party within 10
Business Days after receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice in respect of a
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled if it so
elects, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense thereof and
(unless (i) a conflict of interest exists and the Indemnified Party determines
in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate or (ii) the
Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified
Party of its financial capacity to defend such Third Party Claim), if it so
chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance
with this Section 9.05(b), (A) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
consult in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnified Party's cost
and expense; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall be liable
for the fees, costs and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party
(x) for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the
defense of such Third Party Claim, or (y) if the joint representation of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by a single law firm with respect
to such Third Party Claim involves conflicts of interest and the Indemnified
Party determines in good faith that joint representation would be
inappropriate, (B) the Indemnified Party shall make available to the
Indemnifying Party all non-privileged books, records, and other documents and
materials that are under the direct or indirect control of the Indemnified
Party or any of the Indemnified Party's Representatives and that the
Indemnifying Party reasonably requests for the defense of such Third Party
Claim, (C) the Indemnified Party shall otherwise reasonably cooperate as
requested by the Indemnifying Party in the defense of such Third Party Claim,
and (D) the Indemnifying \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tParty shall not enter into any agreement providing for the settlement
or compromise of such Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of a judgment
with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement (1) does not involve any
finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of
any Person, (2) does not involve any relief other than monetary damages that
are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and does not restrict the
Indemnified Party or the conduct of any of its or its Affiliates' businesses
or operations, (3) does not involve or relate to Taxes and (4) completely,
finally and unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party and its
Representatives in connection with such Third Party Claim. Any such
participation or assumption shall not constitute a waiver by any Party of any
attorney-client privilege in connection with such Third Party Claim. If the
consent of Indemnified Party is required pursuant to the foregoing clause (D)
and the Indemnified Party fails to provide such consent within ten Business
Days after the Indemnifying Party provides a written request therefor, then
the Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim
and in such event, unless the Indemnified Party's consent has been reasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying
Party as to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such
settlement offer. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of a Third
Party Claim in accordance with this Section 9.05(b) and the Indemnifying Party
does not, within ten Business Days after such Third Party Claim Notice is
given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 9.05, then
the Indemnified Party shall control the defense of such Third Party Claim with
counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (and the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the
Indemnified Party in defending such Third Party Claim, but not in duplication
of any such amounts claimed by such Indemnified Party as Losses in connection
therewith); provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall not enter
into any agreement providing for the settlement or compromise of such Third
Party Claim or consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless
such settlement (1) does not lead to any liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and (2)
completely, finally and unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party and its
Representatives in connection with such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim (and shall be liable for the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending such
Third Party Claim, but not in duplication of any such amounts claimed by such
Indemnified Party as Losses in connection therewith) if (w) the Third Party
Claim involves monetary damages in excess of the amount then available as part
of the Indemnity Holdback Amount, (x) the Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction or other equitable relief or relief other than monetary damages
(including a Third Party Claim that would, if adversely determined, restrict
such Indemnified Party or the conduct of its or its Affiliates' business or
operations or that would, if adversely determined, be reasonably likely to
establish an adverse precedential effect or negative publicity for such
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates), (y) the Third Party Claim relates to
Taxes that pertains to any Straddle Period or any Tax Period beginning after
the Closing Date, or (z) the Third Party Claim is a criminal Proceeding
brought by a Governmental Entity or other Person or otherwise involves or
seeks any potential criminal liability (each such Third Party Claim described
in the preceding clauses (w), (x), (y) and (z) constituting a "Special Third
Party Claim"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses and is permitted
hereunder to defend any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) cause, or agree
to, the waiver of the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product
immunity or any other privilege or protection in respect of confidential legal
memoranda and other privileged materials drafted by, or otherwise reflecting
the legal advice of, internal or outside counsel of an Indemnified Party (the
"Subject Materials") relating to such Third Party Claim. Each Party mutually
acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that (i) each
shares a common legal interest in preparing for the defense of legal
proceedings, or potential \t\t

actual or threatened Third Party Claim or any related claim or counterclaim,
(ii) the sharing of Subject Materials will further such common legal interest
and (iii) by disclosing any Subject Materials to and/or sharing any Subject
Materials with the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall not waive
the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product immunity or any other
privilege or protection. The Indemnified Party shall not be required to make
available to the Indemnifying Party any information that is subject to an
attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege that based on the advice
of outside counsel would be impaired by such disclosure or any confidentiality
restriction under applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) In the event any Indemnified Party has a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under Section 9.01(a), Section 9.01(b) or Section 9.02(a)
that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver
written notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party (setting forth in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such claim (to the extent known by
the Indemnified Party), including the specific representation, warranty or
covenant alleged to be the basis of such claim, and the amount or estimated
amount (to the extent reasonably estimable) of Losses arising out of,
involving or otherwise in respect of such claim) with reasonable promptness
after becoming aware of such claim but such to the limitations set forth in
Section 9.04; provided, however, that (i) failure to give such notice shall
not affect the indemnification rights and obligations provided hereunder
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have forfeited rights
or defenses by reason of such failure, in which case such failure shall
constitute a waiver of the rights of the Indemnified Party under this Section
9.05(d) only to the extent of such forfeiture, and (ii) the Indemnified Party
shall not be bound by or limited to any estimate of Losses set forth in such
notice and shall not lose any right to indemnification for any failure to
provide such reasonable detail. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) If Purchaser desires to make a claim against the Indemnity
Holdback Amount pursuant to Article VIII or this Article IX, Purchaser shall
provide written notice thereof to Sellers' Representative (a "Claim Notice")
before the three-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Final Release
Date"), which Claim Notice shall (i) in reasonable detail state the basis for
such claim, and (ii) state the amount being claimed by Purchaser against the
Indemnity Holdback Amount (the "Claim Amount"). Purchaser may set off and
apply the Claim Amount against the Indemnity Holdback Amount 30 days following
the date on which Purchaser provided Sellers' Representative the Claim Notice,
unless, within such 30-day period, Sellers' Representative delivers written
notice to Purchaser objecting to the Claim Notice and identifying the amount
of the Claim Amount which Sellers' Representative disputes (any such objection
notice, an "Indemnity Objection"). In the event that Purchaser receives an
Indemnity Objection, then Purchaser shall set off and apply the portion of the
Claim Amount, if any, which is not subject to dispute in the Indemnity
Objection against the Indemnity Holdback Amount, and the portion of the Claim
Amount that is subject to a dispute in the Indemnity Objection (the "Disputed
Portion") shall remain part of the Indemnity Holdback Amount (and shall not be
disbursed to Sellers' Representative pursuant to Section 1.04) until (x)
Purchaser and Sellers' Representative mutually resolve the Indemnity Objection
pursuant to a written agreement, or (y) Purchaser or Sellers' Representative
receives a Final Order with respect thereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) The funds included in the Indemnity Holdback Amount shall
be distributed as set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if a Purchaser Indemnitee recovers Losses from the Indemnity Holdback Amount
in accordance with the last sentence of Section 9.01(d) and the applicable
Responsible Seller fails to replenish the Indemnity Holdback Amount in
accordance with such sentence, then the amount of any payment that would
otherwise be made to the Responsible Seller in accordance with this Agreement
will be reduced dollar for dollar based on the amount of Losses relating
thereto that were recovered by the Purchaser Indemnitee against the Indemnity
Holdback Amount. Any other indemnification pursuant to Article VIII and this
Article IX shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds
by the applicable Indemnifying Party(ies) to an account designated by \t\t

 \t\t\tPurchaser (with respect to any Purchaser Indemnitee) and Sellers'
Representative (with respect to any Seller Indemnitee) after the determination
of the amount thereof, whether pursuant to a Final Order, settlement or
agreement among the Parties. All indemnification payments made (or deemed
made) under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) No Seller will have any right to reimbursement or
contribution from, subrogation to or indemnification from the Company with
respect to any indemnification claim of a Purchaser Indemnitee against any
Seller under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with this Agreement.
Payments by a Party of amounts for which such Party is indemnified under this
Agreement will not be a condition precedent to recovery. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.06 Exclusive Remedy. Except (a) in the case of fraud
(the Parties' rights and remedies for which shall not be restricted or
otherwise limited hereunder), and (b) the rights and remedies set forth in
Section 1.04, Section 1.05, and Section 10.09, the right of each Party hereto
to assert indemnification claims and receive indemnification payments pursuant
to Article VIII and this Article IX shall, from and after the Closing Date, be
the sole and exclusive right and remedy exercisable by such Party with respect
to any breach by any other Party of any covenant, representation, warranty, or
otherwise under or relating to this Agreement; provided, that for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement (including clause (a) of this
Section 9.06) shall be deemed to restrict any Indemnified Party from asserting
any indemnification claims and receiving indemnification payments (without
giving effect to any limits set forth in Article VIII and this Article IX)
pursuant to Article VIII and this Article IX in respect of any claims for
fraud. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.07 No Set Off. Purchaser shall not have the right to
set off the Contingent Consideration Amount, and Brand Sale Consideration or
any Adjustment Amount owed to Group A Sellers against any amounts then subject
to a pending indemnification claim by a Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to
Article VIII or this Article IX. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.01 Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and
obligations hereunder shall not be assignable by Purchaser, the Company, or
any Seller without the prior written consent of Purchaser (in the case of
assignment by the Company, or any Seller) or Sellers' Representative (in the
case of an assignment by Purchaser). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser
may, without the consent of any other Party, assign all or any portion of its
rights and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate or Affiliates of Purchaser.
No such assignment shall release Purchaser from any of its obligations
hereunder without the consent of Sellers' Representative. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.02 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Except as provided in Article VIII and Article IX
(including with respect to any Indemnified Party, who shall be considered a
third party beneficiary of this Agreement) and the last two sentences of this
Section 10.02, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto
and their permitted successors and assigns and nothing herein expressed or
implied shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the
Parties hereto and such successors and assigns, any legal or equitable rights
hereunder. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) with Guarantor or
its \t\t

 \t\t\tSubsidiaries, and no provision of this Agreement shall create any such
rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided,
directly or indirectly, under any Plan, and nothing in this Agreement will
constitute an amendment of any Plan or impose any obligations on Purchaser
under any Plan. The Purchaser Financing Sources shall be express third party
beneficiaries of this Section 10.02 and Section 10.06, Section 10.09,
Section 10.10, Section 10.11 and Section 10.12, each of such Sections shall
expressly inure to the benefit of the Purchaser Financing Sources and the
Purchaser Financing Sources shall be entitled to rely on and enforce the
provisions of such Sections. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
each Seller hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that none of the
Purchaser Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to any
Seller under or in connection with this Agreement, any commitment letter,
engagement letter or definitive financing document (including the Purchaser
Loan Agreement) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including with respect to the Purchaser Financing). Each Seller hereby
waives any and all rights or claims and causes of action (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Purchaser Financing
Sources that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, any
commitment letter, engagement letter or definitive financing document
(including the Purchaser Loan Agreement) or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Purchaser Financing), and each
Seller agrees not to commence or support a proceeding against any Purchaser
Financing Source in connection with this Agreement or any commitment letter,
engagement letter or definitive financing document (including the Purchaser
Loan Agreement) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including any proceeding related to the Purchaser Financing). Nothing in
this Section 10.02 will limit the rights of Purchaser in respect of the
Purchaser Financing under the Purchaser Loan Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, no Purchaser Financing Source shall be subject to any special,
consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature to
any Seller. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.04 Interpretation; Exhibits and Schedules; Certain
Definitions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The headings contained herein and in any Exhibit or
Schedule hereto, the table of contents hereto and the index of defined terms
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation hereof. All Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or referred
to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part hereof as if set forth in
full herein. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit, but not
otherwise defined therein, shall have the meaning as defined herein. When a
reference is made herein to a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference
shall be to a Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred
to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means
such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified
or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by
waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. References to a Person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. For all purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise
specified herein, (i) "or" shall be construed in the inclusive sense of
"and/or"; (ii) words (including capitalized terms defined herein) in the
singular shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa and words
(including capitalized terms defined herein) of one gender shall be construed
to include the other gender as the context requires; (iii) the terms "hereof"
and "herein" and words of similar import shall be construed to refer to this
Agreement as a whole (including all the Exhibits and Schedules) and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement; (iv) the terms "including" and
"include" mean "including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing";
and (v) all references herein to "$" or dollars shall refer to United States
dollars. Each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement contained
herein shall have independent significance. Accordingly, if any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein is breached,
the fact that there exists another representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) shall not detract from or mitigate the breach of the
first representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Except to the extent a
shorter time period is expressly set forth herein for a particular cause of
action, actions hereunder may be brought at any time prior to the expiration
of the longest time period permitted by applicable Law. When calculating the
period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to be
done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference
date in calculating such period shall be excluded, and if the last day of such
period is a non-Business Day, the period in question \t\t

other item shall be deemed to have been "made available" or "provided" to
Purchaser for all purposes of this Agreement only if such document, list or
other item was posted no later than two Business Days before the date hereof
in the electronic datarooms established by the Company in connection with the
Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) For all purposes hereof: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t"4-Wall EBITDA" means, with respect to the Eligible Restaurants open
and operating during the Measurement Period, the aggregate earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, management fees and general
and administrative expenses of such Eligible Restaurants for the Measurement
Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sellers' Representative uses a
portion of the Deferred Payment Holdback Amount to pay bonuses to the
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries and such bonuses are deducted
from 4-Wall EBITDA as a compensation expense, then the amount of such
compensation expenses so deducted shall be added back to 4-Wall EBITDA
(without duplication of any other amount added back to 4-Wall EBITDA). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t"Accounting Firm" means an independent accounting firm of national
recognition reasonably acceptable to both Purchaser and Sellers'
Representative. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t"Accounting Principles" means the fair presentation and accurate
presentation, in all material respects, of the balance sheet and statements of
operations, members' capital and cash flows of the Company in accordance with
GAAP but with potential deviations from GAAP in the following areas: minority
interest, leases, revenue classification, gift cards and asset
impairment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t"Acquisition" has the meaning set forth in Section 1.01. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t"Acquisition Transaction" has the meaning set forth in Section
5.03(a). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t"Adjustment Amount" has the meaning set forth in Section
1.05(g). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t"Affiliate" of any Person means another Person that directly or
indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or
is under common control with, such first Person. For purposes of this
definition, the term "control" (including its correlative meanings "controlled
by" and "under common control with") means possession, directly or indirectly,
of power to direct or cause the direction of management or policies (whether
through ownership of securities or partnership or other ownership interests,
by contract or otherwise). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t"Aggregate TTM 4-Wall Margin" means the quotient of (i) the 4-Wall
EBITDA of all Eligible Restaurants for the Measurement Period (or, for
purposes of Section 4.03 of Exhibit G, the final day of the applicable
Financial Month), divided by (ii) the aggregate Sales of such Eligible
Restaurants for the Measurement Period (or, for purposes of Section 4.03 of
Exhibit G, the trailing twelve Financial Months ending with the applicable
Financial Month). Aggregate TTM 4-Wall Margin shall be adjusted for new store
performances (i.e., reduced by each store's operating results between the
opening of each store and the end of its sixth full Financial Month). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t "Aggregate TTM 4-Wall Margin Floor" means 14%; provided, however,
that if the Aggregate TTM 4-Wall Margin for the Company's fiscal year ended
January 1, 2019 (as calculated based on the GAAP Financial Statements) differs
from the Aggregate TTM 4-Wall Margin for such fiscal year (as calculated based
on the Financial Statements) and the difference between the two is greater
than 50 basis points, then "Aggregate TTM 4-Wall Margin" shall be
correspondingly adjusted based on the \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tapplication of the accounting methods, practices, principles, policies
and procedures applied in the GAAP Financial Statements (as opposed to those
applied in the Financial Statements). \t\t

 \t\t

hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Company and each
Seller the full and timely payment, performance and satisfaction of each
covenant, agreement, obligation and liability of Purchaser arising under this
Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements (collectively, the "Purchaser
Obligations"). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Guarantor
hereby expressly waives any and all rights and defenses arising by reason of
any Law that would otherwise require any election of remedies by the Company
or any Seller. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Guarantor
hereby expressly waives: (i) notice of the acceptance by the Company or an
Seller of this guarantee; (ii) notice of the non-performance of all or any of
the Purchaser Obligations; (iii) presentment, demand, notice of dishonor,
protest, notice of protest and all other notices whatsoever, either in respect
of Purchaser's obligations under this Section 10.17(a) or any or all of the
Purchaser Obligations; (iv) any defense arising by reason of any claim or
defense based upon an election of remedies, including the failure or delay in
exercising remedies against Purchaser, by the Company or any Seller which in
any manner affects any of its rights to proceed against Guarantor; (v) any
defense arising by reason of any modification, termination or release of any
of the Purchaser Obligations pursuant to applicable Law; and (vi) any defense
arising from the bankruptcy or insolvency of Purchaser. Guarantor agrees that
its liability hereunder shall be primary and direct, not merely of collection
and not merely that \t\t

 \t\t\tof a surety, and that neither the Company nor any Seller shall be
required to pursue any right or remedy it may have against Guarantor under
this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements or otherwise or to first
commence any proceeding or obtain any judgment against Purchaser in order to
enforce this Section 10.17(a). In the event that any payment to the Company
or any Seller in respect of the Purchaser Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, Guarantor shall remain liable
hereunder with respect to the Purchaser Obligations as if such payment had not
been made. This Section 10.17(a) represents a continuing guarantee and shall
be binding upon Guarantor until the Purchaser Obligations have been satisfied
and (if applicable) indefeasibly paid in full. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 10.17(a), the Company and Sellers hereby agree that (i) to the extent
Purchaser is relieved of all or any portion of the Purchaser Obligations by
full satisfaction thereof on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement or pursuant to any other written agreement with the Company
and Sellers, Guarantor shall be similarly relieved of its corresponding
obligations under Section 10.17(a), and (ii) Guarantor shall have all defenses
to the payment of its obligations under Section 10.17(a) that would otherwise
be available to Purchaser under the terms of this Agreement with respect to
the Purchaser Obligations. \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Each Seller hereby appoints Sellers' Representative as
such Seller's true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of
substitution and resubstitution, in such Seller's name, place and stead, in

the conditions, provisions and covenants of any instruments or documents that
may be executed by it pursuant hereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Neither Sellers' Representative nor any agent employed by

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Each Seller hereby irrevocably agrees, severally and not

aggregate Pro Rata Shares of Sellers who shall succeed Sellers' Representative
as "Sellers' Representative" hereunder. \t\t
