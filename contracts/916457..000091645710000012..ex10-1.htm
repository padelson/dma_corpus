2.04 Post-Closing Payment. Following the Closing, a payment may be required to
be paid by Purchaser to Holdings, or by Holdings to Purchaser, as provided in
this Section 2.04.

  

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, but no later than 60 days
immediately following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to
Purchaser a written notice (the "Proposed Post-Closing Payment Notice")
setting forth the determination made by Parent of the proposed Purchase Price
and the proposed Post-Closing Payment Amount required as a result of Parent's
determination. Prior to and following delivery of the Proposed Post-Closing
Payment Notice, each party shall provide the other party and its respective
Representatives with such access to the applicable personnel, books, records,
information, materials and data of the Companies, Parent, Holdings, and
Purchaser, as applicable, and their respective Affiliates as reasonably
requested by each party, for the purposes of allowing the other party to
determine, and verify the accuracy of the determination of, the calculations
in the Proposed Post-Closing Payment Notice, including, with respect to
Purchaser, for the purpose of conducting an audit of the Closing Date
Inventory Cost (which may occur prior to receipt of the Parent Proposed Post-
Closing Payment Notice). Each party shall cooperate with the other party to
assist in their respective review of the Proposed Post-Closing Payment Notice,
and, if requested by either party, the other party and its Representatives
shall meet in person with the requesting party to discuss the Proposed Post-
Closing Payment Notice.

  

  

(b) The Proposed Post-Closing Payment Notice shall become final and binding
upon the parties on the 60th day following delivery thereof unless Purchaser
provides written notice of its disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement") to
Parent prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted.

  

  

(c) If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Parent within the 60-day period
referred to in Section 2.04(b), then the Proposed Post-Closing Payment Notice
(as revised in accordance with this sentence) shall become final and binding
upon the parties on the earlier of (i) the date Parent and Purchaser resolve
in writing all differences they have with respect to the matters specified in
the Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the date all disputed matters are finally
resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm. During the 14-day period following
the timely delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Parent and Purchaser shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may
have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If
there is no resolution as to any matter within such 14-day period, then within
five Business Days after the end of such 14-day period, Parent and Purchaser
shall submit to the Accounting Firm for arbitration, in accordance with the
standards set forth in this

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-27-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Section 2.04, only the matters that remain in dispute and were included in the
Notice of Disagreement in accordance with this Section 2.04, in the form of a
written brief (an "Arbitration Submission"). If an Arbitration Submission is
not timely delivered with respect to a disputed matter by a party, then such
matter shall be deemed to have been resolved against such party. Parent and
Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the
Accounting Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted
to the Accounting Firm within 30 days after the receipt of the Arbitration
Submissions. The Accounting Firm's decision shall be based solely on the
Arbitration Submissions submitted by Parent and Purchaser and their respective
Representatives and not on independent review. The Accounting Firm shall
address only those items in dispute and may not assign a value greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or smaller than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party. In the absence of
manifest error, the resolution of disputed items by the Accounting Firm shall
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable and
upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover
against Parent or Purchaser, as applicable. The costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be borne
equally by Purchaser and Parent.

  

  

(d) Within three Business Days immediately following the date on which the
Notice of Disagreement is required to be delivered in accordance with Section
2.04(b), (i) Purchaser shall pay to Holdings an amount equal to the undisputed
amount of the Post-Closing Payment Amount reflected in the Proposed Post-
Closing Payment Notice, being the amount that is payable by Purchaser
irrespective of the resolution of any dispute, if such amount is a positive
number, or (ii) Holdings shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the
undisputed amount of the Post-Closing Payment Amount reflected in the Proposed
Post-Closing Payment Notice, being the amount that is payable by Holdings
irrespective of the resolution of any dispute, if such amount is a negative
number. If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to Section
2.04(c) is greater than the Closing Payment, then Purchaser shall pay such
excess to Holdings as the Post-Closing Payment Amount. If the Purchase Price
as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.04(c) is less than the Closing
Payment, then Holdings shall pay such shortfall to Purchaser. The amount of
the Post-Closing Payment referred to in the two immediately preceding
sentences shall account for any payments made pursuant to the first sentence
of this Section 2.04(d). If there is a dispute with respect to any portion of
the Post-Closing Payment Amount, then within three Business Days immediately
following the final determination (either through agreement of the parties or
pursuant to Section 2.04(c)) of all such disputed amounts, Purchaser shall
deliver to Holdings, or Holdings shall deliver to Purchaser, as the case may
be, the Post-Closing Payment finally determined to be payable, plus interest
on such amount from the Closing Date at a rate equal to 30-day LIBOR plus 1%.
Any amounts to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.04(d) shall be paid in cash
in immediately available funds via wire transfer to an account designated by
the receiving party.

  

  

2.05 Tax Treatment of Payments. Any payment made with respect to adjustments
made pursuant to Section 2.04 shall be deemed to be, and each of Parent and
Purchaser shall treat such payments as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for
federal, state, local and foreign income tax purposes.

  

  

2.06 Withholding Rights. Purchaser and the Company shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant
to this

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-28-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Article II, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any provision of Federal, state, local or
foreign Tax law. If Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be, so withholds
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Membership Interests in the Company in
respect of which Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

5.02 Casualty Event; Condemnation

  

  

(a) If, prior to the Closing, (i) any assets or properties of the Companies
(other than Excluded Assets) are damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion or
other casualty loss (a

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-55-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

"Casualty Event"), and (A) the cost of restoring such assets or properties to
a condition reasonably comparable to their condition prior to the Casualty
Event plus (B) the amount of lost profits reasonably expected to accrue
beginning sixty (60) days following the Closing Date ("Lost Profits") as a
result of a Casualty Event to the business and operations of the Companies
(net of and after giving effect to any insurance proceeds available to Parent
or any of its Affiliates for such restoration but not insurance proceeds for
Lost Profits), as each such cost or amount is estimated by a qualified firm
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Parent (collectively, the "Restoration
Cost"), is $75,000,000 or less with respect to a single Casualty Event, or
$100,000,000 or less in the aggregate in the case of multiple Casualty Events,
and (ii) the assets or properties of the Companies damaged by such Casualty
Event can reasonably be expected to be repaired or restored prior to the
Closing, then (A) Parent, Holdings and their respective Affiliates shall take
all necessary action to repair or restore, or cause to be repaired or
restored, the assets or properties of the Companies damaged by such Casualty
Event prior to the Closing and (B) there shall be no reduction to the Purchase
Price as a result of such Casualty Event. If the assets or properties of the
Companies damaged by a Casualty Event referred to in Section 5.02(a)(i) cannot
reasonably be expected to be repaired or restored prior to the Closing, then
(1) the amount of the Purchase Price shall be reduced by (x) the Restoration
Cost (without the netting of available insurance proceeds, but including Lost
Profits) minus (y) the amount expended by Parent, Holdings, any of the
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates prior to the Closing relating
to the repair or restoration of the assets or properties of the Companies
damaged by such Casualty Event, which reduction may in no event cause the
Purchase Price reduction at the Closing to be less than the amount required to
be expended after the Closing to complete such repair or restoration plus the
amount of Lost Profits, if any (the "Adjusted Restoration Cost"), (2) Parent,
Holdings and their respective Affiliates shall commence, and until the Closing
shall be fully responsible for, the repair or restoration of the assets or
properties of the Companies damaged by such Casualty Event prior to the
Closing, subject only to the condition that the prime contractor (and the
terms and conditions of the contract) selected by Parent to undertake the
repair or restoration shall be reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, (3) such
Casualty Event shall not affect the Closing and (4) none of Parent, Holdings
or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any obligation with respect
to the repair or restoration of the assets or properties of the Companies
damaged by such Casualty Event after the Closing.

  

  

(b) If the Restoration Cost is greater than $75,000,000 with respect to a
single Casualty Event, or greater than $100,000,000 in the aggregate in the
case of multiple Casualty Events, then Purchaser may, by written notice to
Parent within ten (10) days following the date Purchaser has received written
notice of both such Casualty Event and the Restoration Cost, elect to
terminate this Agreement. If Purchaser fails to provide notice of its election
within such ten (10) day period, then (i) Purchaser shall be deemed to have
elected to have the amount of the Purchase Price reduced by the Adjusted
Restoration Cost, (ii) Parent, Holdings and their respective Affiliates shall
commence, and until the Closing shall be fully responsible for, the repair or
restoration of the assets or properties of the Companies damaged by such
Casualty Event prior to the Closing, subject only to the condition that the
prime contractor (and the terms and conditions of the contract) selected by
Parent to undertake the repair or restoration shall be reasonably satisfactory
to Purchaser, (iii) such Casualty Event shall not affect the Closing and (iv)
none of Parent, Holdings or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any
obligation with respect to the repair or restoration of the assets or
properties of the Companies damaged by such Casualty Event after the Closing.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-56-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall, both prior to and after the Closing,
reasonably cooperate with Parent, Holdings and their respective Affiliates
with respect to any claims they may make under their insurance policies
relating to such Casualty Event, and provide any reasonable assistance
requested by Parent, Holdings or any of their respective Affiliates to assist
such parties in making or pursuing any such claims, including, without
limitation, by providing Parent, Holdings, their respective Affiliates and
representatives of their insurance companies with access (including inspection
rights) to the assets or properties of the Companies damaged by such Casualty
Event that are being repaired or restored, and copies of all contracts,
invoices and other documentation relating to such repair or restoration. Any
insurance proceeds recovered by Purchaser or its Affiliates attributable to a
Casualty Event that resulted in a reduction to the Purchase Price shall be
promptly paid to Parent.

  

  

(d) If the Purchase Price is reduced pursuant to Section 5.02(a) or (b), as
the case may be, and, following the Closing, Purchaser elects not to complete
the repair or restoration of the assets or properties of the Companies damaged
by such Casualty Event and the amount of such Purchase Price reduction exceeds
the fair market value immediately prior to the Casualty Event of the assets or
properties of the Companies damaged by such Casualty Event, then Purchaser
shall promptly pay to Parent the amount of such difference, and if Purchaser
receives any insurance proceeds in respect of such Casualty Event, Purchaser
shall promptly pay such insurance proceeds to Parent.

  

  

(e) If the Purchase Price is reduced pursuant to Section 5.02(a) or (b), as
the case may be, and (i) if the amount of the Purchase Price reduction in
respect of the Restoration Cost (without giving effect to Lost Profits) is
greater than the actual cost to Purchaser of restoration after the Closing by
more than $1,000,000, then Purchaser shall promptly pay such excess to Parent;
and (ii) if the amount of the Purchase Price reduction in respect of the
Restoration Cost (without giving effect to Lost Profits) is less than the
actual cost to Purchaser of restoration after the Closing by more than
$1,000,000, and Parent has received insurance proceeds that exceed the
Purchase Price reduction, then Parent shall promptly pay such excess to
Purchaser. In addition, if Parent has received business interruption insurance
proceeds which relate to the period after Closing and for which Purchaser did
not receive a Purchase Price adjustment at Closing, Parent shall pay such
proceeds to Purchaser.

  

  

(f) If, prior to Closing, any of the assets or properties of the Companies
(other than the Excluded Assets) are taken by condemnation or eminent domain,
and if the condemnation value of such condemned properties (including lost
profits reasonably expected to accrue after the Closing) is $75,000,000 or
less, as such value or amount is estimated by a qualified firm reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser and Parent (the "Condemnation Value"), then the entire
amount of the award will be retained by Parent, and the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the amount of such Condemnation Value and such condemnation or
eminent domain action shall not affect the Closing. If the Condemnation Value
is greater than $75,000,000, then Purchaser may elect, by written notice to
Parent within ten (10) days following the date Purchaser receives written
notice of such condemnation, to terminate this Agreement. If the Condemnation
Value is in excess of $75,000,000 and Purchaser does not so elect to terminate
this Agreement, then Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected to take a
reduction in Purchase Price as set forth above.

to be included in the Disclosure Letter.

sole cost and risk, reasonable access during normal business hours, upon

operations or properties of the Companies, to the Companies' officers,
employees, properties, facilities, books, records, contracts and other assets

compliance and compliance programs relating to all FERC, PJM and NERC rules
and regulations, subject in all cases to reasonable restrictions and

requirements or other limitations on access imposed by applicable Law. Such
Representatives of Purchaser may only observe the operations of the Companies
and may not direct the activities of any Representatives of any of the
Companies or make any decisions relating to the operations of any of the
Companies. Any such access to the properties of any of the Companies shall be

use by up to four Representatives of Purchaser during normal business hours or
otherwise for the purpose of effecting the transition of ownership of the
Companies to Purchaser. If Purchaser requests that the assistance of any
Representatives of any of the Companies after normal business hours, then the
decision to allow such assistance shall be within the sole discretion of the
Companies and Purchaser shall pay to Parent, at the internal billing rate of
Parent, the associated costs of such overtime. If Purchaser requests that any
of the Companies perform contract work on behalf of Purchaser to facilitate
the transition of operations to Purchaser following the Closing, then Parent
and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith regarding the terms and conditions
under which Parent would provide such services and the compensation
arrangement in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

equipment, facilities, hardware or software prior to the Closing shall be
within Parent's reasonable discretion and (i) shall not interfere with the
operations or properties of any of the Companies, (ii) shall be in compliance
with all restrictions and requirements reasonably established by Parent for
safety purposes and (iii) shall be in compliance with all applicable security
requirements and other requirements of Law; provided, however, that in no
event shall Purchaser or any of its Representatives be permitted to connect to
any equipment of any of the Companies prior to the Closing.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.04(a), (i) none of
Parent, Holdings, the Company or any Subsidiary shall be obligated to disclose
to Purchaser or permit Purchaser access to any information that could
reasonably be expected to (A) violate any applicable Law, (B) result in the
loss of attorney-client privilege with respect to such information, (C) result
in a breach of an agreement to which Parent, Holdings, the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party, if Parent, Holdings or the Company have made reasonable
efforts to obtain consent of such other party to the agreement to such
disclosure, or (D) result in the disclosure of any trade secret or
confidential information of third parties, if Parent, Holdings or the Company
have used reasonable efforts to obtain consent of such third party to such

-61-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

resulting from personal injury or property damage incurred or caused by
officers, employees, agents and other Representatives of Purchaser while
present at the properties, facilities or other premises of any of the
Companies, except to the extent that such Losses result from or arise out of
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any of Parent, Holdings or any
of the Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives.

  

  

(d) The provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms, provided that, after the Closing, the
Companies and Purchaser shall have no confidentiality obligation with respect
to the Companies and the businesses of any of the Companies.

  

  

(e) For a period of seven years after the Closing, Parent and Holdings on the
one hand and Purchaser on the other hand shall afford each other, and
Purchaser shall cause the Companies to afford Parent, upon receipt of
reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours, access to all of
the books and records (including, without limitation, all material returns,
statements, forms, declarations, estimates, schedules, notices, notifications,
elections or other documents with respect to Taxes) of the Companies
containing information relating to the period prior to the Closing to the
extent that such access may reasonably be required by the other party in
connection with matters relating to or affected by the operation of the
Companies prior to the Closing Date, which shall include, without limitation,
access as may be required to assist Purchaser in preparing audited financial
statements of the Companies after the Closing. If Parent or Holdings on the
one hand or Purchaser or the Companies on the other hand shall desire to
dispose of any such books and records prior to the expiration of such seven-
year period, then such party shall, prior to such disposition, give the other
party a reasonable opportunity, at the electing party's expense, to segregate
and remove such books and records as the electing party may select.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.04(e), none of
Parent, Holdings or Purchaser shall be obligated to disclose, or cause to be
disclosed, any information to the other party or parties, as applicable, that
could reasonably be expected to (i) violate any applicable Law, (ii) result in
the loss of attorney-client privilege with respect to such information, (iii)
result in a breach of an agreement to which Parent, Holdings, the Company or
Purchaser is a party, if Parent, Holdings, the Company or Purchaser, as
applicable, have made reasonable efforts to obtain consent of such the other
party to the agreement to such disclosure, or (iv) result in the disclosure of
any trade secret or confidential information of third parties, if Parent,
Holdings, the Company or Purchaser, as applicable, have used reasonable
efforts to obtain consent of such third party to such disclosure.

  

  

(f) For a period of thirty-six (36) months after the Closing, Parent and
Holdings shall provide any documents and information then in its possession,
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser
(subject to reimbursement for reasonable costs and expenses), in each case as
may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to assist it in connection with any
internal investigation by Purchaser, or any FERC, PJM or NERC audit,
investigation or other proceeding, that relates to the Companies' compliance
or non-compliance with FERC, PJM or NERC requirements prior to the Closing.

  

  

6.05 Public Statements. During the period from the date of this Agreement
until the Closing, Parent and Purchaser shall not, without the prior written
consent of the other party, issue any press release with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-62-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

and shall provide the other party with the opportunity to review and comment
on any press release, including the initial press releases to be issued by the
parties with respect to their execution and delivery of this Agreement, that
contains a description of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that this obligation shall not prevent Parent, Purchaser or
any of their Affiliates from making any disclosure (a) required by Law, court
order or listing agreement with any national securities exchange or (b) to
rating agencies or lenders or other source of financing to such party.

  

  

6.06 No Solicitation. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
first to occur of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, none of
Parent, Holdings, the Company, their respective Affiliates nor any of their
respective Representatives shall, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate,
encourage (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other
action to facilitate the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers from
any Person relating to, and will not participate in any negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, any
purchase, transfer or other disposition of all or any part of the Membership
Interests, any merger, consolidation, business combination, acquisition,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the sale of all or any part of the
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Excluded
Assets and assets sold in the ordinary course of business).

  

  

6.07 Release of Parent Letters of Credit and Parent Guarantees.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent a full and unconditional release, as
of the Closing, of all of the obligations of Parent and any of its Affiliates
(other than the Companies) with respect to each Parent Letter of Credit, which
release shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent. As
part of Purchaser's commercially reasonable efforts, Purchaser shall offer to
obtain and deliver to the beneficiary of each Parent Letter of Credit a
substitute letter of credit or other form of security acceptable to the
beneficiary in an amount equal to the amount of the Parent Letter of Credit
that it is intended to replace. In the event Purchaser has not, as of the
Closing, obtained and delivered releases with respect to all of the Parent
Letters of Credit in accordance with the preceding sentences (such unreleased
Parent Letters of Credit being referred to as the "Unreleased Parent Letters
of Credit"):

  

  

(i) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a
release as promptly as practicable following the Closing and shall indemnify
and hold harmless each of Parent and its Affiliates (other than the Companies)
from and against any and all Losses incurred by Parent or any of its
Affiliates arising out of or relating to the Unreleased Parent Letters of
Credit (including reimbursing Parent, on a quarterly basis, for the actual
issuing bank's fees incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection
with maintaining all Unreleased Parent Letters of Credit);

  

  

(ii) Purchaser shall not permit the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their
respective Affiliates to (A) renew or extend the term of, (B) increase the
obligations under, or (C) transfer to another third party, any written or oral
contract, loan, agreement, commitment, franchise, indenture, lease, purchase
order, license, other binding

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-63-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

understanding or arrangement or other obligation that is covered by an
Unreleased Parent Letter of Credit;

  

  

(iii) Purchaser shall deliver to Parent at the Closing, and maintain at all
times until the full and unconditional release of all of the Unreleased Parent
Letters of Credit, a Purchaser Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of all Unreleased Parent Letters of Credit; and

  

  

(iv) In no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be required to renew
any Unreleased Parent Letter of Credit following the Closing whether pursuant
to an evergreen provision or otherwise.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent a full and unconditional release, as
of the Closing, of all of the obligations of Parent and any of its Affiliates
(other than the Companies) with respect to each Parent Guarantee, which
release shall in form and substance be reasonably acceptable to Parent. As
part of Purchaser's commercially reasonable efforts, Purchaser shall offer to
obtain and deliver to the beneficiary of each Parent Guarantee a substitute
guarantee or, in Purchaser's sole discretion, other form of security
acceptable to the beneficiary having terms and conditions substantially
similar to the Parent Guarantee that it is intended to replace; provided,
however, that if the beneficiary of such Parent Guarantee does not accept a
substitute guarantee (or other security) and (i) the terms of the Parent
Guarantee or of any Contract requiring such Parent Guarantee to be maintained
permit the replacement of such Parent Guarantee with another form of credit
support, then Purchaser shall offer the beneficiary of such Parent Guarantee
such other form of credit support in order to obtain the release of such
Parent Guarantee or (ii) the terms of the Parent Guarantee or of any Contract
requiring such Parent Guarantee to be maintained do not so permit the
replacement of such Parent Guarantee with another form of credit support, then
Purchaser shall offer to replace such Parent Guarantee with a Purchaser Letter
of Credit or cash in an amount at least equal to the maximum amount of such
Parent Guarantee in order to obtain the release of such Parent Guarantee. In
the event Purchaser has not, as of the Closing, obtained and delivered
releases with respect to all of the Parent Guarantees in accordance with the
preceding sentences (such unreleased Parent Guarantees being referred to as
the "Unreleased Parent Guarantees"):

  

  

(i) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a release as
promptly as practicable following the Closing and shall indemnify and hold
harmless each of Parent and its Affiliates (other than the Companies) from and
against any and all Losses incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates arising
out of or relating to the Unreleased Parent Guarantees;

  

  

(ii) Purchaser shall not permit the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their
respective Affiliates to (A) renew or extend the term of, (B) increase the
obligations under, or (C) transfer to another third party, any written or oral
contract, loan, agreement, commitment, franchise, indenture, lease, purchase
order, license, other binding understanding or arrangement or other obligation
covered by an Unreleased Parent Guarantee; and

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-64-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

(iii) Purchaser shall deliver to Parent at the Closing, and maintain at all
times until the full and unconditional release of all Unreleased Parent
Guarantees, cash or a Purchaser Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the
maximum aggregate amount of all Unreleased Parent Guarantees.

  

  

To the extent that Parent or any of its Affiliates has performance obligations
under any Parent Guarantee as of the Closing, Purchaser shall (i) perform such
obligations on behalf of Parent or its Affiliates if practicable, or (ii)
otherwise take such action as requested by Parent so as to put Parent or its
Affiliates in the same position as if Purchaser, and not Parent or such
Affiliates, had performed or was performing such obligations.

  

  

(c) Parent and Holdings shall provide, and shall cause the Companies and each
of their respective Representatives to provide, upon the reasonable request of
Purchaser, and at Purchaser's sole cost and expense, all cooperation
reasonably necessary and the taking of any actions reasonably requested by
Purchaser in connection with the arrangement of substitute letters of credit
or other form of security as contemplated by this Section 6.07.

  

  

(d) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing,
Parent, Holdings and the Company shall not, and the Company shall cause the
Subsidiaries not to renew or extend the term of, or increase the obligations
under any Parent Letter of Credit or Parent Guarantee, except as provided in
Section 6.07 of the Disclosure Letter, or as required by the terms of the
obligation(s) to which such Parent Letter of Credit or Parent Guarantee
relates.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.07 shall require
Purchaser to obtain a guarantee or other credit support from Calpine
Corporation.

  

  

6.08 Compliance with ISRA.

  

  

(a) With respect to the New Jersey ISRA Property and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall submit or cause to be submitted
to NJDEP (i) within five days after the execution of this Agreement, a General
Information Notice (as such term is defined under ISRA), for each New Jersey
ISRA Property, and (ii) prior to the Closing Date (A) a Remediation
Certification (as such term is defined under ISRA) ("Remediation
Certification"), for each New Jersey ISRA Property, regarding the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) as part of that
Remediation Certification, evidence of the establishment by Purchaser of a
remediation funding source (as such term is defined under ISRA) in an amount
of the estimated cost of the remediation as certified by an LSRP, who is
mutually agreed upon by Parent and Purchaser and engaged by Purchaser, or a
minimum surrogate cost estimate as required by the NJDEP, which remediation
funding source shall be in conformance in form and substance with the
requirements of N.J.A.C. 7:26C-5. The type of remediation funding source, to
be established in accordance with the requirements of N.J.A.C. 7:26C-5.2(f)
and (g), shall be in the discretion of Purchaser. Purchaser shall execute all
Remediation Certifications identifying Purchaser as the party agreeing to
conduct remediation for each of the New Jersey ISRA Properties and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. With respect to any subsequent
transaction by or among Purchaser, Parent, Holdings or any of their respective
Affiliates that will "close operations" or "transfer ownership or operations"
of any of the New Jersey ISRA Property that is also Leased Real Property or

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-65-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Easement Real Property, the party undertaking such transaction shall timely
submit or cause timely to be submitted to NJDEP the General Information Notice
required by ISRA, and all other responsibilities for Compliance with ISRA in
such cases shall be as provided in this Section 6.08.

  

  

(b) Following the Closing, Purchaser shall have complete responsibility for
directing the remediation subject to Section 6.08(d) and (e), and shall assume
all costs and Liabilities associated with, the performance of any Remediation
at the New Jersey ISRA Property necessary to achieve Compliance with ISRA.
Purchaser shall submit all filings and certifications and take all actions
required under the Remediation Certifications and ISRA to achieve Compliance
with ISRA. If any such filings or certifications are required to be submitted
by Parent, then Purchaser shall prepare such filings or certifications and
provide them to Parent for submission.

  

  

(c) Purchaser shall, within five Business Days of sending or receipt thereof,
provide Parent with complete and correct copies of all documents, including
correspondence and final workplans and reports, field and laboratory data,
summaries, proposals and recommendations, prepared by Purchaser or the LSRP or
submitted by Purchaser or the LSRP to, or received by Purchaser or the LSRP
from, the NJDEP in connection with Purchaser's actions to achieve Compliance
with ISRA.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, or
in any lease or easement agreement in respect of any Leased Real Property or
Easement Real Property that is also a New Jersey ISRA Property, (i) Purchaser
shall be responsible for ISRA Compliance Costs in respect of Environmental
Conditions existing on or prior to the Closing Date, up to the Remediation Cap
(and, if advanced by Parent, shall be promptly reimbursed by Purchaser on
request); and (ii) all ISRA Compliance Costs in respect of Environmental
Conditions existing on or prior to the Closing Date in excess of the
Remediation Cap shall be the sole responsibility of Parent and Holdings, on a
joint and several basis, (and, if advanced by Purchaser, shall be promptly
reimbursed by Parent on request). Except to the extent such Losses arise from
or are caused by the post-Closing acts or omissions of Parent or its
Affiliates (or their respective employees, agents, representatives,
consultants, contractors, successors, assigns, invitees or licensees),
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates from and
against any and all Losses incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates arising
out of or relating to (i) achieving prompt and timely Compliance with ISRA in
accordance with the regulatory and mandatory timeframes as specified by ISRA,
SRRA, and the Administrative Requirements for the Remediation of Contaminated
Sites, N.J.A.C. 7:26C-1.1 et seq., and (ii) any failure by Purchaser (or
consultants, contractors or LSRPs retained by Purchaser) to satisfy and comply
with the obligations of this Section 6.08.

  

  

(e) As to any Remediation or other activities that Purchaser undertakes or
performs at or with respect to the New Jersey ISRA Property after Closing
pursuant to this Section 6.08 in order to achieve Compliance with ISRA,
Purchaser shall:

  

  

(i) retain and engage a properly licensed LSRP to assist Purchaser in
achieving Compliance with ISRA, unless the New Jersey ISRA Property under
review, or

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-66-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

any portion thereof, is subject to the regulatory requirements of direct
oversight by the NJDEP;

  

  

(ii) perform, and cause all consultants and contractors (including the LSRP)
retained by Purchaser to perform, all such Remediation in a workmanlike
manner, on a prompt and timely basis, and consistent with all applicable
Environmental Laws;

  

  

(iii) comply with all Environmental Laws applicable to the implementation of
such Remediation at the New Jersey ISRA Property and obtain all permits,
authorizations and consents required under applicable Environmental Laws or by
the NJDEP or the LSRP or other Governmental or Regulatory Authority in order
to implement such Remediation at the New Jersey ISRA Property. Without
limiting or affecting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall satisfy
and comply with, and cause its contractors and consultants (including the
LSRP) to satisfy and comply with, c) all timeframes as established by the
NJDEP pursuant to ISRA, as such timeframes may be extended, and (a) the public
notification requirements set forth at N.J.A.C. 7:26E-1.1 et seq. (as such
requirements may be amended, modified or supplemented after the Closing Date);

  

  

(iv) cause all consultants and contractors (including the LSRP) performing
such Remediation to provide and maintain in full force and effect insurance in
commercially reasonable types and amounts as are customarily maintained by
contractors and consultants for the performance of comparable work or services
until 90 days following the date that Compliance with ISRA has been achieved;

  

  

(v) provide Parent a written project status report, cost estimate, and
accounting, on a semi-annual basis, of all ISRA Compliance Costs incurred for
the New Jersey ISRA Property ("Purchaser's ISRA Status Report") and, if
determined appropriate by Parent in its sole discretion, allow Parent, at its
sole cost and expense, to conduct a financial audit on a semi-annual basis of
ISRA Compliance Costs expended by Purchaser ("Parent's ISRA Compliance Cost
Audit");

  

  

(vi) if and when ISRA Compliance Costs incurred by Purchaser reach $7,000,000
and thereafter until such time as Compliance with ISRA has been achieved by
either Parent or Purchaser for the New Jersey ISRA Property, Purchaser shall
provide Parent with (A) a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
any workplans or reports (including any workplans and reports prepared by the
LSRP) respecting any Remediation and other material submissions to NJDEP prior
to submission and implementation, (B) reasonable advance notice of, and an
opportunity to have a representative present during, the performance of any
Remediation, (C) reasonable advance notice of, and an opportunity to have a
representative present during, any meeting with, or site visit or inspection
by, the LSRP or NJDEP, and (D) Purchaser's ISRA Status Report and the
opportunity to conduct Parent's Compliance Audit, both on a quarterly basis
rather than on a semi-annual basis. For the purposes of this subsection (vi),
ten (10) Business Days (or less if not feasible under the circumstances) shall
be deemed a reasonable opportunity for Parent to review and comment upon
submissions or receive advance notice of a meeting, site visit or inspection);
and

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-67-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

(vii) if and when the ISRA Compliance Costs incurred by Purchaser reach the
Remediation Cap, provide Parent with the opportunity to receive, review and
comment upon any and all Remediation bid proposals of $100,000 or more.

  

  

(f) Purchaser shall promptly execute such documents prepared by Parent or take
such other actions as reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
satisfaction of Purchaser's obligations under this Section 6.08.

  

  

(g) If Purchaser fails to (i) materially satisfy any of its obligations under
this Section 6.08 or (ii) materially comply with the requirements of ISRA or
other applicable Environmental Laws in connection with Purchaser's actions to
achieve Compliance with ISRA, then Parent shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to take such actions, including Remediation, reasonably necessary
in Parent's sole discretion to cure such default, or to achieve Compliance
with ISRA, provided Parent has given at least (30) thirty days prior written
notice to Purchaser and Purchaser has failed to cure such default within such
period. In such event, Purchaser shall remain responsible for ISRA Compliance
Costs up to the Remediation Cap and, in addition, shall be responsible for
Parent's internal administrative costs incurred to achieve Compliance with
ISRA. Further, Purchaser agrees to grant Parent access to the New Jersey ISRA
Properties and consents to Parent's use, sampling and maintenance of equipment
and facilities installed by Purchaser in connection with the performance of
the Remediation with respect to soil or groundwater at the New Jersey ISRA
Property, including groundwater monitoring wells, groundwater treatment
facilities, underground piping, and such other similar facilities, piping and
wells necessary or required in order to monitor, treat or recover groundwater
from beneath or emanating from the New Jersey ISRA Property. In the event
Parent takes on Remediation pursuant to this paragraph, Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that completion of Remediation and the obtaining of a No Further
Action Letter, Remedial Action Outcome or equivalent document may be
conditioned on the implementation of institutional and/or engineering controls
(as defined by the Brownfield and Contaminated Site Remediation Act, N.J.S.A.
58:10B-1 et seq.; Classification Exception Areas (CEAs) for groundwater; and
deed notice(s) and/or Deed Restriction(s) which may include but are not
limited to references to the extent and location of environmental impacts
remaining on the New Jersey ISRA Properties (collectively, "Institutional
Controls")). Parent shall have the right to encumber the New Jersey ISRA
Properties through the use of Institutional Controls to obtain a No Further
Action Letter, Remedial Action Outcome or equivalent document.

  

  

6.09 Reorganization. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement (including the provisions of Article V), prior to the Closing,
Parent and Holdings shall, and Parent and Holdings shall cause the Companies
to, take the actions described in Section 6.09 of the Disclosure Letter
(collectively, the "Reorganization"), at Parent's sole cost and expense;
provided, however, that the obligations of Parent and Holdings under this
Section 6.09 shall not relieve Purchaser of any obligations under Section
6.07. If a third party requires that Purchaser or one of the Companies provide
credit support as a condition to granting its consent or approval to effect
the transfer or assignment of any Contract to any of the Companies as part of
the Reorganization (but only if the right to request such credit support is
expressly included in such Contract), then Purchaser shall, or shall cause one
of the Companies to, as of the Closing, provide such credit support,
including, without limitation, by posting a guarantee, letter of credit, bond,
cash or other credit support required by such third party; otherwise Purchaser

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-68-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

shall not be so obligated. Parent and Holdings shall provide Purchaser a copy
of any third party consents obtained by Parent or Holdings in order to effect
the Reorganization. In the event that any Contract (other than the Columbia
Gas Contract and the Spectra Services Contract) is subject to FERC's capacity
release requirements (unless those requirements have been waived by FERC) and
a third party submits a bid for such Contract, Parent shall provide notice to
Purchaser and Parent shall allow such third party to acquire such Contract and
such Contract shall not be included as part of the Reorganization. If in
connection with any transfer or assignment of a Contract to any of the
Companies in connection with the Reorganization, (i) such Contract is amended
or modified such that the terms of the Contract as amended or modified are
more favorable to the counterparty than the terms of such Contract immediately
prior to such amendment or modification and (ii) at any time following the
Closing Purchaser becomes aware that the products or services obtained under
such Contract become available on terms that are materially more favorable
than under such Contract, then Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to renegotiate or replace such Contract, but at no added cost, expense
or liability to Purchaser.

  

  

6.10 Affiliate Obligations. On or before the Closing Date, except as set forth
on Section 6.10 of the Disclosure Letter, all Liabilities between any of the
Companies on the one hand and Parent, Holdings or any of their Affiliates
(other than any of the Companies) on the other hand, including (a) any and all
Indebtedness and (b) any and all contracts, agreements and instruments (other
than this Agreement and any ancillary agreement relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby) shall be terminated in full, without any Liability for
the Companies following the Closing.

  

  

6.11 Termination or Assignment of Service Contracts. At or prior to the
Closing, Parent, Holdings and the Company shall cause each of the Contracts
listed in Section 6.11 of the Disclosure Letter (the "Service Contracts") to
be terminated or assigned, at Parent's sole cost and expense, such that none
of the Companies shall be responsible for any obligations and Liabilities, or
receive the benefits, under such Service Contracts after the Closing.

  

  

6.12 Transition Services. At the Closing, Purchaser, Parent, Holdings or their
relevant Affiliates shall enter into the Transition Services Agreement. While
the intention of the parties is for Purchaser to complete its ownership
transition prior to the Closing with Parent's reasonable cooperation, during
the period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing, Parent and
Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith regarding the scope and duration of
any transition services that may be provided by Parent or one of its
Affiliates following the Closing to Purchaser and the Companies. The specific
scope and duration of any such transition services that are so agreed to
between Parent and Purchaser shall be included in a schedule to the Transition
Services Agreement as of the Closing.

  

  

6.13 Insurance. Parent shall maintain or cause to be maintained in full force
and effect the material insurance policies covering the business and
operations of the Companies until the Closing or comparable replacement
policies. All such insurance coverage maintained for the benefit of the
Companies by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent (other than policies maintained
by the Companies) shall be terminated as of the Closing; provided, however,
that Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to assign to Purchaser or
one of the Companies the builder's risk policy for the Delta Project.
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for providing

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-69-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

insurance to the business and operations of the Companies for any event or
occurrence that occurs after the Closing.

  

  

6.14 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in Article III, as supplemented by the Disclosure
Letter, none of Parent, Holdings, the Company or any other Person acting on
behalf of Parent, Holdings or the Company makes any representation or
warranty, express or implied, regarding the Company or any Subsidiary. In
entering into this Agreement and acquiring the Membership Interests from
Holdings, Purchaser expressly acknowledges and agrees that it is not relying
on any statement, representation or warranty, including those that may be
contained in any confidential information memorandum or similar materials
containing information regarding Parent, Holdings, the Company or any
Subsidiary or any of their businesses or in any material provided to Purchaser
during the course of its due diligence investigation of Parent, Holdings, the
Company or any Subsidiary, other than those representations and warranties
expressly set forth in Article III, as supplemented by the Disclosure Letter,
and except to the extent any such statements, representations or warranties
constitutes fraud or a willful misrepresentation.

  

  

6.15 Financing Related Cooperation. During the period from the date of this
Agreement until the Closing, Parent and Holdings shall provide, and shall
cause the Companies and each of their respective Representatives to provide,
upon the reasonable request of Purchaser, all cooperation reasonably necessary
in connection with the arrangement of the financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitments, including (a) participation in a reasonable number of
meetings, due diligence sessions, management presentation sessions and
sessions with rating agencies and (b) assisting Purchaser with its preparation
of materials required in connection with the Financing Commitments.

  

  

6.16 Title.

  

  

(a) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cure or remove as
an exception to title, prior to the Closing Date, any Unpermitted Liens and
the Liens set forth in Section 6.16(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(b) Purchaser shall pay the premium for the title policies and endorsements
thereto issued pursuant to the title insurance commitments.

  

  

(c) At the Closing, for any and all Real Property, Parent shall cause to be
delivered to Purchaser's Title Company affidavits and other agreements in the
forms attached hereto as Exhibit F, each as executed by Parent, Holdings or an
Affiliate of Parent (other than one of the Companies), or as otherwise
acceptable to Purchaser's Title Company.

  

  

(d) Parent shall be responsible for maintaining accurate payment records
relating to work provided by contractors for the Delta Project (and for
significant construction projects at the Bethlehem and Edge Moor Generating
Plants), and after the date hereof Parent shall condition any payment to a
contractor holding a contract in excess of $50,000 in the aggregate, on such
contractor executing a lien release in a form to be mutually agreed upon
between Parent and Purchaser or otherwise reasonably acceptable to Purchaser's
Title Insurance Company. Parent shall be responsible for providing to
Purchaser's Title Insurance Company

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-70-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

such evidence of payment and lien releases as such title company may
reasonably request (in combination with such other instruments or credit
assurances from Purchaser) in order to provide insurance against loss arising
from mechanic's and materialman's liens relating to the Delta Project (and for
significant construction projects at the Bethlehem and Edge Moor Generating
Plants) for work performed prior to the Closing, other than work performed in
the 60-day period prior to Closing which, under the terms of the applicable
contractor agreement, was not required to be paid for prior to Closing. In no
event, however, shall Parent be obligated to provide Purchaser's Title
Insurance Company with other than (i) final lien waivers with respect to
contractor agreements for which final payment has been made to such
contractors; (ii) partial lien waivers with respect to outstanding contractor
agreements covering work completed and paid for; and (iii) a copy of the last
available cancelled check evidencing a recent payment to each contractor.

  

  

6.17 Non-Solicitation of Employees. Parent and Holdings shall not, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives not to, from and after
the Closing Date for a period of one (1) year, except as may otherwise be
agreed to by Purchaser, directly or indirectly solicit for employment or hire
or attempt to solicit for employment or hire any employee of the Companies;
provided, however, that this Section 6.17 shall not preclude Parent, Holdings
or their respective Affiliates or Representatives from employing any such
Person who (a) responds to a general solicitation through a public medium or
general or mass mailing by or on behalf of Parent or Holdings or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives that is not targeted at employees of
any of the Companies, or (b) has been terminated by the Companies, as
applicable, prior to being solicited by Parent, Holdings or their Affiliates;
provided further, however, that none of Parent, Holdings or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives shall employ any such employee who
Purchaser notifies Parent in writing is subject to a non-competition
obligation preventing such employee from competing with Purchaser or its
Affiliates.

to this Agreement (including, but not limited to, any Tax resulting from any
election made under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding
elections under state, local or other applicable law) pursuant to Section
8.10) and (B) any other transfer or other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement or any Transaction Document, including, without limitation, any
action taken in connection with or related to the Reorganization; (v) all
other Taxes of Parent, Holdings and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates (other
than the Companies) for any period; (vi) all Liabilities and Taxes imposed on
Purchaser or any of the Companies as a result of (A) N.J. Rev. Stat.
§54:50-38, et seq., together with all regulations, announcements, guidance and
other administrative releases or requirements relating thereto (collectively,
the "Bulk Sale Act") or (B) a failure by Purchaser, any of the Companies or
any other Person to comply in any or all respects with the Bulk Sale Act, in
connection with (1) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any Transaction Document (including, but not limited to, the purchase of the
Membership Interests, and any other sale, transfer or assignment, whether in
connection with the Reorganization or otherwise) or (2) any other transaction
engaged in by any of the Companies occurring on or prior to the Closing Date;
(vii) Recaptured Section 1603 Payments related to any transfer by Parent or
Holdings (other than any Recaptured Section 1603 Payment resulting from
Purchaser's breach of Section 4.11) or action taken by the Parent or Holdings
related to property eligible for the Cash Grant; and (viii) any Tax indemnity
obligation of Conectiv Mid-Merit, LLC pursuant to Article II.H. of the
Interconnect Lateral Agreement with respect to any taxable event occurring in
a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Holdings
shall have no Liability for the payment of any Tax pursuant to this Section
8.02(a) to the extent of Taxes reflected as current liabilities in the
calculation of Closing Date Working Capital or if such Tax is imposed as a
result of Purchaser's breach of any covenant contained in this Article VIII.

  

  

(b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be liable for and shall
indemnify Parent, Holdings and their Affiliates and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, shareholders, agents, successors and assigns
against and hold them harmless from (i) all Liability for Taxes (other than
(A) the Transfer Taxes that are the responsibility of the Parent pursuant to
Section 8.06 and (B) the Taxes described in clauses (iii)-(viii) of Section
8.02(a)) of the Companies attributable to the income, assets or operations of
the Companies for any Post-Closing Tax Period, (ii) any breach by Purchaser
of, or failure by Purchaser to perform, any of its covenants or obligations
contained in this Article VIII; (iii) any Liability for Taxes arising solely
from any actions taken by Purchaser on the Closing Date that are not
contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) any Recapture Section 1603 Payment
related to any transfer by Purchaser, any action taken by the Purchaser
related to property eligible for the Cash Grant, or any breach by Purchaser
with respect to Section 4.11.

  

  

(c) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not begin on)
the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"): (i) real, personal and intangible
property Taxes ("Property Taxes") of any of the Companies for the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall equal the Property Taxes owed by the Company or such
Subsidiary for such Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period; and (ii) Taxes of the Companies, other than Property Taxes,
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if the entire Straddle
Period ended on the day preceding the Closing Date. Parent

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-81-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

shall be liable for Taxes of the Companies that are attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the day preceding the Closing Date,
and shall pay such amounts to Purchaser on or before five (5) days prior to
the due date of such Taxes (except to the extent such amount was taken into
account in calculating Closing Date Working Capital).

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
transaction that occurs outside of the ordinary course of business and is not
contemplated pursuant to this Agreement, and that occurs on the Closing Date,
but prior to the Closing (which for the purpose of this Section 8.02(d) shall
mean the actual time of Closing and not the Closing as deemed to occur at
12:01am on the Closing Date) or after Closing as a result of an action taken
by Parent or any of its Affiliates prior to Closing, shall be deemed for
purposes of this Article VIII as occurring in a Pre-Closing Tax Period. For
the avoidance of doubt, any transaction not contemplated by this Agreement
that occurs on the Closing Date but after the actual time of Closing shall be
deemed to occur for purposes of this Article VIII in a Post-Closing Tax
Period.

  

  

(e) Parent has requested, and Purchaser hereby agrees, that none of Parent,
Purchaser or any of the Companies shall make any filings pursuant to the Bulk
Sale Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the failure of
Purchaser, any of the Companies or any other Person, including Parent and
Holdings, to comply in any respect with any or all obligations imposed by or
under the Bulk Sale Act shall not be treated as a breach or failure to perform
by Purchaser, Parent or Holdings of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or other obligation contained in this Agreement, and shall not in
any way limit or reduce the obligations of Purchaser, Parent and Holdings
pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, the indemnification
obligations of Purchaser, Parent and Holdings pursuant to this Article VIII.

  

  

8.03 Cooperation. Parent, Holdings, the Company and Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives
reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns, including
maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in
connection with Taxes, and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect
to all taxable periods relating to Taxes, including all Tax Claims.

  

  

8.04 Cash Grant, Refunds and Credits. Any Cash Grant or refund or credit of
Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary attributed to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be for the account of Parent (other than any Cash Grant, refund
or credit taken into account as a current asset of any of the Companies in the
calculation of Closing Date Working Capital); provided, however, that Parent
and Holdings shall be required to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant
to Section 8.02 for any Taxes subsequently determined to be owing with respect
to any refund or credit. Any refund or credit of Taxes of any of the Companies
attributed to any Post-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of
Purchaser. Any refund or credit of Taxes of any of the Companies for any
Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Parent and Purchaser
based on the allocation criteria set forth in Section 8.02(c). Each party
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, forward to any other party entitled
under this Section 8.04 to any Cash Grant or refund or credit of Taxes any
such Cash Grant or refund within 15 days after such Cash Grant or refund is
received or reimburse such other party for any such credit within 15 days
after the credit is allowed or applied against another Tax Liability. The
parties shall treat any

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-82-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

payments under this Section 8.04 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. The
control of the prosecution of a claim for refund of Taxes paid pursuant to a
deficiency assessed subsequent to the Closing Date as a result of an audit
shall be governed by the provisions of Section 8.07.

  

  

8.05 Tax Sharing Agreements. Parent shall cause any and all Tax sharing
allocations, indemnifications, or similar agreements in effect, written or
unwritten, between (a) Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Companies) on the one hand, and (b) the Companies on the other hand, to be
terminated on or before the Closing Date for all Taxes imposed by any Taxing
Authority, regardless of the period in which such Taxes are imposed. After the
Closing Date, no party shall have any rights or obligations under any such Tax
sharing agreements.

  

  

8.06 Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent and Purchaser shall share equally in the payment of all
sales, use, transfer, recordation, stamp, conveyance, value added or other
similar Taxes, duties, excises or governmental charges imposed by any Taxing
Authority, domestic or foreign, and all recording or filing fees, notarial
fees and other similar costs of Closing (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") with
respect to the purchase of the Membership Interests by Purchaser; provided,
however, that Parent shall be responsible for all other Transfer Taxes, if
any, in connection with any other transfer or other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Reorganization.

  

  

8.07 Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims.

  

  

(a) If any fact, circumstance, or event shall exist with respect to which any
Purchaser Indemnitee intends to seek an indemnity payment pursuant to Section
8.02(a), Purchaser shall promptly notify Parent in writing within 5 Business
Days of receipt of such fact, circumstance or event (a "Tax Claim"). Failure
to give notice of a Tax Claim to Parent in writing within 5 Business Days of
receipt and in reasonably sufficient detail to allow Parent to effectively
contest such Tax Claim shall affect the Liability of Parent to any Purchaser
Indemnitee only to the extent that Parent's position is materially prejudiced
as a result thereof.

  

  

(b) Parent, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the authority to control
all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating solely to
Taxes of any of the Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and may make all
decisions in connection with such Tax Claim; provided, however, that (i)
Purchaser and counsel of its own choosing shall have the right to participate
fully in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim (at
Purchaser's sole cost and expense), and (ii) Parent shall not settle or
compromise any Tax Claim that could adversely affect Purchaser, the Companies
or any Affiliate of the foregoing without the prior written consent of
Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Parent and Purchaser
shall jointly control all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim
relating solely to Taxes of the Companies for a Straddle Period, and neither
party shall settle any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the
other party (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Purchaser shall
control all proceedings with respect to all other Tax Claims.

  

  

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.07(c), any indemnity
payment to be made under Section 8.02 shall be paid within 30 Business Days
after the

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-83-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

applicable indemnitee makes written demand upon the indemnifying party, but in
no case later than five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which the
relevant Taxes are required to be paid to the relevant Taxing Authority
(including as estimated Tax payments). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
case of a payment relating to an assessment by a Taxing Authority that is
being contested by Parent, Holdings or a Purchaser Indemnitee, any payment to
be made by Parent or Holdings under Section 8.02 with respect to the
assessment shall be paid by Parent or Holdings within 30 Business Days
following the conclusion of the applicable contest unless applicable law
requires such payment to be made by an earlier date. Any request for an
indemnity payment under this Article VIII shall include calculations or other
materials supporting such Liability.

  

  

8.08 Exclusive Remedy and Survival. Except as otherwise specifically provided
in Section 10.03(d), this Article VIII shall exclusively govern any claim for
indemnification with respect to Taxes, including with respect to
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.08. All representations
and warranties of Parent contained in Section 3.08 and all rights and
responsibilities relating to the indemnification of Taxes shall survive for 60
days beyond the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including
extensions thereof).

  

  

8.09 Tax Covenants.

  

  

(a) Parent, Holdings and Purchaser shall treat the purchase of Membership
Interests contemplated by this Agreement as the purchase of all of the assets
of the Company for federal and applicable state and local income Tax purposes
and shall take no position inconsistent with such treatment in any Tax Return,
any proceeding before any Taxing Authority or otherwise unless required by
applicable Law.

  

  

(b) As soon as practicable after the Closing, but in no event more than 120
days after Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to Holdings a statement (the
"Purchase Price Allocation") allocating all amounts constituting consideration
for the Membership Interests to the Company's assets (including the assets of
Subsidiaries treated as disregarded entities) in accordance with Code Section
1060. If within 60 days after the delivery of the Purchase Price Allocation
Holdings notifies Purchaser in writing that Holdings objects to the allocation
set forth in the Purchase Price Allocation, Purchaser and Holdings shall use
reasonable best efforts to resolve such dispute within 20 days. In the event
that Purchaser and Holdings are unable to resolve such dispute within 20 days,
Purchaser and Holdings shall jointly retain the Accounting Firm (which may in
turn select an appraiser if needed) to resolve the disputed item. Upon
resolution of the disputed items, the allocation reflected on the Purchase
Price Allocation shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The costs, fees
and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Purchaser and
Holdings.

  

  

(c) Purchaser, Parent and Holdings agree to act in accordance with the
Purchase Price Allocation (as adjusted, if applicable) in the preparation,
filing and audit of any Tax Return, including IRS Form 8594. Purchaser, Parent
and Holdings agree to cooperate with the others in preparing IRS Form 8594 and
to furnish the other with a copy of such Form prepared in draft form at least
thirty (30) days before its filing due date.

  

  

(d) Parent, Holdings and/or any of the Companies shall not agree to any
settlement or other negotiated resolution relating to the real property tax
Legal Proceedings that

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-84-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

would bind Purchaser to any future assessment, methodology, calculation, or
other stipulated method of determining the assessment by agreement or
precedent, without Purchaser's consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

  

8.10 Section 338(h)(10) Election. At Purchaser's option, Parent and Purchaser
shall join in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any
corresponding elections under state, local, or other applicable tax law) on
Form 8023 or in such other manner as may be required by rule or regulation of
the IRS, with respect to the acquisition of Conectiv Mid Merit, LLC and any
other entity that is treated as a C corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes that is being purchased pursuant to this Agreement. Purchaser will
prepare and file the forms necessary for such election and will provide such
forms to Parent at least sixty (60) days prior to the due date of filing.
Parent shall deliver to Purchaser at least thirty (30) days prior to the due
date of filing such completed forms as are required to be filed under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and analogous provisions of state or local law).
Purchaser and Parent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to agree,
as soon as practicable after Closing but in no event later than one hundred
and twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, on the computation of the
modified aggregate deemed sale price (as defined under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.338-4).

  

  

8.11 Real Property Tax Legal Proceedings. At any time following the date of
this Agreement, Purchaser may request permission (such permission not to be
unreasonably withheld or denied) to commence, in its own name, a real property
tax Legal Proceeding challenging a municipal tax assessment on any property of
the Companies for years 2010 and thereafter ("Real Property Tax Legal
Proceeding"). Parent, Holdings and the Company shall reasonably cooperate, in
making available to Purchaser all records necessary in connection with the
Real Property Tax Legal Proceeding, and Purchaser shall provide to Parent all
documents relating to such Real Property Tax Legal Proceeding for Parent's
approval prior to filing by Purchaser. At the request of Purchaser, Parent,
Holdings and the Company shall commence, or cause the Subsidiaries to
commence, a Real Property Tax Legal Proceeding in the name(s) of Parent,
Holdings, the Company or any Subsidiary, unless Parent or Holdings reasonably
believes that Parent, Holdings or the Company is likely to be adversely
affected as a result of such Real Property Tax Legal Proceeding. Parent,
Holdings and the Company shall have the obligation to consult with Purchaser
before commencing and during any Real Property Tax Legal Proceeding in the
name(s) of Parent, Holdings, the Company or any Subsidiary, and, in the case
of a Real Property Tax Legal Proceeding that is not requested by Purchaser,
shall obtain Purchaser\'s prior written consent to the Real Property Tax Legal
Proceeding, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Parent, Holdings and the
Company's right and obligation to commence a Real Property Tax Legal
Proceeding shall cease upon Closing. Parent, Holdings, and the Company shall
also promptly provide Purchaser with all real estate assessments and notices
received after the date of this Agreement with respect to real property owned
by the Companies.

ARTICLE IX

  

  

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

  

  

9.01 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Employment of Non-Union Employees.

  

  

(i) During the 30-day period following the date of this Agreement, Parent
shall (or Parent shall cause the applicable Parent Employer Party to), upon
reasonable notice and to the extent not disruptive to the business and
operations of the applicable Parent Employer Party, provide Purchaser with
reasonable access to each Non-Union Employee for the purpose of enabling
Purchaser to determine whether it wishes to make a post-Closing offer of
employment to such Non-Union Employee. No later than fifteen (15) days
following the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall provide Parent with any
requests for personnel records of Non-Union Employees, and, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law without the consent of such employee, Parent shall
(or Parent shall cause the applicable Parent Employer Party to) provide
Purchaser such Non-Union Employee's personnel records no later than fifteen
(15) days following receipt by Parent of such request; provided, however, that
if Parent receives such request prior to the date of this Agreement, then
Parent shall (or Parent shall cause the applicable Parent Employer Party to)
provide such personnel records no later than the later of (A) fifteen (15)
days following receipt by Parent of such request and (B) ten (10) days
following the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(ii) Within forty (40) days following the date of receipt by Purchaser of
substantially all of the access and records described in Section 9.01(a)(i),
Purchaser shall (a) make offers of employment to those Company Non-Union
Employees that Purchaser elects to retain as an employee following the Closing
(such offers shall be in compliance with the provisions of Section 9.01(b) and
shall be effective as of the Closing Date) and (b) notify Parent as to the
identity of those Company Non-Union Employees that Purchaser does not elect to
retain as an employee of the Companies following the Closing. Prior to the
Closing Date, Parent shall (or cause the Companies to) terminate or transfer
to a Parent Employer Party other than any one of the Companies the employment
of each Company Non-Union Employee so designated by Purchaser as well as each
Company Non-Union Employee that does not accept Purchaser's offer of
employment. Parent shall be responsible for any and all severance or other
post-termination benefits due each such terminated or transferred Company Non-
Union Employees (including, but not limited to, pursuant to the WARN Act and
any applicable state and local Laws and regulations), and Purchaser shall have
no Liability with respect to such terminated or transferred Company Non-Union
Employees, or to any Company Non-Union Employee that declines Purchaser's
offer of employment.

  

  

(iii) Within forty (40) days following the date of receipt by Purchaser of
substantially all of the access and records described in Section 9.01(a)(i),
Purchaser shall notify Parent as to the identity of those Service Company
Employees the services of which Purchaser wishes to retain following the
Closing and Purchaser shall make offers

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-86-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

of employment to such Service Company Employees (such offers shall be in
compliance with the provisions of Section 9.01(b) and shall be effective as of
the Closing Date).

  

  

(b) Obligations with respect to Post-Closing Non-Union Employees.

  

  

(i) In General. During the two-year period beginning on the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, provide to each Post-Closing
Non-Union Employee:

  

  

(A) an annual base salary that is not less that the annual base salary of the
Post-Closing Non-Union Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date;

  

  

(B) bonus and other short-term and long-term incentive opportunities
substantially equivalent to the Post-Closing Non-Union Employee's bonus and
other incentive opportunities under the Benefit Plans for the most recent
calendar year ending prior to the Closing Date (excluding any stock-based
compensation);

  

  

(C) severance benefits substantially equivalent in the aggregate to those
specified in paragraph (ii);

  

  

(D) health, dental, life, disability benefits, vacation leave, and any other
welfare benefits, in each case substantially equivalent in the aggregate to
such benefits in effect under the Benefit Plans immediately prior to the
Closing Date (excluding any retiree welfare benefits);

  

  

(E) compensation with substantially equivalent value (as determined on an
after-tax basis, meaning that the value of tax deferral is taken into account
based on a reasonable tax rate, reflecting the applicable employee's marginal
federal, state and FICA tax rate) in the aggregate to the Assumed Post-Closing
Non-Union Pension Benefits for such employee, which benefits, for the
avoidance of doubt, may be provided in whatever form Purchaser, at its
discretion, selects, including, without limitation, cash, stock or other
comparable benefits, and may be subject to vesting in accordance with criteria
similar to the criteria in the Parent Retirement Plan; provided, however, that
such benefits are in addition to any other benefits required under this
Section 9.01; and

  

  

(F) compensation with substantially equivalent value (as determined on an
after-tax basis, meaning that the value of the exclusion of taxation, if any,
is taken into account based on a reasonable tax rate, reflecting the
applicable employee's marginal federal, state and FICA tax rate) in the
aggregate to the Assumed Post-Closing Non-Union Retiree Welfare Benefits,
which benefits may be provided in whatever form Purchaser, at its discretion
selects, including, without limitation, cash, stock or other comparable
benefits, and may be subject to vesting in accordance with criteria similar to
the criteria in Parents' retiree welfare benefit plan; provided, however, that
such benefits are in addition to any other benefits required under this
Section 9.01.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-87-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

In respect of the foregoing benefits, Purchaser may use different providers,
establish its own benefit plans or use its existing plans.

  

  

(ii) Severance Benefits. Purchaser shall provide severance benefits
substantially equivalent to those set forth in Section 9.01(b)(ii) of the
Disclosure Letter to any Post-Closing Non-Union Employee if, within the two-
year period immediately following the Closing Date, (A) the employment of the
Post-Closing Non-Union Employee is terminated by the Companies, other than for
"cause" (as defined in Section 9.01(b)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter), (B) the
Post-Closing Non-Union Employee terminates his or her employment by the
Companies for good reason (as defined in Section 9.01(b)(ii) of the Disclosure
Letter), or (C) the office or workplace location of the Post-Closing Non-Union
Employee is relocated such that it is not within a fifty (50) mile radius of
the Post-Closing Non-Union Employee's office or workplace location immediately
prior to the Closing Date. Nothing in this Agreement shall alter the at-will
employment status of any Non-Union Employee.

  

  

(iii) Service Credit; Health Plan Provisions. Purchaser and its benefit plans
shall recognize each Post-Closing Non-Union Employee's service with the
applicable Parent Employer Party for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit
accrual, and benefit calculation in any benefit plan, program, or fringe
benefit arrangement, except that no duplication of benefits is required and
excluding the Calpine Employee Service Recognition Program, which provides for
nominal milestone anniversaries awards. For purposes of healthcare coverage,
Purchaser shall waive all limitations regarding pre-existing condition
exclusions, actively at work exclusions and waiting periods for Post-Closing
Non-Union Employees. During the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, all
healthcare expenses incurred by Post-Closing Non-Union Employees that were
qualified to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying any deductible
or out-of-pocket limit under a Parent Employer Party's health care plans shall
be taken into account for purposes of satisfying any deductible or out-of-
pocket limit under Purchaser's health care plans for such calendar year. For
the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall give all Post-Closing Non-Union
Employees full credit for all vacation, sick leave or comp time benefits
accrued and not used as of the Closing Date, to the extent included in the
Closing Date Working Capital as a current liability.

  

  

(iv) 401(k) Plan. As soon as practicable, and in any event within forty-five
(45) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish or designate a
defined contribution pension plan (or plans) and trust (or trusts) intended to
qualify under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code (such plan or plans
referred to as "Purchaser's Savings Plan") in which all Post-Closing Non-Union
Employees shall be eligible to participate as of the later of the Closing Date
or the effective date of Purchaser's Savings Plan. Purchaser's Savings Plan
shall provide for deferral options and employer matching contributions with
respect to the Post-Closing Non-Union Employees that are no less favorable
than those provided immediately prior to the Closing Date to the Post-Closing
Non-Union Employees under the Parent Savings Plan (including an opportunity to
make up for any lost deferrals that were unavailable because of a delay
between the Closing Date and the effective date of Purchaser's Savings Plan,
provided that such opportunity

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-88-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

does not cause Purchaser's Savings Plan to fail to satisfy the safe harbor
requirements under Section 401(k)(12) or Section 401(k)(13) of the Code).
Contributions to the Parent Savings Plan with respect to the Post-Closing Non-
Union Employees shall cease effective as of the Closing Date. Each Post-
Closing Non-Union Employee shall be afforded the option of rolling over his or
her account balance (if any) under the Parent Savings Plan into the
Purchaser's Savings Plan, including any outstanding loan balances attributable
to such accounts. Any such rollovers may be in the form of cash or other
property, as Parent and Purchaser shall mutually agree prior to such rollover
(which Purchaser agrees shall include promissory notes evidencing loans from
the Parent Savings Plan to Post-Closing Non-Union Employees that are
outstanding on the Closing Date). Prior to such rollover, Purchaser will
provide Parent with such documents and other information as Parent shall
reasonably request to assure itself that Purchaser's Savings Plan and the
trust or trusts established pursuant thereto (i) provide for voluntary
participant after-tax contributions and (ii) contain participant loan
provisions and procedures necessary to effect the orderly transfer of
participant loan balances associated with the rollover. Notwithstanding
anything in this Article IX to the contrary, no such rollover shall take place
unless and until Parent has received written evidence of the adoption of
Purchaser's Savings Plan and the trust (or trusts) thereunder by Purchaser and
either (A) a copy of a favorable determination letter or opinion letter issued
by the IRS and satisfactory to Parent's counsel with respect to Purchaser's
Savings Plan or (B) an opinion, satisfactory to Parent's counsel, of
Purchaser's counsel to the effect that the terms of Purchaser's Savings Plan
and its related trust or trusts qualify in form under Sections 401(a) and
501(a) of the Code. Purchaser and Parent shall provide each other with such
records and information as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out their
obligations under this Section 9.01(b) for the purposes of administration of
Purchaser's Savings Plan.

  

  

(v) Service Company Employee. Parent shall be responsible for any and all
Liabilities (including, but not limited to, severance and post-termination
benefits and/or notice pursuant to the WARN Act and applicable state and local
law and regulations) for each Service Company Employee who is not transferred
or assigned to any one of the Companies as of the Closing Date as contemplated
by Section 9.01(a).

  

  

(c) Employment of Union Employees.

  

  

(i) Immediately following the Closing, each Union Employee shall continue to
be employed by one of the Companies under the terms of the applicable
Collective Bargaining Agreement. During the 30-day period following the date
of this Agreement, Parent shall (or Parent shall cause the applicable Parent
Employer Party to), upon reasonable notice and to the extent not disruptive to
the business and operations of the applicable Parent Employer Party, provide
Purchaser with reasonable access, to the extent permitted by applicable Law
and the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement without the consent of such
employee, to such Union Employee's personnel records.

  

  

(ii) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have in effect defined
benefit pension plans ("Purchaser's Union Pension Plans") intended to be
qualified pursuant to Section 401(a) of the Code, providing benefits as of the
Closing

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-89-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Date identical in all material respects (except for such changes as may be
required by law) to the benefits provided to such Union Employees under the
Parent Retirement Plan as of the Closing Date.

  

  

(iii) Union Employees participating in the Parent Retirement Plan immediately
prior to the Closing Date shall become participants in Purchaser\'s Union
Pension Plans as of the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of
Section 9.01(c), such Union Employees shall receive credit for all
compensation and service with Parent, Holdings, the Company or a Subsidiary,
as applicable, (subject to the terms of the Parent Retirement Plan) for
purposes of eligibility for participation, vesting, eligibility for early
retirement and early retirement subsidies and benefit accrual under
Purchaser\'s Union Pension Plans. Parent shall be responsible for Union
Employees' pension benefits accrued up to the Closing Date, and Purchaser
shall be responsible for pension benefits accrued by Union Employees on and
after the Closing Date as provided herein. For the avoidance of doubt,
Purchaser's Union Pensions shall provide each Union Employee early retirement
subsidies with respect to benefits accrued under the Parent Retirement Plan
before the Closing Date, except to the extent that the Union Employee was
eligible for early retirement subsidies before the Closing Date. Purchaser may
offset against the accrued benefits determined under Purchaser's Union Pension
Plans the accrued benefits determined under the Parent Retirement Plan. Parent
shall make pension distributions to Union Employees of the vested portion of
their accrued benefits in accordance with the terms of the Parent Retirement
Plan as in effect from time to time. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, Parent shall provide Purchaser a list showing, as
of the Closing Date, the accrued benefit of each Union Employee under the
Parent Retirement Plan.

  

  

(iv) Parent, and not Purchaser, shall be responsible for retiree welfare
benefits for each Union Employee, and Parent shall indemnify Purchaser with
respect to such benefits up to the level in effect on the Closing Date, as
described in this Section 9.01(c)(iv):

  

  

(A) Parent shall attempt in good faith to enter into an agreement with each
union representing Union Employees that (1) Parent shall provide after the
Closing Date retiree welfare benefits to each Union Employee represented by
such union at the same level as Parent provides its employees represented by
such union at the time the Union Employee retires, and (2) neither Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible for any retiree welfare
benefits for Union Employees represented by such union.

  

  

(B) If Parent enters into an agreement with any union as described in clause
(A) above, Parent shall provide all retiree welfare benefits to Union
Employees represented by each such union. However, if Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates enters into an agreement with any such union to provide additional
or enhanced retiree welfare benefits to Union Employees represented by such
union beyond the level required under the Collective Bargaining Agreement with
such union that Purchaser inherits, Purchaser and not Parent shall provide
such additional or enhanced benefits.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-90-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

(C) If Parent does not enter into an agreement with any union as described in
clause (A) above, (1) Purchaser will make good faith efforts to negotiate,
with each union, retiree welfare benefits for Union Employees at the same
level as Parent provides its employees represented by such union at the time
the Union Employee retires, and (2) Parent shall provide to Union Employees
represented by such union whatever level of retiree welfare benefits is agreed
between Purchaser and such union, but not to exceed the level of retiree
welfare benefits in effect on the Closing Date. If Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates enters into an agreement with any such union to provide additional
or enhanced retiree welfare benefits to Union Employees represented by the
union beyond the level of retiree welfare benefits in effect on the Closing
Date, Purchaser and not Parent shall provide such additional or enhanced
benefits beyond the level of retiree welfare benefits in effect on the Closing
Date.

  

  

(D) For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall provide retiree welfare benefits
to a Union Employee only if the Union Employee satisfies the eligibility
criteria for such benefits. For this purpose, the Union Employee's service
with Purchaser and its Affiliates will be taken into account and combined with
years of service with Parent to determine eligibility for this benefit at the
time of retirement, and the Union Employee must retire from Parent and
Purchaser (including its Affiliates) at the same time.

  

  

(E) In order for Parent to provide retiree welfare benefits pursuant this
Section 9.01(c)(iv), Purchaser agrees to provide to Parent by each February 15
sufficient personnel data (including pensionable earnings) for FAS 87 and FAS
106 (or any successor thereto) actuarial valuation purposes (as reasonably
determined by Parent) for the preceding year for each Union Employee until the
year after the Union Employee retires. Parent shall not be required to provide
retiree welfare benefits with respect to any Union Employee for which such
data is not provided; provided, however, that Parent will notify Purchaser if
it claims that there has been any failure by Purchaser to provide the required
data and Purchaser will have a reasonable opportunity to cure any such
failure.

  

  

(v) 401(k) Plan. As soon as practicable, and in any event within forty-five
(45) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish or designate a
defined contribution pension plan (or plans) and trust (or trusts) intended to
qualify under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code (such plan or plans
referred to as "Purchaser's Union Savings Plan") in which Union Employees who
are employed by the Companies immediately after the Closing Date shall be
eligible to participate as of the later of the Closing Date or the effective
date of Purchaser's Savings Plan. Each such Union Employee shall be afforded
the option of rolling over his or her account balance (if any) under the
Parent Savings Plan into the Purchaser's Union Savings Plan, including any
outstanding loan balances attributable to such accounts. Any such rollovers
may be in the form of cash or other property, as Parent and Purchaser shall
mutually agree prior to such rollover (which Purchaser agrees shall include
promissory notes evidencing loans from the Parent Savings Plan to such Union
Employees that are outstanding on the

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-91-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Closing Date). Prior to such rollover, Purchaser will provide Parent with such
documents and other information as Parent shall reasonably request to assure
itself that Purchaser's Union Savings Plan and the trust or trusts established
pursuant thereto (i) provide for voluntary participant after-tax contributions
and (ii) contain participant loan provisions and procedures necessary to
effect the orderly transfer of participant loan balances associated with the
rollover. Notwithstanding anything in this Article IX to the contrary, no such
rollover shall take place unless and until Parent has received written
evidence of the adoption of Purchaser's Union Savings Plan and the trust (or
trusts) thereunder by Purchaser and either (A) a copy of a favorable
determination letter or opinion letter issued by the IRS and satisfactory to
Parent's counsel with respect to Purchaser's Union Savings Plan or (B) an
opinion, satisfactory to Parent's counsel, of Purchaser's counsel to the
effect that the terms of Purchaser's Union Savings Plan and its related trust
or trusts qualify in form under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code.
Purchaser and Parent shall provide each other with such records and
information as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out their obligations
under this Section 9.01(c)(v) for the purposes of administration of
Purchaser's Union Savings Plan.

  

  

9.02 COBRA. Purchaser shall provide notice of, and the opportunity to
purchase, continuation coverage as required by COBRA to any dependent or
former dependent of a Post-Closing Non-Union Employee or Union Employee who
incurs a "qualifying event" (as such term is defined in COBRA) on or after the
Closing Date.

  

  

9.03 WARN Act. Purchaser shall be responsible, with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, for satisfying all requirements
of the WARN Act and any applicable state and local Laws and regulations for
the notification of its employees of any "employment loss" within the meaning
of the WARN Act (or such similar term under any applicable state or local laws
and regulations) that occurs following the Closing Date. However, Parent will
be responsible for satisfying all requirements of the WARN Act and any
applicable state and local Laws and regulations for the notification of any
"employment loss" within the meaning of the WARN Act (or such similar term
under any applicable state or local laws and regulations) required to be given
to any Non-Union Employees who do not become or remain employees of Purchaser
as of the Closing Date or any Union Employee who terminated prior to the
Closing Date.

  

  

9.04 Employee Liabilities. Except as otherwise provided in this Article IX,
Parent and its Affiliates (other than the Companies) shall retain all
Liabilities for claims of employees and former employees of the Companies (and
their spouses and dependents) under the Benefit Plans other than Benefit Plans
maintained or sponsored by any of the Companies, whether such claims are
incurred or made before, on or after the Closing Date. Parent and its
Affiliates (other than the Companies) shall be solely responsible for paying
and providing long-term disability and life insurance benefits with respect to
any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries (and any individual formerly
employed by the Company or any such Subsidiary) who is receiving long-term
disability benefits as of the Closing Date until the obligation to pay such
benefits first terminates. Parent shall take such action as is necessary to
provide that all Non-Union Employees and Union Employees who are employed by
any of the Companies following the Closing, who are participants in the Parent
Retirement Plan and have a fully vested and non-forfeitable right to their
respective accrued benefits under such Parent Retirement Plan

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-92-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

as of the Closing Date (regardless of their respective years of vesting credit
under the Parent Retirement Plan).

  

  

9.05 No Transfer of Benefit Plans. (a) Purchaser or its Affiliates shall not
be obligated to assume, continue or maintain any of the Benefit Plans (except
as otherwise provided in this Article IX); (b) no assets or Liabilities of any
Benefit Plans shall be transferred to, or assumed by, Purchaser or its
Affiliates or their respective benefit plans; and (c) Parent shall be solely
responsible for funding and/or paying any benefits under any of the Benefit
Plans other than Benefit Plans maintained or sponsored by any of the
Companies, including any termination benefits and other employee entitlements
accrued under such plans by or attributable to employees of any of Parent and
the Parent Employer Parties.

  

  

9.06 No Additional Rights. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
shall: (a) be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Benefit
Plan or any employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement of
Purchaser or its Affiliates, (b) confer upon any employee of Parent, any
Parent Employer Party or the Company or any Subsidiary, or any representative
of any such employee, any rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any period or terms of employment, for
any nature whatsoever, or (c) be interpreted to prevent or restrict Purchaser
or its Affiliates from modifying or terminating the employment or terms of
employment of any Post-Closing Non-Union Employee or any Union Employee
(subject to any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement), including the
amendment or termination of any employee benefit or compensation plan, program
or arrangement, after the Closing Date.

Parent, Holdings and their respective Affiliates against Purchaser and its
Affiliates and Representatives, on the other hand, for any breach of
representation or warranty or breach of any covenant or agreement contained in

(other than with respect to the Specified Representations), all qualifications
of Material Adverse Effect and materially adverse to the Companies as a whole
shall be disregarded; (B) for purposes of determining whether any such breach
by Parent, Holdings or the Company of the Specified Representations has
occurred, all qualifications of materiality, material, materially adverse,
Material Adverse Effect and similar qualifications or standards shall be
disregarded; and (C) after it has been determined that any such breach of

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

  

  

(i) in no event shall Parent and Holdings, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on
the other hand, be liable under Section 10.03(a)(i) or Section 10.03(b)(i) of
this Agreement, as the case may be, for an amount that exceeds Three Hundred
and Twenty million Dollars ($320,000,000) (the "Cap"); provided, however, that
(A) indemnification with respect to the representations and warranties in
Section 3.01 (Organization and Qualification), Section 3.02 (Authority to
Execute and Perform Agreement), Section 3.03 (Capitalization and Title to
Membership Interests), Section 3.04 (Subsidiaries), Section 3.10 (No Breach),

sentence of Section 3.23 (Personal Property), Section 4.01 (Organization and

Section 4.10 (Brokerage) (collectively, the "Specified Representations"), and
(B) indemnification based upon or arising out of fraud, bad faith or willful
misconduct, shall not be subject to the Cap; and

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-98-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

(ii) in no event shall Parent and Holdings, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on
the other hand, be liable under Section 10.03(a)(i) or Section 10.03(b)(i) of
this Agreement, as the case may be, unless and until the Indemnified Parties
thereunder have suffered, incurred, sustained or become subject to Losses
referred to in such Section in excess of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) in
the aggregate (the "Deductible"), and then only to the extent of any such
excess (subject to the Cap, if applicable); provided, however, that (A)
indemnification with respect to the Specified Representations and Section 3.24
(Emission Allowances) and (B) indemnification based upon or arising out of
fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct, shall not be subject to the
Deductible.

  

  

(d) To the extent permissible by Law, any indemnity payment under this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, such a payment under Article
VIII) shall be deemed to be, and each of Parent and Purchaser shall treat such
payments as, an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and
foreign income tax purposes.

  

  

(e) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party under this
Agreement, the amount of any indemnifiable Losses shall be determined without
duplication of any other indemnifiable Loss for which an indemnification claim
has been made under any other covenant, agreement, representation or warranty.
The amount of any indemnifiable Loss shall be reduced to the extent that the
Indemnified Party receives any insurance proceeds or other payment with
respect to an indemnifiable Loss from an unaffiliated party.

  

  

(f) In addition to the other limitations set forth in this Article X, with
respect to any claim for indemnification regarding any breach of any
representation and warranty set forth in Section 3.20 (Environmental Matters),
to the extent applicable, Parent's and Holdings' indemnification obligations
shall be limited to the cost of the least restrictive standard or remedy
acceptable under applicable Environmental Law (including engineering or
institutional controls) based on the industrial use of the relevant facility
or property; provided, however, that if any contamination at any real property
that is subject to indemnity by Parent and Holdings is exacerbated due to the
negligence, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Purchaser, the Company,
any Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates after the Closing Date,
to the extent such exacerbation increases the cost of the investigation or
remediation of such contamination, Parent and Holdings shall not be
responsible for any such increase in costs.

  

  

(g) Purchaser, on the one hand, and Parent and Holdings, on the other hand,
for themselves and their Affiliates and on behalf of their respective
successors and assigns, do hereby irrevocably release, hold harmless and
forever discharge each other and their respective Affiliates from any and all
Environmental Claims resulting from or arising out of or in connection with
any Environmental Condition or Hazardous Substances or Environmental Law, in
each case as applicable to the Real Property, the Generating Plants or (to the
extent attributable to the business or operations of the Companies) any Off-
Site Location, other than claims arising from the indemnification obligations
set forth in this Section 10.03 and claims based on fraud, bad faith or
willful misconduct (collectively, "Released Environmental Claims"). In
furtherance of, but subject to, the foregoing, Purchaser, on the one hand, and
Parent and Holdings, on the other hand, for themselves and their Affiliates
and on behalf of their respective successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably
waive any and all rights and benefits with respect to such Environmental
Claims that they now have, or in the future may have conferred upon them

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-99-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

by virtue of any applicable Law or common law principle which provides that a
general release does not extend to claims which a party does not know or
suspect to exist in its favor at the time of executing the release, if
knowledge of such claims would have materially affected such party's
settlement with the obligor. In this connection, Purchaser, Parent and
Holdings each hereby acknowledge that they are aware that factual matters now
unknown to them or any of their respective Affiliates may have given, or
hereafter may give, rise to Released Environmental Claims that have not been
made prior to the date of this Agreement, and will not be made prior to the
Closing Date, and Purchaser, on the one hand, and Parent and Holdings, on the
other hand further agree that this release set forth in this Section 10.03(g)
has been negotiated and agreed upon in light of that awareness, and Purchaser,
on the one hand, and Parent and Holdings, on the other hand, for themselves
and their Affiliates and on behalf of their respective successors and assigns,
nevertheless hereby intends irrevocably to release, hold harmless and forever
discharge each other and their respective Affiliates from all such
Environmental Claims.

  

  

(h) The right to indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedy based upon
breach of representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations
will not be affected by any investigation conducted by Purchaser with respect
to, or knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether
before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing
Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance by Parent or
Holdings with any such representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation.

  

  

10.04 Method of Asserting Claims. All claims for indemnification by any
Indemnified Party under Section 10.03 will be asserted and resolved as
follows:

  

  

(a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an Indemnifying Party
might seek indemnity under Section 10.03(a) or 10.03(b) is asserted against or
sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than
Parent, Holdings, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates (a "Third
Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with
reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent (and only to the
extent) that such failure shall have caused the damages for which the
Indemnifying Party is obligated to be greater than such damages would have
been had the Indemnified Party given the Indemnifying Party prompt notice
hereunder. The Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party as soon as
practicable within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes
its liability to the Indemnified Party under Section 10.03(a) or 10.03(b) or
whether the Indemnifying Party desires, at its sole cost and expense, to
defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim.

  

  

(i) If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges its indemnity obligation in writing
and notifies the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that the
Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified Party with respect to the
Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 10.04(a), then the Indemnifying
Party will have the right to defend, with counsel selected by the Indemnifying
Party who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party and at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, such Third Party Claim by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and diligently
prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion; provided, however,
that the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-100-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) before entering into any settlement of a claim or
ceasing to defend such claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will have full control of such
defense and proceedings, including (except as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence) any settlement thereof; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party may, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnified Party,
at any time prior to the Indemnifying Party's delivery of the notice referred
to in the first sentence of this clause (i), file any motion, answer or other
pleadings or take any other action that the Indemnified Party reasonably
believes to be necessary or appropriate to protect its interests and not
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party; provided further, that the Indemnified
Party may participate, at its own cost and expense (except as otherwise
provided in the final sentence of this clause (i)), in the defense of such
Third Party Claim; and provided further, that if requested by the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnified Party will, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in
contesting any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to
contest, or, if appropriate and related to the Third Party Claim in question,
in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third Party Claim,
or any cross-complaint against any Person (other than the Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates). The Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate
in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party if (A) so requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (B) the
Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after seeking the advice of counsel
to the Indemnified Party, that a conflict or potential conflict exists between
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate
representation advisable.

  

  

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party fails to acknowledge its indemnity obligation
in writing or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period
that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Third Party Claim pursuant
to this Section 10.04(a), or if the Indemnifying Party gives such notice but
fails to prosecute vigorously and diligently or settle the Third Party Claim,
or if the Indemnifying Party fails to respond to the Claim Notice within the
Dispute Period, then the Indemnified Party will have the right to defend, at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third Party Claim by
all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and
diligently prosecuted by the Indemnified Party to a final conclusion or, with
the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), may be settled by the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnified Party defends any Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying
Party shall be required to reimburse the Indemnified Party for the reasonable
costs and expenses of defending such Third Party Claim within 30 Business Days
after the date of receipt of any invoice that sets forth in reasonable detail
the costs and expenses incurred. The Indemnified Party will have full control
of such defense and proceedings, including (except as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence) any settlement thereof but shall not thereby
waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
however, that if requested by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party
will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, cooperate with
the Indemnified Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim
which the Indemnified Party is contesting, or, if

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-101-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

appropriate and related to the Third Party Claim in question, in making any
counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third Party Claim, or any cross-
complaint against any Person (other than the Indemnifying Party or any of its
Affiliates). The Indemnifying Party may participate in any defense controlled
by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this clause (ii) at its own cost and
expense.

  

  

(b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim under Section
10.03(a) or 10.03(b) against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice to
the Indemnifying Party with reasonable promptness following its determination
that it has such a claim. The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified
Party within the Dispute Period if the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article X. If the Indemnifying
Party does not so notify the Indemnified Party, the claim specified by the
Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed to be a
liability of the Indemnifying Party under this Article X, and the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on
demand, or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any
portion of the claim) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such
claim (or such portion of the claim) becomes finally determined.

  

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party
under this Article X, then the Indemnified Party shall be free to seek
enforcement of its rights to indemnification under this Agreement.

  

  

10.05 Manner of Payment. Any indemnification of a Purchaser Indemnified Party
pursuant to Section 10.03(a) shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately
available funds from Parent to an account designated by such Purchaser
Indemnified Party within 15 days after the determination thereof. Any
indemnification of a Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 10.03(b)
shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds from
Purchaser to an account designated by such Seller Indemnified Party within 15
days after the determination thereof.

  

  

ARTICLE XI

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

11.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing, and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Holdings, the Company and Purchaser;

  

  

(b) by either Parent or Purchaser, upon written notice given to the other
party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before December 31, 2010
(the "Outside Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.01(b) shall not be available to any
party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been
the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
the Outside Date;

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-102-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) by either Parent or Purchaser, if any Order issued by a court of competent
jurisdiction or by a Governmental or Regulatory Authority, or Law or other
legal restraint or prohibition in each case making the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement illegal or permanently restraining, enjoining
or otherwise preventing the consummation thereof shall be in effect and shall
have become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that the right to
terminate pursuant to this Section 11.01(c) shall not be available if the
issuance of such legal restraint or prohibition was primarily due to the
failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

  

  

(d) by Purchaser upon written notice given to Parent (provided that Purchaser
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein), if there has been a material violation or
breach by Parent, Holdings or the Company of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement which would prevent
the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Purchaser at the
Closing, and such violation or breach has not been waived by Purchaser or
cured by Parent, Holdings or the Company within 45 days after written notice
thereof from Purchaser; provided, however, that there shall be no cure period
if such violation or breach by Parent, Holdings or the Company is such party's
willful and intentional refusal to effect the Closing in breach of this
Agreement following the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII of this Agreement (other
than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied as of the Closing);

  

  

(e) by Parent upon written notice given to Purchaser (provided that none of
Parent, Holdings or the Company is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if
there has been a material violation or breach by Purchaser of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement which would prevent the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of Parent, Holdings and the Company at the Closing and such
violation or breach has not been waived by Parent, Holdings or the Company or
cured by Purchaser within 45 days after written notice thereof by Parent or
Holdings; provided, however, that if Purchaser elects to defer the Closing
pursuant to Section 2.03(a), then the period of such deferral and the cure
period contained in this Section 11.01(e) shall run concurrently and not
consecutively; provided further, however, that there shall be no cure period
if such violation or breach by Purchaser is its willful and intentional
refusal to effect the Closing in breach of this Agreement following the
satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions
set forth in Article VII of this Agreement (other than conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied as of the Closing);

  

  

(f) by Purchaser upon written notice to Parent on or before June 30, 2010, if
Parent has not satisfied the Closing condition set forth in Section 7.02(k)
prior to June 1, 2010;

  

  

(g) by Purchaser upon written notice to Parent on or before June 30, 2010, if
Parent has not obtained the Lender Consents identified in Section 3.11 of the
Disclosure Letter prior to June 1, 2010;

  

  

(h) by Purchaser upon written notice to Parent (i) on or before July 15, 2010,
if any Transaction Document Affiliate has failed, prior to June 15, 2010, to
execute and place into escrow with Parent pending the Closing, each
Transaction Document to which it will be a

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-103-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

party as of the Closing; or (ii) if the trustees have not executed the
releases from Liens under the ACE Mortgage and DPL Mortgage in accordance with
Section 7.02(n) prior to June 15, 2010, provided that if Parent is unable to
obtain such releases within such period, the period shall be extended to July
30, 2010; and

  

  

(i) by Purchaser upon written notice to Parent at any time after September 30,
2010, if there shall be pending a Regulatory Action regarding the Designated
Generating Plants at the time of such termination; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.01(i) shall not
be available to Purchaser unless it has, prior to termination, engaged in good
faith negotiations with Parent between the date of the Regulatory Action and
the first to occur of (A) the 45th day after the date of such Regulatory
Action and (B) December 30, 2010, with a view to amending this Agreement to
allow the transactions contemplated hereby to proceed in a manner that would
enable Purchaser to realize economic value from the Designated Generating
Plants that is at least equal to the economic value that Purchaser would have
realized in the absence of such Regulatory Action (it being understood that
Parent acknowledges that any such amendment shall be subject to Purchaser's
lenders' consent, and the failure of Purchaser to obtain such consent shall
not prohibit Purchaser from having the termination right under this Section
11.01(i)). Parent shall also be required to engage in good faith negotiations
with Purchaser as provided above in this Section 11.01(i).

  

  

11.02 Effect of Termination. Upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 11.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto,
except as set forth in Section 11.03 and except for the provisions of (a)
Section 3.21 (Brokerage), (b) Section 4.10 (Brokerage), (c) Section 6.04(d)
(Confidentiality), (d) this Section 11.02, and (e) Article XII, which shall
survive such termination.

  

  

11.03 Termination Damages.

warranties of Parent, Holdings and the Company contained in Article III failed
to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) due to a breach of a
representation or warranty made as of the date of this Agreement and such
breach of representation and warranty is due to the negligence of Parent,
Holdings or the Company, and at the time of such termination by Purchaser
there is no state of facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected
to cause the conditions in Section 7.01 and 7.03 to not be satisfied at the
time of such termination, then, in lieu of all other claims and remedies that
might otherwise be available to Purchaser with respect thereto and as
Purchaser's exclusive remedy therefor against Parent, its Affiliates and their

available to Purchaser with respect thereto and as Purchaser's exclusive
remedy therefor against Parent, its Affiliates and their Representatives,

Section 11.03(d)), and at the time of such termination by Purchaser there is
no state of facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to cause
the conditions in Section 7.01 and 7.03 to not be satisfied at the time of

other agreement contained in this Agreement, including refusal to effect the
Closing in breach of this Agreement, and such breach is willful and
intentional, and at the time of such termination by Purchaser there is no

termination, then, in lieu of all other claims and remedies that might
otherwise be available to Purchaser with respect thereto and as Purchaser's
exclusive remedy therefor against Parent, its Affiliates and their

respect thereto and as Parent's exclusive remedy therefor against Purchaser,

transfer of immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days
following the date of such termination, as liquidated damages and not as a

thereto and as Parent's exclusive remedy therefor against Purchaser, its
Affiliates (other than with respect to matters governed by the Calpine

(i) If this Agreement is terminated and if the basis for such termination is
due to the failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.02(d) and the
failure of such condition is the result of any action taken, or any omission
to act, by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (notwithstanding the exercise by
Purchaser and its Affiliates of due care), other than any willful and
intentional act or omission that are governed by clause (g) above, then, in
lieu of all other claims and remedies that might otherwise be available to
Parent in the event that the Closing shall not have occurred due to the
failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.02(d) due to any action taken,
or any omission to act, by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, and as Parent's
exclusive remedy therefor against Purchaser, its Affiliates (other than with
respect to matters governed by the Calpine Guarantee) and their
Representatives, Purchaser shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days following the date
of such termination, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, an amount

12.04 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of New York regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

  

  

(b) Each of the parties hereby (i) consents to submit itself to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court located within the borough of
Manhattan in the State of New York in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not
limited to, any dispute arising out of or relating to the Financing
Commitments or the performance thereof, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt
to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from any such court, and (iii) agrees that it will not bring, and will
not permit any of its Affiliates to bring, any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not
limited to, any dispute arising out of or relating to the Financing
Commitments or the performance thereof by the Company or its Representatives,
in any court other than a state or federal court located in located within New
York County in the State of New York.

  

  

(c) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial
by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to,
any dispute arising out of or relating to the Financing Commitments or the

12.05 Specific Performance and Other Remedies.

  

  

(a) With respect to their respective obligations set forth in Sections 6.04(d)
(Confidentiality), 6.06 (No Solicitation), 6.17 (Non-Solicitation of
Employees) and 6.19 (Confidentiality) and Article IX (Employee Matters) (the
"Specified Covenants"), the parties agree that irreparable damage would occur,
damages would be difficult to determine and would be an insufficient remedy
and no other adequate remedy would exist at law or in equity, in each case in
the event that such obligations are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached (or any party hereto threatens such
a breach). It is accordingly agreed that (i) the parties shall be entitled at
their election to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
Specified Covenants and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
the Specified Covenants, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
the parties are entitled at law or in equity, (ii) the parties waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond, guarantee or other
undertaking in connection with the obtaining of any specific performance or
injunctive relief and (iii) the parties will waive, in any action for specific
performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law. Any party's pursuit
of specific performance at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies
or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party
may be entitled, including, without limitation, the right to pursue remedies
for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by such party in the case of a
breach of this Agreement involving fraud or willful or intentional misconduct.

  

  

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 12.05(a), each party acknowledges
and agrees that in the event any provision of this Agreement is not performed
in

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-109-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, (i) such party
will have an adequate remedy at law in the form of money damages (in the case
of Section 11.03 in the amounts set forth therein) and (ii) such party and its
Affiliates shall have no right to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and shall not be entitled to an injunction or any
form of equitable relief to prevent breaches of, or to require compliance
with, this Agreement.

  

  

12.06 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Schedules and Disclosure Letter
referred to herein, and the Calpine Guarantee constitute the entire agreement
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof;
provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded
and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

  

  

12.07 Disclosure Letter. Any information disclosed in one Section of the
Disclosure Letter shall be considered to be made for purposes of all other
Sections of the Disclosure Letter to the extent that the relevance of any such
disclosure to any other Section of the Disclosure Letter is reasonably
apparent from the text of such disclosure. Inclusion of any information in the
Disclosure Letter does not imply that such information would, under the
provisions of this Agreement, have to be included in any Section of the
Disclosure Letter or that such information is otherwise material. In addition,
information disclosed in the Disclosure Letter is not necessarily limited to
information required by this Agreement to be disclosed in the Disclosure
Letter, and any such additional information is set forth for informational
purposes only and does not necessarily include other information of a similar
nature.

  

  

12.08 Amendments. This Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or
supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement
executed by all the parties hereto.

  

  

12.09 Waiver. Any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived at any time prior to the
Closing by any of the parties entitled to the benefit thereof only by a
written instrument signed by each such party granting such waiver, but such
waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation,
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate
as a waiver of or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.
No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right, privilege or
remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any party in
exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall
operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single
or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right,
privilege or remedy.

  

  

12.10 Binding Effect; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be
binding upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of,
the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Subject to
Sections 8.02(a) and (b), 10.03(a) and (b), 11.03 and 12.04, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
(other than the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns)
any rights, claims or benefits whatsoever, and this Agreement does not create
or establish any third party beneficiary rights in any Person, including any
employee or former employee of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-110-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

continued employment, and no provision of this Agreement will create any
rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided,
directly or indirectly, under any employee benefit plan or arrangement except
as expressly provided for thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions of Sections 11.03 and 12.04 insofar as it concerns such lenders and
other Representatives of Purchaser shall be enforceable by the lenders who
have provided the Financing Commitment and other Representatives of Purchaser
and by such Persons' successors and assigns.

  

  

12.11 Assignability. Neither this Agreement nor any party's rights or
obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by such party without the
prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempted assignment or
delegation of this Agreement or any of such rights or obligations by any party
without the prior written consent of the other parties shall be void and of no
effect; provided, however, that any of Parent, Holdings, the Company or
Purchaser may assign or transfer this Agreement to one or more of its
respective Affiliates, but any such assignment shall not, without the express
written consent of the other parties, release the assignor from its
obligations hereunder; provided, further, that Purchaser may assign or
transfer its rights and interests under this Agreement as security or
collateral obligations in connection with any financing transaction involving
one or more of the Companies, but any such assignment shall not release
Purchaser from its obligations hereunder.

  

  

12.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable Law, then such
contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Such
provision shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it
legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such modification shall render it
legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement shall be construed as if not
containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations of
the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly.

  

  

12.13 Counterparts; Facsimile Transmission of Signatures. This Agreement may
be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, and delivered by means of facsimile transmission or
otherwise, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be
an original and all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the
same agreement.

Fuel Inventory Calculations:

  

  

The Estimated Fuel Inventory will be calculated pursuant to the results of the
Inventory Audit. The basic intent and procedures for the Inventory Audit with
respect to the Estimated Fuel Inventory are described below. Fair market value
of Fuel Inventory at each Generating Plant will be the product of Fuel
Quantity (as defined below) multiplied by Fuel Price (as defined below),
consistent with the procedures and guidelines described below. As part of the
Inventory Audit contemplated by Section 2.02 of the Agreement, Parent and
Purchaser will mutually select an independent fuel inspector to conduct a Fuel
Inventory Assessment ("FIA"), defined by the procedures and principles
described below. Parent and Purchaser shall equally share the costs of
conducting such initial FIA as part of the Inventory Audit.

  

  

In order to determine the Closing Date Fuel Inventory, Parent and Purchaser
agree to negotiate in good faith to determine the appropriate procedures to be
used to calculate the adjustments to be made to the Estimated Fuel Inventory
to account for changes in the Fuel Inventory between the Inventory Audit and
11:59 P.M. on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, both Parent or Purchaser have the
option to request that an additional FIA be conducted as of or immediately
prior to the Closing Date, at the requesting Party's sole expense, for
purposes of determining the Closing Date Fuel Inventory; such additional FIA
shall follow the same procedures and principles described herein.

  

  

Fuel Quantity: The FIA will identify the quantity of Usable Fuel (as defined
below, such quantity, the "Fuel Quantity") at each Generating Plant through
certain procedures, including but not be limited to physical observation at
each Generating Plant to identify the amount of Usable Fuel in each tank,
taking into consideration the fuel contents at various locations in the tank.
"Usable Fuel" is defined as the fuel at each Generating Plant that is able to
be used (without requiring mixing with other fuels or dilution) by such
Generating Plant to produce electricity, as determined by the applicable plant
permit, operating specifications and the applicable turbine manufacturer's
specifications; for the avoidance of doubt, Usable Fuel may exist both above
and below the suction line of the tank. All fuel quantities that are
determined to be Usable Fuel, per the definition above, will be included in
the Fuel Quantity and subject to the pricing mechanisms described below.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-118-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Fuel Price: To determine the relevant fair market value pricing for the Fuel
Quantity identified in the FIA (the "Fuel Price"), the quality and grade of
such Fuel Quantity will be taken into account. To determine quality and grade,
multiple samples from multiple levels in each tank will be taken at each
Generating Plant during the FIA, including a bottom sample, lower sample,
middle sample, top sample and water cut. For the avoidance of doubt, the
intent of these procedures will be to assess the quality and grade of the
Usable Fuel in each tank. For any jet fuel that is determined to be Usable
Fuel per the above definition and has a btu content of at least 120,000 btu's
per gallon, the Fuel Price will be the applicable index and adders shown in
Table II below. For all other fuel types that are deemed to be Usable Fuel,
the resulting samples will be compared to the marketable ASTM specifications
for the applicable index listed in Table II at each Generating Plant (such
marketable ASTM specifications are identified in the column labeled
"Descriptions" in Table II) - if the samples are within these marketable ASTM
specifications, the index listed for the applicable Generating Plant will be
used as the relevant Fuel Price, including the identified adders. If the
samples are outside the marketable ASTM specifications, the parties will work
together in good faith to determine a Fuel Price for such quantity of Fuel
Inventory; for the avoidance of doubt, the adder associated with each
Generating Plant in Table II shall apply to the Fuel Price regardless of
whether the fuel is within the indicated marketable ASTM specifications.

Attachment A: Inventory Cost

  

  

The Estimated Inventory Cost will be calculated pursuant to the results of the
Inventory Audit. The Estimated Inventory Cost will be used to calculate the
Closing Payment as follows:

  

    

  |  

 

*

 

  |  

If the Estimated Inventory Cost is greater than $18,890,000, then the amount
of such excess on a dollar-for-dollar basis will be added to the calculation
of the Closing Payment.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

    

  |  

 

*

 

  |  

If the Estimated Inventory Cost is less than $18,890,000, then the amount of
such shortfall on a dollar-for-dollar basis will be subtracted from the
calculation of the Closing Payment.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

    

  |  

 

*

 

  |  

If the Estimated Inventory Cost is equal to $18,890,000, there is no
adjustment to the calculation of the Closing Payment for Estimated Inventory
Cost.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

Such amounts will be subject to a post-Closing adjustment pursuant to Section
2.04 of the Agreement, and the Closing Date Inventory Cost will be used to
calculate the post-Closing adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  


 

  

Sample Calculation:

  

If the Estimated Inventory Cost resulting from the Inventory Audit is
$18,963,000, in accordance with Section 2.02(e) of the Agreement, $73,000
shall be added to the Closing Payment that Purchaser shall pay to Holdings at
the Closing ($18,963,000 - $18,890,000 = $73,000). Such amount will be subject
to a post-Closing adjustment pursuant to Section 2.04 of the Agreement.

PJM Capacity Deficiency Charge Calculation

  

  


 

  

  

    

A.

  |  

Capacity Resource Deficiency Charge

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

The Capacity Resource Deficiency Charge will be calculated as the total
monthly charges from the PJM ISO that Purchaser will incur to fill its 2010/11
planning year UCAP obligation.

  


 

  


 

  

2010/11 Capacity Resource Deficiency Charge = (Cleared 2010/11 UCAP of 3,627
MW - Owned UCAP of 3651.5 MW ) x Cost2010/11 x 365

  


 

  

where:

  


 

  

Owned UCAP of 3,651.5 MW includes 25.6 MW of Available Capacity from Tasley 10
unit and 34.1 MW purchased UCAP.

  


 

  

Cost2010/11 = Net cost in $ per MW-Day of the UCAP obligation make whole
position already executed by the Company

  


 

  

If the result of such calculation above is negative, then the value that will
be applied for the Capacity Resource Deficiency Charge shall be zero.

  


 

  


 

  

B. Payment for Purchased Capacity for Planning Year 2010/11

  


 

  

Purchased UCAP payment = Purchased UCAP of 34.1 MW x Purchased Price of
$50/MW-day x 365 days less any purchased capacity payments made by Parent
through the Closing Date.

Schedule VI

  

  

Post-Closing Settlement Charges

  

  


 

  

  

A. March 2011 Settlement Calculation

  


 

  

March 2011 Settlement Calculation: (i) Allocation of 2011/2012 Capacity
Resource Deficiency Charge + (ii) Allocation of Charges for Summer Capacity
Testing Charges

  


 

  

(i) Allocation of 2011/2012 Capacity Resource Deficiency Charge

  


 

  

Comment: The intent is to allocate a known charge (based on published PJM
data, net of any UCAP buy-backs) to Parent and Purchaser based on their share
of contributed equivalent forced outage hours.

  


 

  

PJM will publish rolling 12-month historical performance information in the
Fall of 2010 which will affect Purchaser's capacity position and revenues for
the 2011/12 planning year. The cost associated with any shortfall in UCAP for
2011/12 determined will be allocated between Parent and Purchaser according to
the share of outage time which occurred under their respective ownership. The
portion of the total estimated PJM charge attributable to forced outages that
occurred under Parent's ownership will be covered by Parent:

  


 

  

Allocated 2011/12 Capacity Resource Deficiency Charge = EFOHPHI / EFOHTotal x
2011/12 Capacity Resource Deficiency Charge

  


 

  

where:

  


 

  

EFOHPHI = MW-Weighted Equivalent Forced Outage Hours from 10/1/09 to the
Closing Date

  


 

  

EFOHTotal = MW-Weighted Equivalent Forced Outage Hours from 10/1/09 to 9/30/10

  


 

  

MW-Weighted = EFOH x by related plant ICAP

  


 

  

2011/12 Capacity Resource Deficiency Charge = (Cleared 2011/12 UCAP of 3,747.4
MW - Actual UCAP Position as determined by PJM) x Cost2011/12 x 365

  


 

  

Cost2010/11 =

  

A.) Applicable clearing price in the February 2011 Incremental Auction for the
2011/12 planning year (if capacity is successfully procured), or

  

B.) a MW-Weighted average price of the Incremental Auction clearing price and
the BRA Price for EMAAC + 20% (if the capacity shortfall is only partially
cleared in the Incremental Auction), or

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-124-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

C.) the BRA Price for EMAAC + 20% (if capacity cannot be procured in the
Incremental Auction)

  


 

  

Comment: The 2011/12 Capacity Resource Deficiency Charge will reflect the
pricing level at which Purchaser covers the position in the Incremental
Auction unless capacity cannot be procured.

  


 

  

(ii) Allocation of Charges for Summer Capacity Testing Charges

  


 

  

Comment: The intent is to create a fall-back mechanism for ICAP test results
in the event the Closing Date is delayed beyond August 1, 2010. If the Closing
occurs prior to August 1, 2010, then this calculation does not apply.

  


 

  

If the Closing is delayed and Purchaser's ownership period during the Summer
of 2010 is compressed, then the capacity tests under the Company's ownership
could have an impact on Purchaser's economics for the full 2010/11 planning
year. If the Closing Date is delayed beyond August 1, 2010, then the 2010/11
Capacity Testing Charge will be calculated as:

  


 

  

2010/11 Capacity Testing Charge = ICAP Shortfall (if applicable) x (1 -
EFORdeffective) x BRA Price x 365

  


 

  

where:

  


 

  

ICAP Shortfall = Unit ICAP Shortfall as determined by PJM

  


 

  

EFORdeffective = Published unit effective EFORd for 2010/11 planning year

  


 

  

BRA Price = 2010/11 Base Residual Auction UCAP clearing price for EMAAC of
$174.29 per MW-Day

  


 

  


 

  


 

  

B. December 2011 Settlement Calculation ("Capacity Charge True-Up B")

  


 

  

(i) Peak Hour Availability Charges

  


 

  

PJM will finalize its calculations of peak hour availability performance
during the Fall of 2011 and either charge Purchaser for performance below
target or pay Purchaser for performance above target. A second capacity charge
true-up will be determined in the Fall of 2011 if a charge is levied by PJM.
Parent and Purchaser will allocate any charge between themselves according to
outage time under each period of ownership:

  


 

  

Capacity Charge True-Up B = Allocated 2010/11 Peak Hour Availability Charge
(if applicable)

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-125-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Final 2010/11 Peak Hour Availability Charge Adjustment =

  

If PJM charge is positive (Purchaser owes PJM) = EFOHPHI / EFOHTotal x

  

Total Peak Hour Availability Charge per PJM

  


 

  

where:

  


 

  

EFOHPHI = MW-Weighted Equivalent Forced Outage Hours from 6/1/10 to the
Closing Date, during peak period hours as defined by PJM (for units assessed
by the EFORp metric in PJM's calculations) or all hours (for units assessed by
the EFORd metric)

  


 

  

EFOHTotal = MW-Weighted Equivalent Forced Outage Hours from 6/1/10 to 5/31/11,
during peak period hours as defined by PJM (for units assessed by the EFORp
metric in PJM's calculations) or all hours (for units assessed by the EFORd
metric)

  


 

  

Total Peak Hour Availability Charge per PJM = as determined by PJM

  


 

  

Capacity Charge True-Up B will be payable to Purchaser from Parent (if PJM
charge is positive) in December of 2011.

provided, however, that the indemnifying party (or its Affiliate) may, in good
faith contest the validity or application of any such Legal Requirement and,
pending the final determination of such contest, may postpone compliance
therewith but not so as to subject the indemnified party (or its Affiliate) to
any fine or penalty or to prosecution for a crime, to cause the Premises or
any part thereof to be condemned or to be vacated or to cause any public
liability or casualty insurance to become void;. If civil liability is
incurred by reason of noncompliance, the indemnifying party may nevertheless

responsible or liable in case of any accident or injury to any of Tenant's
servants, employees, or tenants or to any person or persons in or about the

not hold Landlord in any way responsible or liable therefor and will further
indemnify and hold harmless Landlord from and against any and all claims made
by any party and all liability, penalties, damages, expenses and judgments
arising from injury to persons or property of any nature and also for any
matter or thing which shall or may happen in or upon, growing out of the
occupation of or otherwise in connection with the Premises (exclusive of the
Landlord Property); provided, however, that the foregoing provisions of this
Section shall not apply to any claims, liability, injury, damage or thing
caused by a negligent act or willful misconduct on the part of Landlord or its
agents, servants or employees.

  

  

Section 4.06. Both Landlord (in furtherance of its reservation of rights
pursuant to Section 22.01 hereof), and Tenant (in furtherance of the grants
encompassed by this Article 4) shall have the right to install their
interconnection equipment within the Premises (including within the Landlord
Property) as reasonably required to implement the interconnection contemplated

the right to "connect to" or "mount upon" the other Party\'s equipment or

all documents, agreements and instruments and to take all other actions as may

(100%) replacement value of the Building. Any deductible is to be borne by
Tenant.

  

  

(c) All insurance policies carried pursuant to Subsections (a) and (b) of
Section 6.01 may expressly provide that any losses thereunder shall be
adjusted with Tenant and any Leasehold Mortgagee.

  

  

Section 6.02. [Intentionally Omitted].

  

  

Section 6.03. Landlord shall, at Tenant's cost and expense, cooperate fully
with Tenant in order to obtain the largest possible recovery under any
insurance policy carried by Tenant and shall execute any and all consents or
other documents and take all other actions necessary in order to effectuate
the same and to cause such proceeds to be paid in accordance with the
provisions of this Lease.

  

  

Section 6.04. (a) Tenant shall require of all Subtenants a waiver of
subrogation on their property and time element policies in favor of Landlord
and Tenant.

  

  

(b) If the inclusion of such clause or endorsement in a policy procured by
Subtenant would result in an increase in the premium for such Subtenant, such
Subtenant shall notify Tenant of the amount of such increase and the Tenant
may, but shall not be obligated to, pay the same; provided, that if Tenant
does not pay the same within ten (10) days after such notice, such Subtenant
may omit such clause or endorsement.

  

  

Section 6.05. Each insurance policy carried pursuant to this Article 6 shall,
to the extent obtainable, contain an agreement by the insurer that such policy
shall not be cancelled

without at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, except for ten (10)
days prior written notice as respects non-payment of premium, to Landlord and
any Leasehold Mortgagee.

  

  

Section 6.06. Tenant Indemnification. Tenant shall indemnify, hold harmless
and defend Landlord and its Affiliates, and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, invitees, and
successors, as the case may be, from and against any and all claims,
liabilities, costs, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorney and
expert fees, and disbursements incurred by any of them in any action or
proceeding brought by any third party or tenant) (i) for damages to property,
injury to or death of any person, including Landlord's employees or any third
parties, to the extent caused wholly or in part by any act or omission,
negligent or otherwise, by Tenant and/or its officers, directors, employees,
agents, contractors, subcontractors, or invitees arising out of or connected
with this Lease, including a failure by Tenant to perform its obligations
hereunder or (ii) on account of the presence, alleged presence, Release or
threatened Release of any Hazardous Materials on, under or migrating from the
Premises (other than Landlord Property and except to the extent attributable
to Landlord's operation and maintenance of its transmission and distribution
facilities). Landlord shall not be entitled to indemnity under the preceding
sentence to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that
its gross negligence or willful misconduct caused such damages.

  

  

Section 6.07. Landlord Indemnification. Landlord shall indemnify, hold
harmless and defend Tenant and its Affiliates, and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, invitees and
successors, as the case may be, from and against any and all claims,
liabilities, costs, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorney and
expert fees, and disbursements incurred by any of them in any action or
proceeding brought by any third party or Landlord) (i) for damages to
property, injury to or death of any person, including Tenant's employees or
any third parties, to the extent caused wholly or in part by any act or

Section 6.08. Indemnification Procedures. If a party intends to seek
indemnification under this Article 6 from the other party, the party seeking
indemnification shall give the other party notice of such claim within ninety
(90) days after the later of (a) the commencement of, or (b) the party's
actual knowledge of, such claim. Such notice shall describe the claim in
reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated if necessary) of
the claim that has been, or may be sustained by, said party. To the extent
that the other party is actually and materially prejudiced as a result of
failure to provide such notice, such notice shall be a condition precedent to
any liability of such other party under the provisions for indemnification
contained in this Lease. Neither party may settle or compromise any claim with
respect to which indemnify may be sought under Sections 6.06 and/or 6.07
without the prior consent of the other party; provided, however, that said
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Section 6.09. The indemnification obligations of each party under this Article

ARTICLE 7 
 

  

  

Damage to or Destruction of the Building

  

  

Section 7.01. If the Building or any other part of the Premises shall be
wholly destroyed or substantially damaged by fire or other casualty at any
time during the term of this Lease and Tenant shall decide not to rebuild or
restore the Building or such other part of the Premises, then each of Tenant
and Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease as hereinafter provided. Within
one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of such damage or destruction,
Tenant shall give Landlord a notice indicating whether or not Tenant elects to
rebuild or restore the Building or such other part of the Premises and stating
that either (i) Tenant has elected not to terminate this Lease or (ii) Tenant
has elected to terminate this Lease, which latter notice shall specify a date
at least thirty (30) days after the date of the giving of such notice upon
which date this Lease shall terminate (the "Casualty Termination Date"). If
Tenant has elected to terminate this Lease, Tenant shall, at Tenant's option,
either (i) be responsible for demolishing any and all improvements on the Land
and returning the Land to its natural state, all in full compliance with
environmental laws and other Legal Requirements applicable to closing out a
facility, or (ii) pay to Landlord an amount equal to the cost of such
demolition and restoration. Upon payment of any sums due Landlord hereunder,
this Lease and the term and estate hereby granted shall terminate on the
Casualty Termination Date with the same effect as if such date were the
Expiration Date. If Tenant shall decide not to rebuild the Building or restore
the Premises and shall elect not to terminate this Lease as aforesaid,
Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease by giving written notice of such
election to Tenant within thirty (30) days after receipt of Tenant's notice of
election. In the event of termination of this Lease by either Landlord or
Tenant as aforesaid, any insurance proceeds payable on account of such damage
or destruction shall belong to and be the property of Leasehold Mortgagee to
the extent of amounts owed to Leasehold Mortgagee, and the balance of any
insurance proceeds shall belong to and be the property of Tenant. If neither
party shall elect to terminate this Lease as above provided, this Lease shall
continue in full force and effect, Tenant having no obligation to rebuild or
restore the Building or the Premises, but Tenant shall perform such work as
may be required by Legal Requirements to render the Building safe and secure.

  

  

ARTICLE 8 
 

  

  

Condemnation

  

  

Section 8.01. (a) If, at any time during the term of this Lease, there should
be a taking of all or substantially all of the Building or the Premises or a
Constructive Total Taking of the Building or the Premises by the exercise of
any of condemnation or eminent domain or by agreement between Landlord and
Tenant or among Landlord, Tenant and those authorized to exercise such right,
this Lease shall terminate on, and the rent and all other charges payable
hereunder shall be apportioned as of and paid to, the date of such taking. In
such event, Tenant (as to the Premises and the Buildings, including any and
all improvements thereto and equipment

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

thereon owned by Tenant) and Landlord (as to Landlord\'s Property) shall
remove all improvements and equipment in accordance with applicable law, prior
to the date of such taking provided that Landlord shall be responsible for
removing its equipment located on the Premises or in the Buildings, and Tenant
shall be responsible for removing its equipment located on Landlord's
Property. For the purposes of this Article, the term a "Constructive Total
Taking" shall mean a taking of such portion of the Building or the Premises
that, in Tenant's reasonable discretion, the untaken portion of the Premises
is insufficient to permit the continued use of the Building or the Premises,
or the remaining portion thereof, for Tenant's purposes.

  

  

(b) In the event of any such taking, each of Landlord and Tenant shall be
entitled to share in the proceeds to such taking (the "Condemnation Proceeds")
to the extent of its respective interest in the Premises, taking into account
the value of Tenant's leasehold interests under this Lease and Landlord's
residual interests in and to the Premises, the remaining term under this Lease
and the rent payable hereunder.

  

  

(c) If at the time of any total taking or Constructive Total Taking any
insurance proceeds payable on account of damage to or destruction of the
Premises shall be held by Tenant, such insurance proceeds shall belong to and
be the property of the Leasehold Mortgagee to the extent of amounts owed to
any such Leasehold Mortgagee, and the remainder of such insurance proceeds
shall belong to and be the property of Tenant.

  

  

Section 8.02. In the event of a taking under circumstances in which this Lease
has not been terminated, each of Landlord and Tenant shall be entitled to
share in the Condemnation Proceeds as shall represent compensation for the
value of the portion of the Premises so taken to the extent of its respective
interest in such portion of the Premises, taking into account the value of
Tenant's ownership of the Building and its leasehold interests under this
Lease and Landlord's residual interests in and to the Premises, the remaining
term under this Lease and the rent payable hereunder.

  

  

Section 8.03. If the whole or any part of the Premises, or Tenant's leasehold
estate under this Lease, shall be taken in condemnation proceedings or by any
right of eminent domain for temporary use or occupancy, the foregoing
provisions of this Article shall not apply and Tenant shall continue to pay,
in the manner and at the times herein specified, the full amount of the rent
and all additional rent and, except only to the extent that Tenant may be
prevented from so doing pursuant to the terms of the order of the condemning
authority. Tenant shall perform and observe all of the other terms, covenants,
conditions and obligations hereof upon the part of Tenant to be performed and
observed, as though such taking has not occurred. In the event of any taking
of the character referred to in this Section, Tenant, subject to any Leasehold
Mortgagee's right to Condemnation Proceeds in respect of such taking, shall be
entitled to receive the entire amount of such Condemnation Proceeds, whether
paid by way of damages, rent or otherwise, unless such period of temporary use
or occupancy shall extend beyond the Expiration Date of this Lease, in which
case the Condemnation Proceeds shall be apportioned between Landlord and
Tenant as of the Expiration Date.

  

  

Section 8.04. If the order or decree in any condemnation or similar proceeding
shall fail separately to state each amount to be awarded to Landlord and each
amount to be awarded to Tenant under the foregoing provisions of this Article,
by way of compensation, damages, rent,

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

the cost (estimated or actual) of demolition, removal or restoration, or
otherwise, and if Landlord and Tenant cannot agree thereon within thirty (30)
days after the final award or awards shall have been fixed and determined,
such dispute shall be resolved in the manner provided in Article 12.

  

  

ARTICLE 9 
 

  

  

Assignment, Mortgage, Subletting, Etc.

  

  

Section 9.01. (a) Without the consent of Landlord, Tenant shall have the
right, at any time and from time to time, to assign, mortgage, pledge,
encumber and in any manner transfer this Lease, or any part hereof, and
sublease the Premises, or any part thereof, and assign, mortgage, pledge,
encumber and in any manner transfer the interest of Tenant in any Sublease of
all or a part of the Premises or the rentals thereunder. In the event that
Tenant shall make an assignment of this Lease, Tenant shall cause the assignee
to assume all the obligations of the assignor first accruing from and after
the date of such assignment and Landlord agrees that, except for the
assignor's liabilities accruing before the date of assignment, the assignor
shall ipso facto and without the necessity of Landlord's execution of any
instrument, be released from its obligations under this Lease.

  

  

(b) Without the consent of Tenant, Landlord shall have the right, at any time
and from time to time, to assign, mortgage, pledge, encumber and in any manner
transfer its interest in this Lease, in whole but not in part hereof. In the
event of a sale by Landlord of its interests in the Premises as provided
herein and the assumption by the buyer of all of the obligations of the seller
first accruing from and after the date of such sale, Tenant agrees that,
except for the seller's liabilities accruing before the date of sale, the
seller shall ipso facto and without the necessity of Tenant's execution of any
instrument, be released from its obligations under this Lease. For avoidance
of doubt, any conveyance of and any encumbrance of or security interest in all
or part of Landlord's interest in the Premises shall be subject and
subordinate to and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease
and to Tenant's (or Tenant's mortgagee's, pursuant to Section 9.03) rights
hereunder.

  

  

Section 9.02. (a) Tenant shall give notice to Landlord of each Sublease of all
or part of the Premises setting forth the identity of the Subtenant, the
nature of its business and its proposed use of the subleased premises. Each
Sublease shall be subject and subordinate to this Lease and the rights of
Landlord hereunder and any violation of any provisions of this Lease by any
Subtenant shall be deemed a violation of such provision by Tenant. No Sublease
shall provide for a term which extends beyond the day prior to the Expiration
Date hereunder. In the event of Tenant's default beyond any applicable grace
period, Landlord may collect rent from any Subtenant so long as such default
shall continue, and Landlord may apply the same to the curing of any default
hereunder in any order of priority Landlord may select, any unapplied balance
thereof to be applied by Landlord against subsequent installments of rent, but
Landlord's collection of rent from a Subtenant shall not constitute a
recognition by Landlord of attornment by such Subtenant.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) Any act required to be performed by Tenant pursuant to the provisions of
this Lease may be performed by any Subtenant and Landlord shall accept such
performance on the part of the Subtenant as though the same had been performed
by the Tenant.

  

  

(c) Each and every assignee, whether as assignee or as successor in interest
to any assignee of the Tenant herein named, including any purchaser of this
Lease under a foreclosure of any Leasehold Mortgage or other lien on this
Lease, shall, except as otherwise provided herein, immediately be and become
and remain liable for the payment of the rent and other charges payable under
this Lease, and for the due performance of all the covenants, agreements,
terms and provisions of this Lease on Tenant's part to be performed, including
to the full end of the term of this Lease and each and every provision of this
Lease applicable to Tenant shall also apply to and bind every such assignee
and purchaser with the same force and effect as though such assignee or
purchaser were the Tenant named in this Lease.

  

  

(d) Except as provided in this Article 9, no assignment of Tenant's interest
in this Lease shall be valid and no assignee shall take possession of the
Premises or any portion thereof until an executed counterpart of the agreement
of assignment and an agreement by the assignee assuming the obligations of
Tenant hereunder for the balance of the term of this Lease, both of which
agreements shall be in recordable form, shall have been delivered to Landlord.

  

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.01, Tenant may assign its
interests in this Lease or its interests as sublandlord in any Subleases to a
Leasehold Mortgagee as further security for the indebtedness outstanding under
such Leasehold Mortgage without obtaining an agreement from such Leasehold
Mortgagee assuming the obligations of Tenant hereunder; provided, that as a
condition precedent to the exercise of such Leasehold Mortgagee of its
enforcement remedies against this Lease under any such assignment, the
Leasehold Mortgagee shall assume Tenant's obligations under this Lease first
accruing on and after the date of exercise of such enforcement remedies by
Leasehold Mortgagee.

  

  

Section 9.03. Tenant from time to time during the term of this Lease, may
encumber its interests under this Lease and in the Premises by entering into
one or more Leasehold Mortgages, in each case without the consent of Landlord;
provided, that any such Leasehold Mortgage shall be expressly subject to the
terms of this Lease, including the rights of Landlord under this Lease. Tenant
or the Leasehold Mortgagee shall promptly deliver to Landlord a true copy of
each Leasehold Mortgage and of any assignment thereof and shall notify
Landlord of the address of the Leasehold Mortgagee to which notices may be
sent. So long as any such Leasehold Mortgage shall remain unsatisfied of
record or until written notice of satisfaction is given by the holder thereof
to Landlord, the following provisions shall apply:

  

  

(a) When giving notice to Tenant of any default under the provisions of this
Lease, Landlord will simultaneously also send a copy of such notice to each
Leasehold Mortgagee for whom Landlord has received a notice setting forth such
Leasehold Mortgagee's address and a copy of the Leasehold Mortgage and of any
assignment thereof,

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

as set forth above, and no such notice to Tenant shall be effective unless a
copy of such notice is so sent to each Leasehold Mortgagee who is not an
Affiliate;

  

  

(b) If Tenant shall default under any provisions of this Lease, any Leasehold
Mortgagee shall have the right to cure such default whether the same consists
of the failure to pay rent or the failure to perform any other matter or thing
which Tenant is hereby required to do or perform and Landlord shall accept
such performance on the part of the Leasehold Mortgagee as though the same had
been performed by Tenant;

  

  

(c) Each Leasehold Mortgagee will have a period of sixty (60) days after the
giving of the aforesaid notice to Leasehold Mortgagee within which to remedy a
monetary default or cause the same to be remedied;

  

  

(d) In the case of any default by Tenant, other than in the payment of money
hereunder, Landlord shall give any First Leasehold Mortgagee reasonable time
within which either (i) to obtain possession of the Premises (including
possession by a receiver) and cure such default in the case of a default which
is susceptible of being cured when the First Leasehold Mortgagee has obtained
possession, or (ii) to institute foreclosure proceedings and complete such
foreclosure, or otherwise acquire Tenant's interests under this Lease, with
diligence and continuity in the case of a default which is not so susceptible
of being cured by the First Leasehold Mortgagee; provided, however, that the
First Leasehold Mortgagee shall not be required to continue such possession or
continue such foreclosure proceedings if the default which would have been the
reason for serving such second notice shall be cured; and provided further,
that nothing in this Subsection (d) shall require Landlord to refrain from
taking action to terminate this Lease (A) unless the First Leasehold Mortgagee
has agreed to perform the obligations of Tenant hereunder upon obtaining
possession of the Premises, the completion of foreclosure proceedings or
otherwise acquiring Tenant's interest under this Lease, and (B) in the case of
a monetary default or a default in the performance of a nonmonetary obligation
of Tenant hereunder which may be cured by the First Leasehold Mortgagee
without first obtaining possession of the Premises, completing a foreclosure
proceeding or otherwise acquiring Tenant's interests under this Lease, unless
the First Leasehold Mortgagee shall cure any such monetary default and agree
to thereafter perform such monetary obligation and/or shall agree to procure
any such nonmonetary default and to thereafter perform such nonmonetary
obligation, as the case may be, and (C) if the First Leasehold Mortgagee shall
not have a net worth in excess of one hundred million Dollars
($100,000,000.00) unless the First Leasehold Mortgagee shall by cash, by a
surety company bond or by other security (all of which shall be in an amount,
with a company and in substance approved by Landlord) secure performance of
the obligations which the First Leasehold Mortgagee has agreed to perform
pursuant to clauses (A) and (B) above;

  

  

(e) A Leasehold Mortgagee or its designee may become the legal owner and
holder of this Lease by foreclosure of its Leasehold Mortgage or as a result
of the assignment of this Lease in lieu of foreclosure, whereupon such
Leasehold Mortgagee or its designee shall immediately become and remain liable
under this Lease as provided herein, except that any liability imposed hereby
upon such Leasehold Mortgagee or its designee

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

shall be expressly limited to the period of ownership by such Leasehold
Mortgagee or its designee of this Lease;

  

  

(f) Landlord shall notify each Leasehold Mortgagee within two (2) business
days after the termination of this Lease or of any succeeding lease made
pursuant to the provisions of this Subsection (f) prior to its stated
expiration date. Within ten (10) days after the First Leasehold Mortgagee's
making the request specified in Section 9.03(f)(i) below, Landlord will enter
into a new lease of the Premises with the First Leasehold Mortgagee or its
designee for the remainder of the term, effective as of the date of such
termination, at the rent and additional rent and upon the covenants,
agreements, terms, provisions and limitations herein contained, and subject to
the then existing condition of the Premises and any rights of Subtenants;
provided, that:

  

  

(i) Such First Leasehold Mortgagee makes written request upon Landlord for
such new lease within forty (40) days from the date of such termination; and

  

  

(ii) Such First Leasehold Mortgagee pays to Landlord at the time of the
execution and delivery of said new lease any and all out of pocket sums
incurred by Landlord for fees of its legal advisors in connection with the
execution and delivery of such new lease;

  

  

(g) Upon the execution and delivery of such new lease in accordance with the
provisions of Subsection (f) above, all Subleases which theretofore may have
been assigned and transferred to Landlord shall thereupon be assigned and
transferred without recourse by Landlord to the First Leasehold Mortgagee (or
its designee), as the new Tenant; except that any liability imposed thereunder
upon the First Leasehold Mortgagee (or its designee) as tenant thereunder
shall be expressly limited to such obligations first accruing during the
period while the First Leasehold Mortgagee (or its designee) is the tenant
under such new lease; and

  

  

(h) If under the provisions of Subsection (e) above or under any new lease
made in accordance with the provisions of Subsection (f) above, a Leasehold
Mortgagee shall be the Tenant, as a trustee, each and every obligation of such
trustee shall be binding upon it solely in its fiduciary capacity and shall
have no force or effect against such Leasehold Mortgagee in its individual
capacity.

  

  

Section 9.04. (a) Except for the rights of a First Leasehold Mortgagee to
obtain a new lease of the Premises as set forth in Section 9.03(f), no
mortgage now or hereafter a lien upon this Lease, the Premises, or any portion
thereof, shall extend or affect the reversionary interest and estate of
Landlord in and to the Premises.

  

  

(b) Each Leasehold Mortgagee shall be given notice of any mediation
proceedings or litigation by the parties hereto, and shall have the right to
participate in such proceedings.

  

  

(c) The term "Mortgage" whenever used herein, shall also include any
instruments required in connection with a sale-leaseback or other financing
transaction of Tenant's interest under this Lease.

ARTICLE 10 
 

  

  

Landlord's Right to Perform Tenant's Covenants;

  

  

Cumulative Remedies; Waivers

  

  

Section 10.01. If (a) Tenant shall at any time fail to perform any act
required on its part to be performed under this Lease and (b) such default
shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days (or, in the event of an
emergency, such shorter period of time as shall be reasonable under the
circumstances) after written notice thereof, specifying such default, shall
have been given to Tenant or, in the case of a non-monetary default which
cannot with reasonable diligence be remedied by Tenant within thirty (30)
days, if Tenant shall fail to proceed as promptly as may reasonably be
possible after the service of such notice and with reasonable diligence to
remedy the default or shall thereafter fail to prosecute the remedying of such
default with reasonable diligence, then Landlord may, but shall not be
obligated, upon not less than ten (10) days, written notice to Tenant (or, in
the event of an emergency, upon such shorter notice as shall be reasonable
under the circumstances) and without waiving or releasing Tenant from any
obligation of Tenant in this Lease contained, perform such act for the account
of and at the expense of Tenant. All sums so paid and all expenses incurred by
Landlord in connection with the performance of any such act, together with
interest thereon from the date of such expenditure at the Default Rate, shall
be payable by Tenant to Landlord on demand or at the option of Landlord may be
added to any rent then due or thereafter becoming due under this Lease. All
sums which may become payable to Landlord by Tenant in accordance with this
Article 10 and all other charges and expenses of whatsoever nature which
Tenant is required to pay pursuant to this Lease, if not paid when due, shall
be deemed additional rent hereunder and payable as aforesaid, and Landlord
shall have (in addition to any other right or remedy of Landlord) the same
rights and remedies in the event of the non-payment of any such sums by Tenant
as in the case of default by Tenant in the payment of rent.

  

  

Section 10.02. Landlord may waive any breach or threatened breach of any
covenant, agreement, provision or condition herein contained, but the mention
herein of any particular remedy shall not preclude Landlord from any other
remedy it might have either at law or in equity. The failure of Landlord to
insist upon the strict performance of any one of the covenants, agreements,
provisions or conditions contained in this Lease or to exercise any right,
remedy or election herein contained or permitted by law shall not constitute
or be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of any right arising out of the
failure to perform such covenant, agreement, provision or condition, or of the
right to exercise any remedy or election with respect thereto, but the same
shall continue and remain in full force and effect. Any right or remedy of
Landlord in this Lease specified and any other right or remedy that Landlord
may have at law, in equity or otherwise, upon breach of any covenant,
agreement, provision or condition in this Lease contained upon the part of
Tenant to be performed shall be distinct, separate and cumulative rights or
remedies and no one of them, whether exercised by Landlord or not, shall be
deemed to be to the exclusion of any other. No covenant, agreement, term,
provision or condition of this Lease shall be deemed to have been waived by
Landlord unless such waiver be in writing and signed by Landlord or Landlord's
agent duly authorized in writing. Except as provided in Article 17, the
consent of Landlord to any act or matter must be in writing and shall apply
only with respect to the particular act or matter to which such consent is
given and shall not relieve Tenant from the obligation wherever required under
this Lease to obtain the consent of Landlord

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

to any other act or matter. Receipt or acceptance of any rental by Landlord
shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any default under the covenants,
agreements, provisions and conditions of this Lease or of any right which
Landlord may be entitled to exercise hereunder. In the event that Tenant is in
arrears in the payment of any rent or other charge payable hereunder, Tenant
waives Tenant's right, if any, to designate the items against which any
payments made by Tenant are to be credited and Tenant agrees that Landlord may
apply any payments made by Tenant to any items Landlord sees fit irrespective
of and notwithstanding any designation or request by Tenant as to the items
against which any such payments shall be credited.

  

  

Section 10.03. If Tenant shall fail to make any payment due to Landlord under
this Article 10 or otherwise required hereunder within five (5) days after the
due date thereof, such payment shall bear interest from the date on which the
same shall have become due at an annual rate (the "Default Rate") equal to the
greater of (a) four (4) percentage points above the fluctuating annual
interest rate from time to time announced by Citibank, N.A. as its commercial
prime rate and (b) twelve percent (12%), but in no event in excess of the
maximum legal rate of interest then chargeable to Tenant under the laws of the
State of New Jersey.

  

  

ARTICLE 11 
 

  

  

Dispute Resolution

  

  

Section 11.01. The parties hereto agree to use their best efforts to resolve
any dispute arising hereunder through discussions between senior
representatives of Landlord and Tenant. To the extent, however, that any such
dispute cannot be resolved following good faith discussions between the
parties, the parties shall endeavor to settle any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Lease by mediation under the CPR Mediation Procedure then in
effect (the "Rules").

  

  

Section 11.02. (a) Unless otherwise agreed, the parties will select a mediator
from the CPR Panels of Distinguished Neutrals.

  

  

(b) If the dispute has not been resolved by mediation within forty-five [45]
days of the initiation of such procedure, either party may initiate
litigation; provided, however, that if one party has requested the other to
participate in mediation and the other has failed to participate, the
requesting party may initiate litigation before expiration of the above
period.

  

  

(c) During the pendency of any mediation process, all time periods during
which either party was to perform under this Lease shall be tolled.

  

  

(d) Provisions of the Rules which are inconsistent with the provisions of this

End of Term; Surrender

  

  

Section 20.01. Upon the Expiration Date or the date of earlier termination of
this Lease (collectively, the "Termination Date") Tenant shall peaceably
surrender and yield up unto Landlord all and singular the Premises. Landlord
reserves the right, unless a First Leasehold Mortgagee is then entitled to
receive a new lease pursuant to Section 9.03, to require that Tenant remove
all of Tenant's equipment and facilities which may then be located on the
Premises and/or Landlord Property and demolish any and all Buildings and
improvements on the Premises and restore the Premises to its natural state,
all in full compliance with environmental laws and

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

other Legal Requirements applicable to closing a facility. Upon the
Termination Date, Landlord may without further notice enter upon, reenter,
possess and repossess itself of the Premises, by force, summary proceedings,
ejectment or otherwise, and may dispossess and remove Tenant and all other
persons and property from the Premises, subject to the rights, if any, of a

Subtenant which shall remain on the Premises after the Termination Date and
the removal of Tenant from the Premises may, at the option of Landlord, unless
a First Leasehold Mortgagee is then entitled to receive a new lease pursuant
to Section 9.03, be deemed to have been abandoned by Tenant and may either be
retained by Landlord as its property or be disposed of, without
accountability, in such manner as Landlord may seem fit. If such property or
any part thereof be sold, Landlord may receive and retain the proceeds of such
sale and apply the same, at its option, against the expenses of the sale, the
cost of moving and storage, any arrears of basic rent or additional rent or
other charges payable hereunder and any damages to which Landlord may be
entitled pursuant to law. From and after the Termination Date, Landlord shall
not be responsible for any loss or damage occurring to any property owned by
Tenant, unless caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Landlord, its agents or employees.

hereunder shall continue to be payable in all events, and that the obligations
of Tenant hereunder shall continue unaffected, unless the requirement to pay
or perform the same shall have been terminated pursuant to an express
provision of this Lease. Rent, additional rent and all other sums payable
hereunder by Tenant shall be paid without notice or demand, and without
setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, abatement, suspension, deferment,
diminution, deduction, reduction or defense, except as otherwise specifically
set forth herein. This Lease shall not terminate and Tenant shall not have any
right to terminate this Lease, during the term (except as otherwise expressly
provided herein). Tenant agrees that, except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, it shall not take any action to terminate, reject, rescind or avoid
this Lease, notwithstanding (i) the bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or other
proceeding affecting Landlord, Tenant or any assignee or Subtenant of Tenant,
(ii) the exercise of any remedy including foreclosure, under any documents
securing any construction financing, or (iii) any action with respect to this
Lease (including the disaffirmance hereof) which may be taken by Landlord
under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or by any trustee, receiver or liquidator of
Landlord or by any court under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, or
(iv) the conditions of the leased Premises. Tenant waives all rights which are
not expressly stated herein but which may now or hereafter

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

otherwise be conferred by law to quit, terminate or surrender this Lease or

Reservation of Use; Removal of Equipment

  

  

Section 22.01. Landlord reserves unto itself, its affiliates, successors and
assigns the right to own, operate, maintain, repair, upgrade, install, alter,
remove, inspect, construct, modify, restore, rebuild, replace and expand the
Utility Facilities located now or in the future in, under, through, upon, over
and across the Land, including the right of access thereto, for the purposes
of conducting the business of providing utility service to its customers. Such
existing Utility Facilities are delineated on Exhibit "B" attached hereto and
incorporated herein ("Landlord Property"). Landlord shall utilize its future
reserved rights only in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with
Tenant's business or Tenant's use of the Buildings or the Premises.

  

  

Section 22.02. (a) Subject to Landlord's rights pursuant to Section 22.01
above, to the extent that any Landlord-owned Joint Use Facilities or Landlord-
owned Designated Equipment are not, or are no longer, used for generation
operations and such Landlord-owned Joint Use Facilities or Landlord-owned
Designated Equipment either interfere with Tenant's remaining generation
operations or subject Tenant to increased regulatory or compliance
requirements, Tenant shall have the right to request that such Landlord-owned
Joint Use Facilities or Landlord-owned Designated Equipment be relocated
within the Premises, or, if necessary to preserve Tenant's generation
operations, to request that such Landlord-owned Joint Use Facilities or
Landlord-owned Designated Equipment be removed from the portions of the
Premises outside the Landlord Property. Landlord agrees that, upon receipt of
such request, it will relocate or move such Landlord-owned Joint Use
Facilities or Landlord-owned Designated Equipment at Tenant's sole cost and
expense, as promptly as practicable, but in any event so that such Landlord-
owned Joint Use Facilities or Landlord-owned Designated Equipment is
disconnected and disabled within twelve (12) months and removed or relocated
within twenty-four (24) months, in each case measured from the date of such
request. Tenant agrees to cooperate in any such relocation or removal.

  

  

(b) To the extent that any Tenant-owned Joint Use Facilities or Tenant-owned
Designated Equipment located on Landlord Property are not, or are no longer,
used for generation operations and such Tenant-owned Joint Use Facilities or
Tenant-owned Designated Equipment interfere with Landlord's operations,
Landlord shall have the right to request that such Tenant-owned Joint Use
Facilities or Tenant-owned Designated Equipment be relocated outside the
Landlord Property. Tenant agrees that, upon receipt of such request, it will
relocate or remove such Tenant-owned Joint Use Facilities or Tenant-owned
Designated Equipment, at Landlord's sole cost and expense, as promptly as
practicable, but in any event so that such Tenant-owned Joint Use Facilities
or Tenant-owned Designated Equipment is disconnected and disabled within
twelve (12) months and removed or relocated within twenty-four (24) months, in

each case measured from the date of such request. Landlord agrees to cooperate
in any such relocation or removal.

  

  

ARTICLE 23 
 

  

  

Purchase Option

  

  

Section 23.01. Landlord hereby grants to Tenant an option (the "Option") to
purchase all, but not less than all, of Landlord's full right, title and
interest in and to the Premises, but excluding Landlord Property (the
"Optioned Property"), for a cash payment of one Dollar ($1.00). and the
execution and delivery by Tenant, as owner of the Premises (exclusive of the
Landlord Property) following exercise of the Option, of an easement reasonably
satisfactory to Landlord which provides access and use rights substantially
similar to the rights provided in Section 22.01 (the "Utility Facilities
Easement"). Such option may be exercised at any time upon notice to Landlord
by Tenant, or by a First Leasehold Mortgagee (or its designee) which holds or
is entitled to receive a new lease pursuant to Section 9.03 hereof, and
closing (the "Closing") shall occur thereafter in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 23.01.

  

  

(a) Condition of Title.

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

At the time of Closing, title to the Optioned Property shall be (a) good and
marketable and free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, leases and
tenancies, but subject to the Permitted Exceptions (as hereinafter defined),
and (b) insurable as aforesaid by any reputable title insurance company
selected by Tenant, at standard rates.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

The term "Permitted Exceptions" means (a) liens for real estate taxes, water
and sewer rents that are apportioned hereunder, including special assessments;
(b) an exception for any state of facts or other matters shown on the survey
by ____, dated ____; (c) any and all present and future laws, ordinances,
restrictions, requirements, resolutions, orders, rules and regulations of any
governmental authority, as now or hereafter existing or enforced (including,
without limitation, those related to zoning and land use); (d) easements of
roads; (f) all liens, encumbrances, leases and tenancies existing at the time
of the execution of this Agreement; (e) easements, restrictions, agreements
and like matters of record that do not materially interfere with Tenant's use
of the Optioned Property; and (g) the Utility Facilities Easement.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

Notice of Objection. Within twenty (20) days after Tenant exercises the
Option, Tenant shall obtain a title report and deliver to Landlord written
notice of any liens, encumbrances or other matters which render the condition
of title to the Property other than as required in this Section 23.01. Any
such objections of which Landlord is not notified within such period (except
such liens, encumbrances or other matters as may arise after the date of the
title report obtained by Tenant), shall thereafter be deemed a Permitted
Exception and shall not be raised by Tenant as objections to the condition of
title.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) Subdivision Contingencies.

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

As promptly as practicable after Tenant obtains a survey of the Optioned
Property to be acquired, Tenant shall make application to the applicable
jurisdiction to obtain subdivision of the Optioned Property, which the parties
understand and agree may include a determination of non-conforming use status
from the applicable jurisdiction to enable Tenant to continue to use the
Optioned Property for an electric generating facility and accessory uses, and
the Tenant shall make application for all other permits, variances and other
subdivision approvals including any zoning variances or approvals which are
required from the applicable jurisdiction to enable Tenant to acquire in fee
simple , the Optioned Property, as soon thereafter as is commercially
reasonable ("Tenant Approvals"). Tenant shall be responsible for making
application for the Tenant Approvals and for all fees, costs and expenses
associated therewith, and Tenant shall use commercially reasonable diligence
in filing and processing its applications for Tenant Approvals. Tenant shall
provide Landlord with copies of all filings and applications, and all plans
and studies related to the filings and applications. Landlord shall cooperate
with Tenant (at Tenant's expense) by executing such plans, applications, and
submissions, of whatever kind and/or nature that may be required in connection
with the Tenant Approvals, affirmatively support Tenant in securing the Tenant
Approvals, and if requested by Tenant, a knowledgeable representative of the
Landlord shall attend all meetings with public officials and all public
hearings in connection with the Tenant Approvals. Tenant's obligation to
complete Closing on the exercise of the Option is contingent upon Tenant
obtaining all of the Tenant Approvals, and upon all of the Tenant Approvals,
as well as any necessary Required Landlord Regulatory Approvals (as defined
below), being final and not appealable or subject to challenge under
applicable Legal Requirements.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

If Landlord determines in its sole discretion that the transfer to Tenant of
Landlord's full right, title and interest in the Optioned Property (the
"Property Transfer") requires the consent or approval of or any notice to or
filing with (each a "Required Landlord Regulatory Approval"), any government,
quasi-governmental authority, court, tribunal, arbitrator, authority,
regulatory body, agency, commission, official or other instrumentality or any
city or other political subdivision exercising executive, legislative or
judicial authority (a "Governmental or Regulatory Authority"), Landlord shall,
as soon a reasonably practicable following the receipt of Tenant's notice of
exercise of the Option, prepare and submit to each relevant Governmental or
Regulatory Authority all such notices and filings as are required to obtain
the Required Landlord Regulatory Approvals, and thereafter shall use
reasonably diligent efforts to obtain each Required Landlord Regulatory
Approval. Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord for all of its costs and
expenses incurred in obtaining the Required Landlord Regulatory Approvals
(including, without limitation,

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

the fees and disbursements of legal counsel and consultants retained in
connection therewith ("Regulatory Approval Costs"). Notwithstanding any other
provision of Agreement, the obligation of Landlord to effect the Property
Transfer is conditioned on the receipt by Landlord of each Required Landlord
Regulatory Approval, that in each case (i) does not impose on the Landlord, or
its businesses, operations or activities, any conditions or limitations that
Landlord (in its reasonable discretion) considers unreasonably burdensome and
(ii) except with respect to the environmental indemnifies, if any, required by
Section 6.07, does not impose any costs or financial restrictions (other than
of a de minimis amount) on Landlord for which Landlord is not reimbursed or
indemnified in full by Tenant to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord.

  

  

    

  |  

(iii)

  |  

Tenant may nullify the exercise of this Option at any time before Closing by
providing written notice of same to Landlord, in which event this Lease shall
remain in full force and effect, and neither party shall have any further
liability to the other based upon Tenant's exercise of this Option, except for
the obligation of Tenant to reimburse Landlord's costs, including, without
limitation, all of the Regulatory Approval Costs incurred in connection with
such exercise. For avoidance of doubt, Tenant's nullification shall neither
impair its right to exercise the Option again, nor its right to nullify the
same.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(iv)

  |  

The parties agree to close on the purchase of the Optioned Property on a
mutually agreed date that is no earlier than sixty (60) days after the receipt
by Landlord of Tenant's notice of exercise or, if later, twenty (20) days
after the Tenant Approvals and the Required Landlord Regulatory Approvals have
been obtained.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(v)

  |  

Landlord shall further enter into such appurtenant easements and agreements as
may be reasonably necessary to enable Tenant to continue to utilize Landlord's
adjacent property in the manner contemplated hereby (including the continued
use of any Joint Use Facilities), it being the intention of the parties that
such rights not merge with the deed to the fee and that any rights granted
hereunder should continue in full force and effect so as to enable Tenant the
full continued use and enjoyment of the Landlord's adjacent property for
access, utilities, and the like as provided herein. One agreed form of
Appurtenant Easement is attached hereto and made part hereof as Schedule "E".

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(vi)

  |  

Tenant shall further enter into such appurtenant easements and agreements
(including, without limitation, in the form attached as Schedule "E") as may
be reasonably necessary to enable Landlord to continue to utilize the Landlord
Property in the manner contemplated hereby, it being the intention of the
parties that such rights not merge with the deed to the fee, and that any
rights granted hereunder should continue in full force and effect so as to
enable Tenant the full continued use and enjoyment of the

Landlord's adjacent property for access, utilities, and the like as provided
therein.

  

  

    

  |  

(c)

  |  

Provisions with Respect to Closing. At Closing:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(i) Landlord shall deliver a special warranty deed for the Optioned Property
and associated appurtenant easements as contemplated hereby, duly executed and
acknowledged and in proper form for recording; and such additional
documentation (including affidavits) as may be reasonably requested by Tenant
or Tenant's title company to issue and deliver its title policy.

  


 

  

(ii) Tenant shall execute and deliver the Utility Facilities Easement and
shall pay Landlord the purchase price (i.e., one Dollar ($1.00)). All realty
transfer taxes shall be paid by Tenant.

  

  

(iii) Costs of recording and notary fees shall be paid by Tenant.

  

  

(iv) Except as otherwise provided in Section 23.01(b), Landlord and Tenant
shall be responsible for the fees of their respective legal counsel.

  

  

(v) Tender of an executed deed and purchase money is hereby waived.

  

  

    

  |  

(d)

  |  

Rule Against Perpetuities Savings Clause.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

If the Rule Against Perpetuities or any similar rule of law would invalidate
all or any portion of the option rights granted under this Agreement, or would
limit the time during which the rights granted in this Agreement shall be
effective due to the potential failure of any interest in property created in
this Agreement to vest within a particular time, then each such interest in
property created in this Agreement shall be effective only from the date
hereof until the passing of twenty (20) years after the death of the last
survivor of the grandchildren of current Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,
but each such interest in property shall be extinguished after such time, and
all other interests in property created in this Lease and all other provisions
hereof shall remain valid and effective without modification.

  

  

ARTICLE 24 
 

  

  

Miscellaneous Provisions

  

  

Section 24.01. If any provision of this Lease or the application thereof to
any person or circumstances shall, to any extent, be invalid of unenforceable,

unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each provision of this Lease
shall be valid and be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

any proceeding commenced by Landlord for nonpayment of the rent or additional

28  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Section 24.03. The failure of Landlord or Tenant to complain of any act or
omission on the part of the other party or to take any action in response to
such act or omission, no matter how long the same may continue, shall not be
deemed to be a waiver by said party of any of its rights hereunder. No waiver
by Landlord or Tenant at any time, express or implied, of any breach of any
provision of this Lease shall be deemed a waiver of a subsequent similar
breach or a different breach of any provision of this Lease or a consent to
any subsequent breach of the same or any other provision.

  

  

Section 24.04. This Lease constitutes the entire agreement of the parties
hereto and may not be changed orally but only by an agreement in writing
signed by the party against whom enforcement of any waiver, change,

Lease shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and

leasehold estate, as well as the fee estate in the Premises or any interest in
such fee estate.

  

  

Section 24.07. This Lease shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey.

that in connection with any Use by Grantee hereunder, at Grantee's expense and
only if such adding to, relocation or expansion would not, as determined by
Grantor in its reasonable discretion, unreasonably or materially burden
Grantor's Property or otherwise materially damage Grantor's Property or
materially impede the Grantor's performance of its obligation under the ICA or
the operation of its business affected by the easements, licenses and rights
created hereby and in connection with any Use by Grantor hereunder,at
Grantor's expense and only if such adding to, relocation or expansion would
not, as determined by Grantee in its reasonable discretion, unreasonably or
materially burden the Generation Facilities Easement Area or otherwise
materially damage the Generation Facilities Easement Area or materially impede
the Grantee's performance of its obligation under the ICA or the operation of
its business affected by the reservations, easements, licenses and rights
created hereby. If Grantor determines that a proposed Use by Grantee which
constitutes an addition, relocation or expansion would unreasonably or
materially burden Grantor's Property or otherwise materially impede the
exercise by Grantor of any right granted or reserved hereunder and/or
operations of Grantor, both in the then-present or in the future, then Grantor
shall promptly so notify Grantee and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith
to find and implement an acceptable alternative for such proposed Use. If
Grantee determines that a proposed Use by Grantor which constitutes an
addition, relocation or expansion would unreasonably or materially burden the
Generation Facilities Easement Area or otherwise materially impede the
exercise by Grantee of any right granted or reserved hereunder and/or
operations of Grantee, both in the then-present or in the future, then Grantee
shall promptly so notify Grantor and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith
to find and implement an acceptable alternative for such proposed Use. In no
event shall the Use by either Party impair the future Use by the other Party
of such other Party's property in a manner permitted by applicable zoning and
other land use regulations without obtaining any additional variances, special
exceptions, or other form of special use permits, nor impede such other
Party's ability to freely transfer its interest in and to such property.
Without limitation of the foregoing, any such use by a Party shall include its
right to install its interconnection equipment within or outside the
Generation Facilities Easement Area as reasonably required to implement the
interconnection contemplated under the ICA, including without limitation, the
right to "connect to" or "mount upon" the other Party's equipment or
facilities.

Default" under this Agreement, (a) if the defaulting Party fails to make any
payment due from such defaulting Party to the non-defaulting Party within
twenty (20) days after written demand for such payment, (b) if the defaulting
Party fails, within twenty (20) days after written notice from the non-

monetary obligations hereunder, and said defaulting Party fails to cure such
default within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from the non-
defaulting Party stating with particularity the nature of the default;
provided however, if such default is of such a nature that it cannot be cured
within thirty (30) days following receipt of such notice, an Event of Default
shall not have occurred if the defaulting Party shall within such thirty (30)
day period commence the necessary cure and shall at all times thereafter
diligently and continuously prosecute such cure to completion.

  

  

6.2 Right of Self Help.

  

  

The non-defaulting Party may at its election, following the occurrence of a
non-monetary Event of Default and the thirtieth (30th) day after the receipt
of the written notice specified in clause 6.1 (c) hereof, undertake the cure
of such default on behalf of the defaulting Party. The non-defaulting Party is
granted a license to enter upon, through, or under the property or
improve­ments of the defaulting Party to effect such cure. Following
occurrence of an Event of Default involving the non-payment of money to a
person or entity not a Party to this Agreement, the non-defaulting Party may

non-defaulting Party and all reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by it in effecting such cure or payment
as provided for in this Section 6.2, shall be paid by the defaulting Party

proceedings against the

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

defaulting Party either to specifically enforce, restrain, or enjoin the
violation of any restriction, covenant, condition, agreement, term,
representation, or warranty herein contained or to recover damages.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is understood and
agreed that the remedies permitted pursuant to this Agreement other than
equitable remedies may be inadequate in the case of any breach by either Party
of its obligations contained herein. Accordingly, each Party agrees that in
such instances, the affected Party shall be entitled to preliminary injunctive
relief from a court of competent jurisdiction.

  

  

6.5 No Extinguishment, Termination or Forfeiture.

  

  

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall create any reversion, condition, or
right of re-entry or other provisions for extinguishment, termination or
forfeiture under which either Party can be cut off, subordinated, or otherwise
disturbed in the possession of its property. Grantor's remedies for default by
Grantee hereunder shall not include termination, extinguishment or forfeiture
of this Agreement or Grantee's rights hereunder.

  

  

6.6 Independent Covenants.

  

  

None of the rights and easements granted by this Agreement and none of the
per­formances required by this Agreement shall be dependent on the performance
of any other term, promise, or condition of this Agreement or any documents
executed concurrently or in connection with this Agreement, and such rights,
easements and requirements of performance shall continue in effect
irrespective of whether anything else in this Agreement or such other
documents has been breached or has been terminated. The separateness and
independent survival of the rights, easements, and requirements of performance
under this Agreement are essential terms hereof without which this Agreement
would not have been made.

8.16 Recording.

  

  

The Parties agree to execute and record this Agreement or instead, at the
request of either Party, a short-form memorandum thereof in the office of the
Recorder of Deeds for [____]. The Grantee shall pay the recording costs.

  

  

8.17 Purchase Option.

  

  

Grantor hereby grants to Grantee an option (the "Option") to purchase all, but
not less than all, of Grantor's full right, title and interest in the
Generation Facilities Easement Area (the "Optioned Property") for a cash
payment of one Dollar ($1.00) and the execution and delivery by Grantee, as
owner of the property constituting the Generation Facilities Easement Area
following exercise of the Option, of an easement to Grantor substantially in
the form attached as Exhibit F hereto (the "ICA Easement"). Such option may be
exercised at any time upon notice to Grantor. The closing (the "Closing")
shall occur thereafter in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.17.

  

  

(a) Condition of Title.

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

At the time of Closing, title to the Optioned Property shall be (a) good and
marketable and free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, leases and
tenancies, but subject to the Permitted Exceptions (as hereinafter defined),
and (b) insurable as aforesaid by any reputable title insurance company
selected by Grantee, at standard rates.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

The term "Permitted Exceptions" means (a) liens for real estate taxes, water
and sewer rents that are apportioned hereunder, including special assessments;
(b) an exception for any state of facts or other matters shown on the survey
by ____, dated ____; (c) any and all present and future laws, ordinances,
restrictions, requirements, resolutions, orders, rules and regulations of any
governmental authority, as now or hereafter existing or enforced (including,
without limitation, those related to zoning and land use); (d) easements of
roads; (e) all liens, encumbrances, leases and tenancies existing at the time
of the execution of this Agreement; (f) easements, restrictions, agreements
and like matters of record that do not materially interfere with Grantee's use
of the Optioned Property and (g) the easement identified in the introductory
paragraph of this Section 8.17.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

Notice of Objection. Within twenty (20) days after Grantee exercises the
Option, Grantee shall obtain a title report and deliver to Grantor written
notice of any liens, encum­brances or other matters which render the condition
of title to the Property other than as required

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

in this Section 8.17. Any such objections of which Grantor is not notified
within such period (except such liens, encumbrances or other matters as may
arise after the date of the title report obtained by Grantee), shall
thereafter be deemed a Permitted Exception and shall not be raised by Grantee
as objections to the condition of title.

  

  

(b) Subdivision Contingencies.

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

As promptly as practicable after Grantee obtains a survey of the Optioned
Property, Grantee shall make application to the applicable jurisdiction to
obtain subdivision of the Optioned Property, which the parties understand and
agree may include a determination of non-conforming use status from the
applicable jurisdiction to enable Grantee to continue to use the Optioned
Property for an electric generating facility and accessory uses, and the
Grantee shall make application for all other permits, variances and other
subdivision approvals including any zoning variances or approvals, that are
required to be obtained from the applicable jurisdiction to enable Grantee to
acquire in fee simple the Generating Facilities Easement Area as soon
thereafter as is commercially reasonable (the "Grantee Approvals"). Grantee
shall be responsible for making application for the Grantee Approvals and for
all fees, costs and expenses associated therewith, and Grantee shall use
commercially reasonable diligence in filing and processing its applications
for Grantee Approvals. Grantee shall provide Grantor with copies of all
filings and applications, and all plans and studies related to the filings and
applications. Grantor shall cooperate with Grantee (at Grantee's expense) by
executing such plans, applications, and submissions, of whatever kind and/or
nature that may be required in connection with the Grantee Approvals,
affirmatively support Grantee in securing the Grantee Approvals, and if
requested by Grantee, a knowledgeable representative of the Grantor shall
attend all meetings with public officials and all public hearings in
connection with the Grantee Approvals. Grantee's obligation to complete
Closing on the exercise of the Option is contingent upon Grantee obtaining all
of the Grantee Approvals and upon all of the Grantee Approvals, as well as any
necessary Required Grantor Regulatory Approvals (as defined below) , being
final and not appealable or subject to challenge under applicable law.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

If Grantor determines in its sole discretion that the transfer to Grantee of
Grantor's full right, title and interest in the Optioned Property (the
"Property Transfer") requires the consent or approval of or any notice to or
filing with (each a "Required Grantor Regulatory Approval"), any government,
quasi-governmental authority, court, tribunal, arbitrator, authority,
regulatory body, agency, commission, official or other instrumentality or any
city or other political subdivision exercising executive, legislative or
judicial authority (a "Governmental or Regulatory Authority"), Grantor shall,
as soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt of Grantee's notice of
exercise of the Option, prepare and submit to each relevant Governmental or
Regulatory Authority all such notices

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

and filings as are required to obtain the Required Grantor Regulatory
Approvals, and thereafter shall use reasonably diligent efforts to obtain each
Required Grantor Regulatory Approval. Grantee agrees to reimburse Grantor for
all of its costs and expenses incurred in obtaining the Required Grantor
Regulatory Approvals (including, without limitation, the fees and
disbursements of legal counsel and consultants retained in connection
therewith ("Regulatory Approval Costs"). Notwithstanding any other provision
of Agreement, the obligation of Grantor to effect the Property Transfer is
conditioned on the receipt by Grantor of each Required Grantor Regulatory
Approval, which in each case (i) does not impose on the Grantor, or its
businesses, operations or activities, any conditions or limitations that
Grantor (in the exercise of its reasonable discretion) considers unreasonably
burdensome and (ii) except with respect to the environmental indemnities, if
any, required by Section 7.1, does not impose any costs or financial
restrictions (other than of a de mininus amount) on Grantor for which Grantor
is not reimbursed or indemnified in full by Grantee to the reasonable
satisfaction of Grantor.

  

  

    

  |  

(iii)

  |  

Grantee may nullify the exercise of this Option at any time before Closing by
providing written notice of same to Grantor, in which event this Easement
shall remain in full force and effect, and neither party shall have any
further liability to the other based upon Grantee's exercise of this Option,
except for the obligation of Grantee to reimburse Grantor's costs, including,
without limitation, all of the Regulatory Approval Costs incurred in
connection with such exercise. For avoidance of doubt, Grantee's nullification
shall neither impair its right to exercise the Option again, nor its right to
nullify the same.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(iv)

  |  

The parties agree to close on the purchase of the Optioned Property on a
mutually agreed date that is no earlier than sixty (60) days after the receipt
by the Grantor of Grantee's notice of exercise or, if later, twenty (20) days
after the receipt of the last to be obtained of the Grantee Approvals and the
Required Grantor Regulatory Approvals.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(v)

  |  

Grantor shall further enter into such appurtenant easements and agree­ments as
may be reasonably necessary to enable Grantee to continue to utilize Grantor's
adjacent property in the manner contemplated hereby (including the continued
use of any Joint Facilities), it being the intention of the parties that such
rights not merge with the deed to the fee, and that any rights granted
hereunder should continue in full force and effect so as to enable Grantee the
full continued use and enjoyment of the Grantor's adjacent property for
access, utilities, and the like as provided herein. One agreed form of
Appurtenant Easement is attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit F.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(vi)

  |  

Grantee shall further enter into such appurtenant easements and agree­ments as
may be reasonably necessary to enable Grantor to continue to

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

utilize the Optioned Property in the manner contemplated hereby (including the
continued use of any Joint Facilities), it being the intention of the parties
that such rights not merge with the deed to the fee, and that any rights
granted hereunder should continue in full force and effect so as to enable
Grantor the full continued use and enjoyment of the Optioned Property for
access, utilities, and the like as provided herein.

  

  

(c) Provisions with Respect to Closing. At Closing:

  

  

     |  

(i)

  |  

Grantor shall deliver a special warranty deed for the Optioned Property and
associated appurtenant easements as contemplated hereby, duly executed and
acknowledged and in proper form for recording; and such additional
documentation (including affidavits) as may be reasonably requested by Grantee
or Grantee's title company to issue and deliver its title policy.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(ii)

  |  

Grantee shall execute and deliver the ICA Easement, if required, and shall pay
Grantor the purchase price (i.e., one Dollar ($1.00)). This Easement shall be
amended to delete the provisions hereof relating to the exclusive easement in
favor of Grantee with respect to the Generation Facilities Easement Area, but
retaining the other Access and Use rights granted to Grantee hereunder All
realty transfer taxes shall be paid by Grantee.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(iii)

  |  

Costs of recording and notary fees shall be paid by Grantee.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(iv)

  |  

Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.17(b), Grantor and Grantee shall be
responsible for the fees of their respective legal counsel.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(v)

  |  

Tender of an executed deed and purchase money is hereby waived.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(d)

  |  

Rule Against Perpetuities Savings Clause.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

If the Rule Against Perpetuities or any similar rule of law would invalidate
all or any portion of the option rights granted under this Agreement, or would
limit the time during which the rights granted in this Agreement shall be
effective due to the potential failure of any interest in property created in
this Agreement to vest within a particular time, then each such interest in
property created in this Agreement shall be effective only from the date
hereof until the passing of twenty (20) years after the death of the last
survivor of the grandchildren of current Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,
but each such interest in property shall be extinguished after such time, and
all other interests in property created in this Easement and all other
provisions hereof shall remain valid and effective without modification.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

8.18 Grantor Certification.

  

  

Grantor hereby certifies that the actual monetary consideration paid for this
Agreement is ten Dollars ($10.00).

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the date
first above written.

Each Party shall comply with the following rules and conditions with respect
to any construction or other work carried out (i) within any easement area,
(ii) pursuant to any reservation, (iii) in exercise of any right, privilege or
license, or (iv) with respect to any activities including blasting, regardless
of where such activities are carried out, that are reasonably capable of
damaging the property of the other Party hereto.

  

  

1. A Party undertaking any such construction or other work shall be fully liable to the other Party for any damage done to the property of such other Party.

  

  

2. All equipment Used in connection with any such construction or other work shall maintain a minimum clearance from electrical wires as specified by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 ("OSHA"), 29 U.S.C. 651 et seq., and its implementing regulations, as amended. Each Party must comply with the clearance requirements of the National Electric Safety Code (ANSI C2), as amended.

  

  

3. Each Party acknowledges that induced voltage may occur during construction, operation, or maintenance due to the proximity to electric facilities. Each Party shall install appropriate grounding to protect its equipment and facilities.

  

  

4. Except in case of an emergency, a Party shall prior to:

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

conducting any excavation that is reasonably capable of damaging the property
of the other Party hereto provide at least ten (10) days advance written
notice to such Party to permit such Party, if it so elects, to have a
representative present during such work;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

performing any blasting, or other activity (other than excavation), that is
reasonably capable of damaging the property of the other Party, provide to
such other Party a detailed proposal setting forth the extent of the blasting,
or such other activity, and the measures to be taken to protect the facilities
of such other Party. No blasting or other activity contemplated by the
preceding sentence shall occur until the other Party shall have reviewed and
provided its written approval for such blasting or other activity, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

5. Each Party, at its sole expense, shall provide the other Party with an as-built survey of any facilities installed by it pursuant to these Construction and Work Rules within thirty (30) days following completion of the installation of the facilities.

EXHIBIT E

  

  

ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS and REMEDIATION WORK

  

  

Grantor and Grantee's rights and easements set forth in this Agreement shall
include the rights and be subject to the conditions set forth in this Exhibit
E. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Exhibit E shall
govern all Remedial Activities (as that term is defined below) conducted by
either Grantor and or the Grantee within the Grantee's Easement Areas, and any
Remedial Activities conducted by the Grantee on any other Grantor Property
pursuant to Section 2.5 (b) (such affected portions of the Grantee's Easement
Areas and the Grantor's Property being hereinafter collectively referred to as
the "Remedial Easement Areas"), but otherwise shall not apply to Remedial
Activities at the Grantor's Property.

  

  

(a) All rights and easements granted to the Grantee or reserved by Grantor
under this Agreement shall include the right to enter upon, utilize, excavate,
travel over, alter, improve, and occupy the Remedial Easement Areas for the
sole purpose of conducting (i) soil sampling, groundwater sampling, and other
investigations, assessments, and tests related to the environmental condition
of such Remedial Easement Areas, including invasive testing, and the
construction of test wells and monitoring devices (temporary or permanent),
and (ii) necessary, related, or resulting excavation, construction, removal
work, remedial work, corrective actions and response actions and other
ancillary activities and work, including the construction and installation of
temporary and permanent remedial devices ((i) and (ii) hereinafter
collectively referred to as "Remedial Activities"). Except to the extent
required by Environmental Laws such Remedial Activities shall not unreasonably
interfere with Grantor's or the Grantee's use of the Remedial Easement Areas.
These rights and easements are granted for the accommodation of the applicable
Party's officers, employees, agents, consultants, contractors, subcontractors
and invitees as well as construction and other equipment, vehicles, materials,
excavated earth, tools, accessories, and other necessary items required for
the proper performance of such Remedial Activities at the Remedial Easement
Areas.

  

  

(b) The Grantee and Grantor each shall provide the other Party with split
samples of all sampled media within Remedial Easement Areas if the other Party
agrees to bear any additional cost of providing such split samples.

  

  

(c) Except as provided in the following sentence, prior to conducting any
Remedial Activities within the Remedial Easement Areas, a Party shall (i)
first furnish the other Party with a work plan which, among other things,
identifies the number and general location of any planned borings, wells,
piezometers or other monitoring or remedial devices and the analysis which the
Party plans to perform, and/or the anticipated scope and timing of any
Remedial Activities; and (ii) provide the other Party at least ten (10) days
advance written notice, but once a Party provides to the other Party a
schedule of investigative activities, no further notice will be required so
long as the schedule is adhered to. Each Party waives these requirements for
any spills, leaks, or other exposures which, in the other Party's reasonable
judgment, requires immediate action, but such other Party shall nevertheless
provide the other Party with reasonable notice and written work plan as
available.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

(d) Unless required by Environmental Laws, the Grantee agrees that it will not
disclose the results of any testing or analysis Grantee performs on soil,
groundwater, and air samples taken from the Grantee's Easement Areas, without
first disclosing the results to the Grantor and giving the Grantor a
reasonable opportunity to disclose the results itself or jointly with the
Grantee. Unless required by Environmental Laws, the Grantee agrees that it
will not disclose the results of any testing or analysis performed by or for
it on soil, groundwater, and air samples taken from Remedial Easement Areas
that are not within a Grantee's Easement Area. Unless required by
Environmental Laws, the Grantor shall not disclose the results of any testing
or analysis Grantor performs on soil, groundwater, and air samples taken from
the Grantee's Easement Areas without first disclosing the results to the
Grantee and giving the Grantee a reasonable opportunity to disclose the
results itself or jointly with the Grantor.

  

  

(e) Each Party agrees to promptly furnish the other Party with a copy of any
and all data and reports resulting from any environmental testing or analysis
performed by such Party on soil, groundwater, and air samples from the
Remedial Easement Areas.

  

  

(f) Each Party shall promptly remove, or cause to be removed, from the
Remedial Easement Areas, all debris, surplus material, waste or waste
containers, devices and equipment placed thereon by such Party when no longer
actually needed for the conduct of the Remedial Activities permitted
hereunder, and shall restore the affected portions of the Remedial Easement
Areas to substantially their condition before the conduct of such Remedial
Activities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party shall be permitted to
leave in place any monitoring, testing, or remedial devices which it installed
and which it is required to maintain in order to comply with any Environmental
Laws, or to achieve the goals of the Remedial Activities.

  

  

(g) Except as required by Environmental Laws or as otherwise provided herein,
any fencing, equipment, and other materials to be utilized, operated,
installed, or situated within the Remedial Easement Areas shall be situated
such that they do not unreasonably interfere with the Grantee's or the
Grantor's operations, and only after notice to the other Party. Any
obstruction required for the performance of work on Remedial Easement Areas
shall be temporary only and shall be removed by the installing Party, as soon
as practicable following the completion of the activity requiring such
obstruction.

10.3 General Scope of Easements.

  

  

     |  

(a)

  |  

Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.3(b), each easement and each right,
privilege and license granted hereby is and shall be a grant, transfer,
conveyance, and right of Use (subject to the terms of this Agreement) to
Grantee thereof and to any successor or assign of Grantee under this Agreement
and in and to the Designated Grantee Equipment. All easements granted herein
are granted in perpetuity, are irrevocable and non-terminable to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, and shall be covenants running with the
land and Grantor's Property, binding upon and benefiting in accordance
herewith, the Parties, their successors and assigns.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

Any easement or right, privilege or license granted hereunder for purposes of
enabling Grantee to exercise any right or fulfill any obligation set forth in
the ICA will last for the term of the ICA, and will continue thereafter only
if the right or obligation (i) shall by its express terms survive the
termination or expiration of the ICA or (ii) is necessary for the conduct of
the business of transmitting and/or distributing electric power by Grantee.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(c)

  |  

All Grantee equipment and facilities currently located on the Grantor's
Property, or hereafter installed and maintained therein pursuant to an
easement or right, privilege or license granted hereunder shall be maintained
by Grantee in a good and safe manner and Grantee shall make all repairs and
replacements reasonably necessary to keep such equipment and facilities in
good condition.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(d)

  |  

Grantee may not enter upon or Use or permit others to enter upon or Use
Grantor's Property in any manner or for any purpose other than as expressly
permitted by Section 2.1 hereof.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(e)

  |  

"Use" or "Used", as the context dictates, shall mean, with respect to all
easements, rights, privileges and licenses granted or reserved hereunder, to

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

operate, maintain, repair, upgrade, clean, test, install, add to, alter,
remove, inspect, construct, modify, restore, rebuild, replace, relocate and
expand; provided, that in connection with any Use by Grantee hereunder, at
Grantee's expense and only if such adding to, relocation or expansion would
not, as determined by Grantor in its reasonable discretion, unreasonably or
materially burden Grantor's Property or otherwise materially damage Grantor's
Property or materially impede the Grantor's performance of its obligations
under the ICA or the operation of its generation business and rights created
hereby. If Grantor determines that a proposed Use by Grantee which constitutes
an addition, relocation or expansion would unreasonably or materially burden
Grantor's Property or otherwise materially impede the exercise by Grantor of
any right granted or reserved hereunder and/or operations of Grantor, both in
the then-present or in the future, then Grantor shall promptly so notify
Grantee and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to find and implement an
acceptable alternative for such proposed Use. In no event shall the Use by
Grantee impair the future Use by Grantor of Grantor's property in a manner
permitted by applicable zoning and other land use regulations without
obtaining any additional variances, special exceptions, or other form of
special use permits, nor impede Grantor's ability to freely transfer its
interest in and to such property. Without limitation of the foregoing, any
such use by Grantee shall include its right to install its interconnection
equipment as reasonably required to implement the interconnection contemplated
under the ICA, including without limitation, the right to "connect to" or
"mount upon" the Grantor's equipment or facilities.

  

  

10.4 Interpretation.

  

  

The following shall apply in interpreting any easement and any right,
privilege or license granted pursuant to this Agreement:

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |

improve­ments of the defaulting Party to effect such cure. Following

agreement, term, representation, or warranty herein contained or to recover
damages. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is
understood and agreed that the remedies permitted pursuant to this Agreement

Grantee hereunder shall not include termination, extinguishment or forfeiture
of this Agreement or Grantee's rights hereunder.

  

  

14.6 Independent Covenants.

  

  

None of the rights and easements granted by this Agreement and none of the
per­formances required by this Agreement shall be dependent on the performance
of any other term, promise, or condition of this Agreement or any documents
executed concurrently or in connection with this Agreement, and such rights,
easements and requirements of performance shall continue in effect
irrespective of whether anything else in this Agreement or such other
documents has been breached or has been terminated. The separateness and
independent survival of the rights, easements, and requirements of performance
under this Agreement are essential terms hereof without which this Agreement
would not have been made.

subject of indemnification hereunder without the prior consent of the other
Party; provided, however, that said consent shall not be unreasonably

ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS and REMEDIATION WORK

  

  

Grantor and Grantee's rights and easements set forth in this Agreement shall
include the rights and be subject to the conditions set forth in this Exhibit
E. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Exhibit E shall
govern all Remedial Activities (as that term is defined below) conducted by
either Grantor and or the Grantee within the Grantee's Easement Areas, and any
Remedial Activities conducted by the Grantee on any other Grantor Property
pursuant to Section 2.5 (b) (such affected portions of the Grantee's Easement
Areas and the Grantor's Property being hereinafter collectively referred to as
the "Remedial Easement Areas"), but otherwise shall not apply to Remedial
Activities at the Grantor's Property.

  

  

(a) All rights and easements granted to the Grantee or reserved by Grantor
under this Agreement shall include the right to enter upon, utilize, excavate,
travel over, alter, improve, and occupy the Remedial Easement Areas for the
sole purpose of conducting (i) soil sampling, groundwater sampling, and other
investigations, assessments, and tests related to the environmental condition
of such Remedial Easement Areas, including invasive testing, and the
construction of test wells and monitoring devices (temporary or permanent),
and (ii) necessary, related, or resulting excavation, construction, removal
work, remedial work, corrective actions and response actions and other
ancillary activities and work, including the construction and installation of
temporary and permanent remedial devices ((i) and (ii) hereinafter
collectively referred to as "Remedial Activities"). Except to the extent
required by Environmental Laws such Remedial Activities shall not unreasonably
interfere with Grantor's or the Grantee's use of the Remedial Easement Areas.
These rights and easements are granted for the accommodation of the applicable
Party's officers, employees, agents, consultants, contractors, subcontractors
and invitees as well as construction and other equipment, vehicles, materials,
excavated earth, tools, accessories, and other necessary items required for
the proper performance of such Remedial Activities at the Remedial Easement
Areas.

  

  

(b) The Grantee and Grantor each shall provide the other Party with split
samples of all sampled media within Remedial Easement Areas if the other Party
agrees to bear any additional cost of providing such split samples.

  

  

(c) Except as provided in the following sentence, prior to conducting any
Remedial Activities within the Remedial Easement Areas, a Party shall (i)
first furnish the other Party with a work plan which, among other things,
identifies the number and general location of any planned borings, wells,
piezometers or other monitoring or remedial devices and the analysis which the
Party plans to perform, and/or the anticipated scope and timing of any
Remedial Activities; and (ii) provide the other Party at least ten (10) days
advance written notice, but once a Party provides to the other Party a
schedule of investigative activities, no further notice will be required so
long as the schedule is adhered to. Each Party waives these requirements for
any spills, leaks, or other exposures which, in the other Party's reasonable
judgment, requires immediate action, but such other Party shall nevertheless
provide the other Party with reasonable notice and written work plan as
available.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

(d) Unless required by Environmental Laws, the Grantee agrees that it will not
disclose the results of any testing or analysis Grantee performs on soil,
groundwater, and air samples taken from the Grantee's Easement Areas, without
first disclosing the results to the Grantor and giving the Grantor a
reasonable opportunity to disclose the results itself or jointly with the
Grantee. Unless required by Environmental Laws, the Grantee agrees that it
will not disclose the results of any testing or analysis performed by or for
it on soil, groundwater, and air samples taken from Remedial Easement Areas
that are not within a Grantee's Easement Area. Unless required by
Environmental Laws, the Grantor shall not disclose the results of any testing
or analysis Grantor performs on soil, groundwater, and air samples taken from
the Grantee's Easement Areas without first disclosing the results to the
Grantee and giving the Grantee a reasonable opportunity to disclose the
results itself or jointly with the Grantor.

  

  

(e) Each Party agrees to promptly furnish the other Party with a copy of any
and all data and reports resulting from any environmental testing or analysis
performed by such Party on soil, groundwater, and air samples from the
Remedial Easement Areas.

  

  

(f) Each Party shall promptly remove, or cause to be removed, from the
Remedial Easement Areas, all debris, surplus material, waste or waste
containers, devices and equipment placed thereon by such Party when no longer
actually needed for the conduct of the Remedial Activities permitted
hereunder, and shall restore the affected portions of the Remedial Easement
Areas to substantially their condition before the conduct of such Remedial
Activities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party shall be permitted to
leave in place any monitoring, testing, or remedial devices which it installed
and which it is required to maintain in order to comply with any Environmental
Laws, or to achieve the goals of the Remedial Activities.

  

  

(g) Except as required by Environmental Laws or as otherwise provided herein,
any fencing, equipment, and other materials to be utilized, operated,
installed, or situated within the Remedial Easement Areas shall be situated
such that they do not unreasonably interfere with the Grantee's or the
Grantor's operations, and only after notice to the other Party. Any
obstruction required for the performance of work on Remedial Easement Areas
shall be temporary only and shall be removed by the installing Party, as soon
as practicable following the completion of the activity requiring such
obstruction.

FIRST AMENDMENT TO CLAYMONT TO HAY ROAD PIPELINE OWNERS' AGREEMENT (this
"Amendment"), dated as of [•], 2010, by and between Delmarva Power and Light
Company, a Delaware and Virginia corporation ("Delmarva") and Conectiv
Delmarva Generation, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (formerly
Conectiv Delmarva Generation, Inc.) ("CDG"). Delmarva and CDG are each
referred to herein as an "Owner" or a "Party" and collectively as the "Owners"
or the "Parties".

  

  

  

W I T N E S S E T H :

  

  

WHEREAS, on July 1, 2000, CDG and Delmarva entered into that certain Claymont
to Hay Road Pipeline Owners' Agreement (the "Owners' Agreement");

  

  

WHEREAS, CDG is a wholly owned subsidiary of Conectiv Energy Holdings Company,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("CEH"), and CEH is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Conectiv, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Conectiv");

  

  

WHEREAS, Conectiv proposes to sell all of its direct membership interest in
CEH, and its indirect interest in CDG, to New Development Holdings, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Calpine
Corporation (the "Proposed Transaction");

  

  

WHEREAS, in connection with the Proposed Transaction, CDG and Delmarva wish to
evidence their agreement with respect to certain matters as set forth herein.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows.

  

  

  

1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Owners' Agreement.

  

  

  

2. Waivers. Delmarva hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: (i) agrees that the Owners' Agreement shall not terminate as the result of the Proposed Transaction and Delmarva hereby waives any right it may have to terminate the Owners' Agreement, or the effect of any provision of the Owners' Agreement that would purport to cause the Owners' Agreement to terminate, as a result of the Proposed Transaction; (ii) agrees that no "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have occurred under the Owners' Agreement as a result of the Proposed Transaction and Delmarva hereby waives its Call Rights pursuant to Section 6.5 of the Owners' Agreement as they might arise in connection with the Proposed Transaction; and (iii) confirms that the Owners' Agreement shall be in full force and effect following the closing of the Proposed Transaction.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

3. Amendments to the Owners' Agreement.

  

  

  

(a) Section 3.5 is hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows:

  

  

"Section 3.5. Curtailment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary and the fact that neither CDG, nor its rights or
interests in the Pipeline Facilities are subject to regulation by the Delaware
Public Service Commission, in the event of a curtailment of gas service or
other adverse operating condition that may reasonably be expected to impact
the flow of gas to Delmarva's firm customers occurs (a "Curtailment"), the
Delmarva Gas Tariff as approved by the Delaware Public Service Commission, or
any successor thereto, in effect at the time of such Curtailment shall govern
the priorities and procedures of the Owners, including Delmarva's rights to
its capacity usage, in connection with the operation of the Pipeline
Facilities during such Curtailment such that in a Curtailment Delmarva's gas
shall be the "first through the meter" up to its share of the capacity of the
Pipeline Facilities as then in effect. The Parties shall cooperate in good
faith using commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the impact of a
Curtailment on either of them."

  

  

  

(b) The following is hereby added as a new Section 3.7 to the Owners'
Agreement:

  

  

  

"Section 3.7. Capacity Expansion. It is the intent of the Owners to work
cooperatively and in good faith to agree on expansions to the Pipeline
Facilities that meet the objectives of both parties. Wherever the consent or
the cooperation of either Owner is necessary or desirable in connection with a
capacity expansion, that consent or cooperation shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed. In the event an Owner (the "Expansion
Owner") wishes to expand the capacity of the Pipeline Facilities pursuant to
this Section 3.7, the Expansion Owner shall give notice to the other Owner no
less than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the date on which the
Expansion Owner reasonably anticipates the start of construction for such
expansion. Such notice shall provide to the other Owner detailed information
and an opportunity to review and comment regarding the proposed expansion in
advance of undertaking any construction activity. The Parties shall negotiate
in good faith the scope and components of the capacity expansion, the
proportionate allocation of any capacity expansion, and the related allocation
of costs. If the other Owner does not elect to participate in funding its
proportionate share of the cost of any such expansion, the Expansion Owner
shall be entitled to usage of all of the incremental transportation capacity
resulting from such expansion of the Pipeline Facilities, but subject to the
terms of this Agreement. Provided that the Expansion Owner complies with the
terms of this Section 3.7 and Section 4.8, and notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Expansion Owner may from time to time and
at any time expand the capacity of the Pipeline Facilities. With respect to
any expansion, (a) no such expansion shall materially impair the other Owner's
rights or interests with respect to the Pipeline Facilities or the services of
the Operator; (b) the Expansion Owner shall keep the other Owner and the
Operator informed regarding all material activities related to such expansion;
(c) the Expansion Owner shall provide to the other Owner and the Operator in
advance all design and

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-2-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

engineering documents for the other Owner's and the Operator's review and
comment; (d) the Expansion Owner shall coordinate all construction schedules
and outages with the other Owner and the Operator; (d) the Expansion Owner
shall perform or cause its contractors and vendors to perform all work and
provide all services in accordance with applicable Federal, state, and local
law, code, and regulation; and (e) the Expansion Owner shall adhere to the
other Owner's and the Operator's reasonable requirements with respect to any
construction activities associated with a capacity expansion pursuant to this
Section 3.7.

  

  

  

(c) The following is hereby added as a new Section 4.8 to the Owners'
Agreement:

  

  

  

"Section 4.8. Capital Additions; Operating Costs; Incremental Capacity for
Capacity Expansion. In the event that an Owner does not elect to bear a
proportionate share of the cost of any expansion undertaken by the Expansion
Owner pursuant to Section 3.7, (a) the expansion shall be at the Expansion
Owner's sole cost and expense; (b) the Expansion Owner shall be responsible
for reasonable incremental costs to the extent reasonably necessary to improve
the other Owner's facilities to accommodate the expansion and the operation of
the Pipeline Facilities as so expanded, (c) the Expansion Owner shall be
responsible for all reasonable incremental operating costs resulting from the
expansion, and (d) the Expansion Owner's Ownership interest, expressed in
Section 3.1, shall increase in proportion to the increased reliable capacity
of the Pipeline Facilities added by the expansion, and the other Owner's right
to capacity shall decrease in a corresponding proportion but to a level not
less than that prior to giving effect to the expansion. In connection with the
application of Clause (d) above, the Committee, subject to the unanimous
approval of the Owners, shall determine the allocation of ownership interests
in the Pipeline Facilities following the expansion in light of the conditions
and requirements contained in Section 3.7 and this Section 4.8 and the
operating characteristics of the Pipeline Facilities after giving effect to
the capacity expansion. Any deadlock of the Committee resulting by reason of

WHEREAS, in connection with the Proposed Transaction, CDG and Delmarva wish to
evidence their agreement with respect to certain matters as set forth herein.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows.

  

  

1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the OandM Agreement.

  

  

2. Waivers. Delmarva hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: (i) agrees that the OandM Agreement shall not terminate as the result of the Proposed Transaction and Delmarva hereby waives any right it may have to terminate the OandM Agreement, or the effect of any provision of the OandM Agreement that would purport to cause the OandM Agreement to terminate, as a result of the Proposed Transaction; (ii) agrees that no "Change of Control" shall

hereof."

  

  

(b) Section 3.8 shall be amended to read as follows:

maintenance activities by providing written notice to the other Party."

  

  

(c) A new Section 3.9 shall be added as follows:

  

  

"3.9 Other Qualifications of Operator; Default of Operator; Replacement of

(a) In the event the Operator defaults in the performance of any of its
material obligations as Operator under this Agreement, or upon the occurrence
of an Insolvency Event of the Operator, in addition to all other rights and
remedies available to Owner not then acting as Operator (the "Replacement
Operator"), upon not less than thirty days' prior written notice, the
Replacement Operator shall have the right to succeed to the Operator's
interests as the Operator under this Agreement.

  

  

(b) The Operator shall have thirty days following receipt of notice to cure
any default (or such longer period as may be reasonably required to cure the
default, provided that the Operator has promptly commenced and is diligently
acting to cure the default.). Notwithstanding the pendency of any cure period,
the Operator must take all reasonable efforts to ensure that gas may be
received and delivered on the Pipeline Facilities pursuant to this Agreement
pending the completion of any cure. In the event Operator fails to take all
reasonable efforts to ensure that gas is received and delivered under the
previous sentence, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the
Party that is not the Operator shall have the immediate right, upon giving
advance notice that is reasonable under the circumstances, to undertake the
rights and obligations of Operator on an interim basis during the pendency of
any cure period to the extent necessary or prudent to ensure reliable gas flow
on the Pipeline Facilities.

  

  

(c) As a condition to being the Operator, Delmarva as of the date of the
Agreement and any Replacement Operator as of the date of replacement (and at
all

   
   

 

 

 

  

 

-2-

any and all agreements and other instruments as may be reasonably required by
the Owners in order to perform the services of the Operator hereunder, (ii)
must be competent to perform all the services and other obligations of the
Operator as provided in this Agreement and in a manner consistent with
Industry Practice and applicable law; and (iii) must hold all necessary
permits, licenses and approvals to perform the work.

  

  

(d) The Replacement Operator shall promptly review the Budget and shall
provide any proposed revisions thereto for review in accordance with Section
3.5.

  

  

(e) The Operator (including a Replacement Operator) may retain or contract
with another person (such party the "OandM Service Provider") designated by it
to undertake the rights and obligations as the Operator, provided that (i) the
requirements of Section 4.3 as applicable are satisfied, (ii) the OandM Service
Provider meets the requirements set forth in (c) above with respect to the
services it is providing; (iii) the Operator shall be liable to the Owners for
all acts and omissions of the OandM Service Provider; and (iv) the Operator
shall provide written notice that it has designated an OandM Service Provider,
the OandM Service Provider's duties and qualifications, the names and contact
information for its responsible representatives, and such other information as
an Owner may reasonably request.

  

  

(f) An Operator that is being replaced from time to time pursuant to this
Section 3.9 shall promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws, and consistent with Industry Practice, (i) to consummate and make
effective the assumption of the duties of Operator by the Replacement
Operator, including undertaking the actions and obligations set forth in
Section 11.7 of this Agreement; (ii) to assign agreements associated with the
duties as the Operator hereunder to the extent permitted in any such
agreement; and (iii) to provide to the Replacement Operator any information or
other assistance that the Replacement Operator reasonably deems necessary to
satisfy all applicable regulatory requirements.

  

  

(g) Upon satisfaction of the terms of this Section 3.9, the Replacement
Operator shall be deemed to be the Operator for all purposes under this
Agreement and shall have the rights and obligations of the Operator hereunder.

hereto in their respective capacities as Owners.

Owners for costs incurred and services performed in accordance with this
Agreement prior to the assumption by the Replacement Operator of the duties of
the Operator."

Re:

Proposed Lease of PEPCO Property

   
---|--- 
 

 

  

  

Dear Sirs:

  

  

  

This letter (this "Letter Agreement") is intended to (a) replace that certain
Letter of Intent, dated as of March 16, 2007, by and between Potomac Electric
Power Company ("PEPCO") and Conectiv Energy Supply, Inc. or its designated
affiliate, which Letter of Intent has expired, and (b) to confirm the
agreement by and between PEPCO and [entity to be designated by Purchaser]
("Optionee") to grant to Optionee the exclusive right, for an agreed period,
to lease approximately 10+- acres of property owned by PEPCO located at
PEPCO's Talbert Substation #166, being located off the southerly side of Cross
Road, Brandywine District 11/1175900, Prince Georges County, Maryland, as more
particularly described on Exhibit A hereto (the "Property"). The lease would
be an integral component of the development by Optionee of an electric power
generation facility on the Property (the "Project"). Optionee will be
submitting this Letter Agreement to PJM Interconnection, LLC ("PJM"), along
with its request that PJM conduct an analysis of the feasibility of
interconnection of the Project to the regional electric transmission grid. In
this Letter Agreement, Optionee and PEPCO are sometimes referred to
individually as a "Party" and are sometimes referred to jointly as the
"Parties".

  

  

  

In furtherance of the above-stated intentions, the Parties hereby agree as
follows:

  

  

1. Exercise of Option: Optionee shall have the exclusive right to enter into a lease agreement with PEPCO in respect of the Property (the "Option"). Optionee may elect to exercise the Option by providing PEPCO written notice at any time (a) from the date hereof through and including December 31, 2012 (the "Initial Option Term") and (b) thereafter, until the expiration of the Extended Option Term (as hereinafter defined). Upon the expiration of the Initial Option Term, the term of this Letter Agreement shall be automatically extended for two additional six (6) month periods, unless the Optionee provides written notice of its desire to

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

terminate this Letter Agreement (the "Extended Option Term"). If the Option
has been exercised prior to the expiration of the Extended Option Term, the
Parties agree to execute and deliver a lease agreement, substantially in the
form of the lease attached as Exhibit B hereto (the "Definitive Agreement")1,
as promptly as possible, which Definitive Agreement shall include, but shall
not be limited to the following terms and conditions:

  

  

 

a. The annual lease payment for the Property shall be based on the fair market
rental value of the Property and shall be determined by an independent rental
appraisal by a local MAI appraiser, which appraiser will be chosen by mutual
agreement between the Parties.

  

 

  

b. Optionee shall use the Property solely for the Project and reasonably
related activities.

  

  

c. PEPCO shall reserve unto itself, its affiliates, successors and assigns the
right to own, operate, maintain, repair, upgrade, install, alter, remove,
inspect, construct, modify, restore, rebuild, replace and expand any present
or future substation, transmission, distribution and communication equipment
and lines, and communication towers located now or in the future in, under,
through, upon, over and across the Property, including the right of access
thereto, for the purposes of conducting the business of providing transmission
and distribution service. PEPCO shall utilize its future reserved rights only
in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with Optionee's business or
Optionee's use of the Property.

  

  

The leasehold interest in the Property will be conveyed free and clear of all
liens, encumbrances and easements, EXCEPTING HOWEVER, existing and future
building restrictions, ordinances, easements of roads, easements visible upon
the ground, privileges or rights of public service companies, if any, other
than any such restrictions, easements, privileges or rights hereinafter
created by PEPCO, otherwise the title to the leasehold interest in the
Property shall be good and marketable and will be insured at regular rates by
a reputable title insurance company. PEPCO shall, at its cost, promptly obtain
and provide reasonable evidence to Optionee of the complete release of any
liens or encumbrances against the Property in favor of PEPCO's bondholders
before or contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of the Definitive
Agreement. Such obligation to execute and deliver the Definitive Agreement
shall continue to the date which is the later of (i) sixty (60) days after the
date on which the Option has been exercised, (ii) the end of the Initial
Option Term and (iii)the end of the Extended Option Term, if any (the period
from the date hereof to such later date being herein called the "Term").

  

  

2. Term: If Optionee has failed to exercise the Option on or before the last day of the Extended Option Term or if the Parties fail to execute and deliver the Definitive Agreement by the end of the Term, this Letter Agreement shall terminate.

  
   

  

1 NOTE: THE FORM OF LEASE WILL BE BASED ON THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CUMBERLAND
LEASE, AS MODIFIED AS APPROPRIATE TO INCLUDE LEASE PAYMENTS AT MARKET RATES
AND TERMS AND TO DELETE THE PURCHASE OPTION.

 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-2-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

3. Exclusivity: During the Term, PEPCO shall not offer to lease or sell the Property to any other party or entertain any offer to lease or purchase the Property from any other party.

  

  

4. Subdivision: If Optionee exercises the Option and any portion of the Property to be leased is not a legally subdivided parcel, then either Party may, at its option, prepare a subdivision plan with respect thereto and shall apply for and obtain all necessary approvals of the final subdivision plan from the municipality in which the Property is located. PEPCO or Optionee, as the case may be, shall cooperate with the other Party, in either case at Optionee's sole cost and expense, in connection with preparing the subdivision plan and obtaining municipal approval thereof (including, without limitation, execution of the plat). After the subdivision plan has been finally approved by applicable municipal authorities, the Party that receives such approval shall cause the subdivision plan to be recorded so that the Property can be leased by PEPCO to Optionee as a legally subdivided lot or lots.

  

  

5. Optionee's Right to Access the Property and Indemnification: During the Term, PEPCO grants to Optionee, upon reasonable notice to PEPCO, full and free access to the Property at all reasonable times during normal business hours to conduct whatever analysis and studies Optionee deems necessary for determining the suitability of the Property for construction and operation of the Project. For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Letter Agreement shall be construed as imposing any obligation upon Optionee to make any investigation or perform any due diligence regarding the Property. Optionee agrees to indemnify and hold PEPCO harmless from and against any and all liability, claims, damages, costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees and the cost of litigation) arising from or related to the conduct of any analysis, studies or investigations by Optionee, its employees, consultants or contractors on or about the Property; provided, however, that in no event shall Optionee be liable for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of the existing condition (whether discovered or undiscovered) of the Property, Optionee's discovery or investigation of any environmental condition on the Property or the negligence or willful misconduct of PEPCO, its employees, consultants or contractors.

  

  

6. Maintenance and Risk of Loss: From the date of the acceptance of this Letter Agreement until the earlier of (i) the end of the Term or (ii) the execution and delivery of the Definitive Agreement:

  

  

    

  |  |  

(a)

  |  

PEPCO shall maintain the Property in good condition and repair and in
accordance with prudent utility practices; and

   
---|---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(b) PEPCO shall bear risk of loss from fire or other casualties.

  

  

7. Costs and Expenses: Except as may be explicitly set forth herein, in the Definitive Agreement or otherwise agreed, Optionee and PEPCO shall each be responsible for their own costs and expenses incurred at any time in connection with this Letter Agreement, the execution and delivery of the Definitive Agreement and any due diligence performed by Optionee.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-3-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

8. Revocation of Option: Following Optionee's delivery of notice of exercise of the Option pursuant to paragraph 1, above, but before execution and delivery of the Definitive Agreement, Optionee reserves the right to revoke its notice to exercise the Option (with or without cause) by written notice to PEPCO for up to 90 days following the date of such exercise; provided, however, that in the event of any such revocation, Optionee shall reimburse PEPCO for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by PEPCO in connection with the exercise of the Option by Optionee, the preparation and negotiation of the Definitive Agreement and obtaining any approvals required in connection therewith. Immediately following any revocation under this paragraph 8, this Letter Agreement shall automatically terminate.

  

  

9. Assignment: This Letter Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties and their respective heirs, successors, and assigns. For avoidance of doubt, Optionee may assign its interests in this Letter Agreement to any affiliate succeeding substantially as a whole to Optionee's interests in the Project without PEPCO's consent but upon not less than five days advance written notice. Moreover, Optionee may freely assign and/or otherwise encumber all or any portion of Optionee's right title and interest in this Letter Agreement to a lender or lenders (or trustee or agent thereof) as collateral security.

  

  

Any conveyance of and any encumbrance of or security interest in all or part
of PEPCO's interest in the Property arising after the date of this Letter
Agreement shall be subject and subordinate to and shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of this Letter Agreement and to Optionee's rights
hereunder.

  

  

10. Recording: The Parties agree to execute and record this Letter Agreement or instead, at the request of either Party, a short-form memorandum thereof substantially identical to Exhibit C hereof, in the office of the Recorder of Deeds for [____]. Each of PEPCO and Optionee shall pay one-half of the recording costs.

  

  

11. Additional Documents: Except to the extent inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, each Party, at its sole cost and expense, shall promptly execute such additional documents and instruments and take such actions as are necessary or desirable or as shall be reasonably requested by the other Party to effect the matters contemplated by this Letter Agreement.

  

  

12. Termination; Survival: Either Party shall be entitled to terminate this Letter Agreement prior to the expiration of the Term, and to seek any damages that may be available at law or in equity, if the other Party is in material breach of its obligations, covenants, representations or warranties under this Letter Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty days after written notice thereof by such non-breaching Party. Paragraphs 5, 8 and 12 shall survive any expiration or termination of this Letter Agreement.

  

  

13. Acceptance: Written acceptance by PEPCO of this Letter Agreement must be obtained on or before [____], 2010.

Section 5.1 Charges for Services. Charges for Services shall be based upon the
fully-loaded cost of providing each Service (each charge, a "Service Charge"),
including direct costs and indirect costs (such as overhead and the Service
Provider's internal billing rates) but excluding meals, except to the extent
agreed in writing by the Service Recipient, but without any element of profit.
The Service Charge shall be exclusive of any value added taxes, sales taxes or
similar taxes, charges, duties, fees, levies or other assessments
(collectively, "Sales Tax") required by Law to be chargeable in respect of the
transactions hereunder, and an amount equal to such legally required charges,
costs and Sales Tax shall be paid by Purchaser to the Service Provider in
addition to the Service Charge.

  

  

Section 5.2 Payment Terms. Not later than thirty (30) days after each calendar
month, the Service Provider shall deliver to Purchaser a written statement of
amounts reflecting the Service Charge and legally required Sales Tax for any
Services provided during such month by the Service Provider pursuant to this
Agreement. Each such invoice shall be accompanied by reasonable documentation
or other reasonable calculation supporting such Service Charges. Purchaser
shall pay such invoices within thirty (30) days after the date upon which each
such

  

   
   

 

 

 

  

 

-4-  

  

 

 

 

   
   

invoice hereunder is received by Purchaser. If Purchaser fails to pay any such
invoice within such 30-day period, then Purchaser shall pay interest on such
invoiced amount from and after the thirty-first day after the date Purchaser
received such invoice at a rate equal to 30-day LIBOR plus 1%.

  

  

Section 5.3 Audit Right. The Service Provider shall maintain complete and
accurate books and records relating to Service Charges to the Service
Recipients under this Agreement. Purchaser shall be entitled from time to time
upon reasonable request and at its own cost to audit the books and records of
the Service Provider related to the Services, using its own personnel or
personnel from its independent auditing firm. Discrepancies identified as a
result of any audit shall be promptly reconciled between the Parties in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

ARTICLE 6

  

  

  

  

General Obligations; Standard of Care

  

  

Section 6.1 Service Provider. The Service Provider shall provide, and cause
its Affiliates, employees and agents to provide, the Services with the same
degree of care utilized by the Service Provider in rendering such services for
the operations of the Companies immediately prior to the Closing Date. Under
no circumstances shall the Service Provider, its Affiliates or any of their
respective employees or agents be held accountable to a greater standard of
care or skill.

  

  

Section 6.2 Service Recipient. A Service Recipient shall, in connection with
receiving Services, (i) follow the policies, procedures and practices in
effect at the Companies in the period immediately before the Closing Date,
(ii) provide information and documentation sufficient for the Service Provider
to perform the Services as they were performed immediately before the Closing
Date and (iii) make available, as reasonably requested by the Service
Provider, sufficient resources. A Service Recipient shall, further, make
timely decisions and provide approvals and acceptances in order that the
Service Provider is not impeded in the timely performance of its obligations
hereunder. A Service Recipient shall grant the Service Provider, its
Affiliates and their respective employees and agents access to sites, systems,
personnel and information (subject to the provisions of confidentiality in the
Confidentiality Agreement and in the Purchase Agreement) during regular
business hours or as otherwise reasonably requested to facilitate the Service
Provider's performance of its obligations hereunder. A Service Recipient shall
inform the Service Provider's personnel of, and the Service Provider shall
cause its personnel to obey, any and all security regulations and other
published policies of the Service Recipient.

  

  

Section 6.3 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
HEREIN, THE PARTIES MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES OR OTHER
DELIVERABLES PROVIDED BY IT HEREUNDER.

Section 6.4 Transitional Nature of Services; Changes. The Parties acknowledge
the transitional nature of the Services and that the Services are being
furnished by the Service Provider solely for the purpose of accommodating
Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement. The Parties agree that the Service Provider may make changes from
time to time in the manner of performing the Services if it is making similar
changes in performing similar services for itself and its Affiliates and if
the Service Provider furnishes to the Service Recipient not less than fifteen
(15) days prior written notice regarding such changes. Purchaser acknowledges
its responsibility, at the end of the Transition Period, to determine which
Services it wishes to maintain and to perform such Services, without the
involvement of the Service Provider, its Affiliates or any of their respective
employees or agents.

  

  

Section 6.5 Responsibility for Errors; Delays. The Service Provider's sole
responsibility to a Service Recipient:

  

  

(a) for errors or omissions in Services shall be to furnish correct
information, payment and/or adjustment in the Services, at no additional cost
or expense to the Service Recipient; provided, the Service Recipient must
promptly advise the Service Provider of any such error or omission of which it
becomes aware after having used reasonable efforts to detect any such errors
or omissions in accordance with the standard of care set forth in Section 6.2;
and

  

  

(b) for failure to deliver any Service for the reasons stated in Section 3.3,
shall be to use reasonable efforts, subject to Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, to
make such Service available and/or to resume performing such Service to the
extent, and as soon as, reasonably practicable.

  

  

Section 6.6 Good Faith Cooperation; Consents. The Parties will use good faith
efforts to cooperate with each other in all matters relating to the provision
and receipt of Services. Such cooperation shall include exchanging
information, performing adjustments, and obtaining all third party consents,
licenses, sublicenses or approvals necessary to permit each Party to perform
its obligations hereunder (including by way of example, not by way of
limitation, rights to use third party software needed for the performance of
Services). The costs of obtaining such third party consents, licenses,
sublicenses or approvals shall be borne by the Service Recipient; provided,
that, the Service Provider shall not incur any such costs without the prior
written consent of Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no
circumstances shall the Service Provider be obligated to provide a Service if
(A) the Service Provider is unable to obtain necessary consents, licenses,
sublicenses or approvals relating to such Service on commercially reasonable
terms, despite its commercially reasonable efforts to do so, which efforts
shall be at the Service Recipient's sole cost and expense, and is unable to
make alternative arrangements to continue providing the applicable Service
that are commercially reasonable, or (B) in order to provide such Service, the
Service Provider will have an obligation to make any payments to any third
party or incur any obligations, or seek broader rights or more favorable
terms, in respect of any such consents, licenses, sublicenses or approvals,
provided it has notified Purchaser of such payments or other obligations and
Purchaser elects not to assume them. Each Party will maintain, in accordance
with its standard document retention procedures, documentation supporting the
information relevant to cost calculations and cooperate with the other Party
in making such information available as needed in the event of a tax audit.

Early Termination

  

  

Section 7.1 Early Termination. Purchaser may terminate this Agreement, either
with respect to all or with respect to any one or more of the Services
provided hereunder at any time and from time to time, for any reason or for no
reason, upon fifteen (15) days prior written notice to the Service Provider.
If Purchaser terminates this Agreement with respect to less than all of the
Services, this Agreement will continue with respect to the remaining Services
in accordance with its terms. The Service Provider may terminate this
Agreement if the Service Recipient fails to pay any amount which is due and
payable in respect of any Service in accordance with the provisions of Section
5.2 hereof, and the Service Recipient does not cure such breach within thirty
(30) days after being given written notice of such breach. If the Service
Recipient in good faith disputes any part or all of an invoice, the Service
Recipient (a) shall pay any undisputed portion of the invoice when due and (b)
shall provide to Service Provider, on or before the date that the invoice was
due, a written explanation in reasonable detail setting forth the basis for
the dispute. The Parties shall thereafter negotiate in good faith to resolve
the dispute, and Service Provider shall continue to perform the Services
pending a resolution of the dispute for a period not to exceed thirty days
from the end of the applicable cure period. In addition, either Party may
terminate this Agreement with respect to a specific Service if the other Party
materially breaches a material provision with regard to that particular
Service (other than for nonpayment) and does not cure such breach (or does not
take reasonable steps required under the circumstances to cure such breach
going forward) within thirty (30) days after being given notice of the breach.
This Agreement may be terminated upon the mutual written agreement of
Purchaser and the Service Provider at any time.

  

  

Section 7.2 Rights and Duties of Parties Upon Termination. Upon the expiration
of the Transition Period or the termination of this Agreement or any Service
for any reason in accordance with the terms hereof, the Parties shall
cooperate in the orderly termination of the Services hereunder. From and after
the date of termination of any Service for any reason, the Service Provider's
obligation to provide such Service(s) to the Service Recipient shall cease and
Purchaser shall have no obligation to pay the Service Charge for such
Service(s) (other than those performed prior to termination).

  

  

Section 7.3 Survival. In the event of any termination with respect to one or
more, but less than all Services, this Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect with respect to any Services that have not been terminated.
Articles 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 shall in any event survive any
termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

Force Majeure

  

  

Each Party will be excused for any failure or delay in performing any of its
obligations under this Agreement, other than the obligations of the Service
Recipient to make payments to the performing Party pursuant to Article 5
hereof for Services rendered, if such failure or delay is caused solely by
Force Majeure. "Force Majeure" includes, without limitation, any act of God or
the public enemy; any accident, explosion, fire, ice, earthquake, lightning,

governmental authority or lawfully established civilian authorities, or any
other circumstance or event beyond the reasonable control of the Party relying
upon such circumstance or event. Performance shall be excused only to the
extent of and during the reasonable continuance of a Force Majeure. Any
deadline or time for performance which falls due during or subsequent to the
occurrence of a Force Majeure shall be automatically extended for a period of
time equal to the period of such Force Majeure. The Service Provider shall
promptly notify Purchaser if, by reason of Force Majeure, the Service Provider
is unable to meet any deadline or time for performance. In the event that any
part of the Services required under this Agreement is rendered invalid as a
result of such Force Majeure, the Service Provider shall, upon written request
from Purchaser, and at Purchaser's expense, repeat that part of the Services
affected by the Force Majeure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Party
claiming Force Majeure shall use reasonable efforts to avoid or mitigate the
delay or other impact caused by any event that has resulted in a Force Majeure
and shall proceed diligently to perform the Services which are not affected by
such event and shall resume the affected Services as soon as the effects of
such event have ceased or been mitigated.

Agreement

  

  

Agreement, dated as of [______], 2010 (this "Agreement"), by and between
Atlantic City Electric Company, a New Jersey corporation ("ACE"), and Conectiv
Atlantic Generation, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company ("CAG").

  

  

Whereas, pursuant to that certain Asset Transfer Agreement, dated as of
February 29, 2004 (the "Asset Transfer Agreement"), by and between ACE and
CAG, ACE transferred to CAG certain properties and assets relating to the
generation of electricity, including the Deepwater generating station (the
"Covered Generating Station");

  

  

Whereas, Schedule 6.7 to the Asset Transfer Agreement lists a series of
outstanding tax-exempt revenue bonds issued by The Pollution Control Financing
Authority of Salem County (together with any successor body, board, authority,
agency or other political subdivision or instrumentality of the State of New
Jersey or Salem County, the "Salem Authority"), the proceeds of which were
used by the Salem Authority to refinance a prior issuance of tax exempt bonds
issued by the Salem Authority, the proceeds of which were loaned to ACE by the
Salem Authority to finance the construction of certain pollution control
facilities at the Covered Generating Station;

  

  

Whereas, Section 6.7 of the Asset Transfer Agreement sets forth certain
acknowledgements, covenants and agreements of CAG relating to the pollution
control facilities and the continuing tax-exempt status of the listed series
of tax-exempt revenue bonds; and

  

  

Whereas, ACE and CAG wish to enter into certain further acknowledgements,
covenants and agreements concerning the pollution control facilities as
related to the continuing tax-exempt status of the listed series of tax-exempt
revenue bonds.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements
herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

Section 1.01 Certain Acknowledgements and Agreements.

  

  

(a) CAG acknowledges (i) that the assets (the "Covered Assets") listed on
Schedule A attached hereto (the "Exempt Facilities") are being financed with
the proceeds of the pollution control revenue bonds listed in the adjacent
column on Schedule A (together with any tax-exempt revenue bonds issued in the
future to refinance the bonds listed on Schedule A, the "Tax-Exempt Bonds")
and (ii) that CAG has been informed by ACE that the continuing tax-exempt
status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds depends on the continuing qualifying use of the
Exempt Facilities ("Qualifying Use") in accordance with Section 103(b)(4)(F)
of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and the regulations
promulgated thereunder.

  

  

(b) CAG hereby notifies ACE, and ACE hereby acknowledges, that (i) as soon as
practicable following the date of the closing of the sale and purchase by New
Development Holdings, LLC (a Delaware limited liability company) of the
membership interests of Conectiv Energy Holdings, LLC (a Delaware limited
liability company) from Conectiv, LLC (a Delaware limited liability company)
(the "PSA Closing Date"), CAG

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  


   

intends to convert the Covered Generating Station from its current coal fired
generation to natural gas fired generation which will result in the temporary
or permanent suspension of the use of certain of the Exempt Facilities, and
(ii) after the PSA Closing Date, CAG may refrain from conducting any
maintenance activities with respect to such Exempt Facilities.

  

 

  

(c) Except insofar as notice has been given under Section 1.01(b), CAG agrees
to use reasonable best efforts to notify ACE of (i) any material change or
modification to the Exempt Facilities, (ii) any material suspension or any
termination of the operation of the Exempt Facilities or (iii) any removal or
disassembly of the Exempt Facilities, or in each case, any significant
component thereof, with such notice to be given at least 90 days prior to such
change in use.

  


 

  

(d) CAG agrees to use reasonable best efforts to provide ACE with written
notice of any sale or other disposition of the Covered Generating Station or
of the Exempt Facilities at least 30 days prior to such sale or disposition or
as soon as is reasonably practicable given the timing and confidential nature
of such sale or disposition. CAG shall require, as a condition to the
effectiveness of such sale or disposition, that the subsequent owner of the
Covered Generating Station or of the Exempt Facilities covenant and agree to
comply with the provisions of this Section 1.01.

  

  

(e) Upon 30 days written notice from ACE, CAG shall provide ACE with an annual
certification of the current status of the Exempt Facilities.

  

  

(f) If ACE shall desire to refund, refinance, remarket, amend or otherwise
modify the terms of any Tax-Exempt Bonds, CAG shall cooperate with ACE and
with bond counsel, at ACE's sole cost and expense, with respect to such bond
refunding, refinancing, remarketing, amendment or modification and shall
provide upon request any representations that are reasonably requested and
that CAG can reasonably provide concerning its use of the Exempt Facilities
for a Qualifying Use and its compliance to such date; provided, however, that
CAG shall not be required to assume any additional obligations with respect to
the Exempt Facilities in connection therewith.

  

  

(g) The covenants and agreements of CAG contained in this Section 1.01 shall
continue in effect so long as (i) any of the Tax-Exempt Bonds listed on
Schedule A shall remain outstanding and (ii) any Tax Exempt Bonds issued to
refinance or refund any Tax Exempt Bonds listed on Schedule A shall remain
outstanding, provided that ACE has notified CAG of the issuance of such bonds
prior to such refunding or reissuance. ACE shall notify CAG promptly when
there shall be no Tax-Exempt Bonds outstanding with respect to any of the
Exempt Facilities. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.01(g), the
covenants and agreements of CAG contained in this Section 1.01 shall cease
with respect to any of the Exempt Facilities or any part thereof upon the
closing of a sale or other disposition of such Exempt Facilities following
notification by CDG in accordance with Section 1.01(d); provided, that the
subsequent owner of such Exempt Facilities has covenanted and agreed to comply
with the provisions of this Section 1.01.

  

   
   

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

   
   

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, CAG shall not be
liable for any action taken or any failure to act, unless such action or
inaction constitutes fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct.

  

  

Section 1.02 Further Assurance. Except to the extent inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement, each party hereto covenants and agrees to execute and
deliver such further and other releases, instruments, agreements and writings
and do and perform, and cause to be done and performed, such further and other
acts and things that may be necessary or desirable in order to give full
effect to this Agreement.

Agreement

  


 

  

Agreement, dated as of [______], 2010 (this "Agreement"), by and between
Delmarva Power and Light Company, a Delaware and Virginia corporation ("DPL"),
and Conectiv Delmarva Generation, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company
("CDG").

  


 

  

Whereas, pursuant to that certain Asset Transfer Agreement, dated as of July
1, 2000 (the "Asset Transfer Agreement"), by and between DPL and CDG, DPL
transferred to CDG certain properties and assets relating to the generation of
electricity, including the Edgemoor generating station and the Hay Road
generation station (the "Covered Generating Stations");

  


 

  

Whereas, Schedule 6.9 to the Asset Transfer Agreement lists five series of
then-outstanding tax-exempt revenue bonds issued by The Delaware Economic
Development Authority (together with any successor body, board, authority,
agency or other political subdivision or instrumentality of the State of
Delaware, "DEDA"), the proceeds of which (i) were loaned by DEDA to DPL to
finance the construction of certain pollution control facilities at the
Covered Generating Stations or (ii) were used by DEDA to refinance a prior
issuance of tax exempt bonds issued by DEDA, the proceeds of which were loaned
to DPL by DEDA to finance the construction of certain pollution control
facilities at the Covered Generating Stations;

  


 

  

Whereas, Section 6.9 of the Asset Transfer Agreement sets forth certain
acknowledgements, covenants and agreements of CDG relating to the pollution
control facilities and the continuing tax-exempt status of the listed tax-
exempt revenue bonds;

  


 

  

Whereas, since the execution and delivery of the Asset Transfer Agreement,
DEDA has refinance several of the series of the tax-exempt revenue bonds
listed on Schedule 6.9 of the Asset Transfer Agreement through the issuance of
new tax-exempt bonds; and

  


 

  

Whereas, DPL and CDG wish to enter into certain further acknowledgements,
covenants and agreements concerning the pollution control facilities as
related to the continuing tax-exempt status of the corresponding tax-exempt
revenue bonds issued by DEDA.

  


 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements
herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  


 

  

Section 1.01 Certain Acknowledgements and Agreements.

  


 

  

(a) CDG acknowledges (i) that the assets (the "Covered Assets") listed on
Schedule A attached hereto (the "Exempt Facilities") are being financed with
the proceeds of the pollution control revenue bonds listed in the adjacent
column on Schedule A (together with any tax-exempt revenue bonds issued in the
future to refinance the bonds listed on Schedule A, the "Tax-Exempt Bonds")
and (ii) that CDG has been informed by DPL that the continuing tax-exempt
status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds depends on the continuing qualifying use of the
Exempt Facilities ("Qualifying Use") in

   
   

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

   
   

accordance with Section 103(b)(4)(F) of the United States Internal Revenue
Code of 1954 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

  


 

  

(b) CDG hereby notifies DPL, and DPL hereby acknowledges, that (i) as soon as
practicable following the date of the closing of the sale and purchase by New
Development Holdings, LLC (a Delaware limited liability company) of the
membership interests of Conectiv Energy Holdings, LLC (a Delaware limited
liability company) from Conectiv, LLC (a Delaware limited liability company)
(the "PSA Closing Date"), CDG intends to convert the Edgemoor generating
station from its current coal fired generation to natural gas fired generation
which will result in the temporary or permanent suspension of the use of
certain of the Exempt Facilities, and (ii) after the PSA Closing Date, CDG may
refrain from conducting any maintenance activities with respect to such Exempt
Facilities.

  


 

  

(c) Except insofar as notice has been given under Section 1.01(b), CDG agrees
to use reasonable best efforts to notify DPL of (i) any material change or
modification to the Exempt Facilities, (ii) any material suspension or any
termination of the operation of the Exempt Facilities or (iii) any removal or
disassembly of the Exempt Facilities, or in each case, any significant
component thereof, with such notice to be given at least 90 days prior to such
change in use.

  


 

  

(d) CDG agrees to use reasonable best efforts to provide DPL with written
notice of any sale or other disposition of either Covered Generating Station
or of the Exempt Facilities at least 30 days prior to such sale or disposition
or as soon as is reasonably practicable given the timing and confidential
nature of any such sale or disposition. CDG shall require, as a condition to
the effectiveness of such sale or disposition, that the subsequent owner of
either Covered Generating Station or of the Exempt Facilities covenant and
agree to comply with the provisions of this Section 1.01.

  

  

(e) If DPL shall desire to refund, refinance, remarket, amend or otherwise
modify the terms of any Tax-Exempt Bonds, CDG shall cooperate with DPL and
with bond counsel, at DPL's sole cost and expense, with respect to such bond
refunding, refinancing, remarketing, amendment or modification and shall
provide upon request any representations that are reasonably requested and
that CDG can reasonably provide concerning its use of the Exempt Facilities
for a Qualifying Use and its compliance to such date; provided, however, that
CDG shall not be required to assume any additional obligations with respect to
the Exempt Facilities in connection therewith.

  


 

  

(f) Upon 30 days written notice from DPL, CDG shall provide DPL with an annual
certification of the current status of the Exempt Facilities.

  


 

  

(g) CDG agrees that DEDA and the trustee for any holders of Tax-Exempt Bonds
and their duly authorized representatives shall have the right at all
reasonable times (but not more than once per year) to enter upon and examine
and inspect the Exempt Facilities, provided that such inspection (i) shall be
at the sole cost, risk and expense of DPL and (ii) shall be subject to such
restrictions on scope and schedule so as

   
   

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

   
   

not to unreasonably interfere with the normal conduct of the business of CDG
or with the operation of the Covered Generating Stations.

  


 

  

(h) CDG agrees to pay and discharge promptly all taxes, assessments and other
charges imposed upon it with respect to the Exempt Facilities property before
the same shall become in default, as well as all lawful claims which, if
unpaid, might become a lien or charge on the Exempt Facilities property or any
part thereof. CDG may, at its own expense and in its own name in good faith
contest or appeal any such taxes, assessments or other charges, but shall not
permit any such taxes, assessments or charges to remain unpaid if such
nonpayment shall subject the Exempt Facilities or any part thereof to loss or
forfeiture.

  


 

  

(i) The covenants and agreements of CDG contained in this Section 1.01 shall
continue in effect so long as (i) any of the Tax-Exempt Bonds listed on
Schedule A shall remain outstanding and (ii) any Tax Exempt Bonds issued to
refinance or refund any Tax Exempt Bonds listed on Schedule A shall remain
outstanding, provided that DPL has notified CDG of the issuance of such bonds
prior to such refunding or reissuance. DPL shall notify CDG promptly when
there shall be no Tax-Exempt Bonds outstanding with respect to any of the
Exempt Facilities. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.01(i), the
covenants and agreements of CDG contained in this Section 1.01 shall cease
with respect to any of the Exempt Facilities or any part thereof, upon the
closing of a sale or other disposition of such Exempt Facilities following
notification by CDG in accordance with Section 1.01(d); provided that the
subsequent owner of such Exempt Facilities has covenanted and agreed to comply
with the provisions of this Section 1.01.

  


 

  

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, CDG shall not be
liable for any action taken or any failure to act, unless such action or
inaction constitutes fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct.

  


 

  

Section 1.02 Further Assurance. Except to the extent inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement, each party hereto covenants and agrees to execute and
deliver such further and other releases, instruments, agreements and writings
