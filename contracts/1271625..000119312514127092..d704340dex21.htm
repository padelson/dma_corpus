SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall

The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is

become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), subdivision,
combination, exchange, stock dividend, stock distribution, or any other
similar event, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such event so as to provide Parent and the holders of Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ that nothing in this paragraph (d) shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 2.2 _Treatment of Options, Restricted Stock Units_.

 

(a) _Stock Options_. Except as provided below, at the Effective Time, each
option (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") to purchase Shares granted under
the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the "
_Company Stock Plans_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become fully vested. In addition, each Company Stock
Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former
holder of any such cancelled Company Stock Option as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time an amount in cash (without interest,
and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the
product of (i) the excess (if any) of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Share under such Company Stock Option and (ii) the number
of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option; _provided_ that if the
exercise price per Share of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be
cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.

(b) _Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each restricted stock
unit (" _RSU_ ") granted under the Company Stock Plans shall become fully
earned and vested with respect to 100% of the Shares set forth in the terms of
the agreement granting such RSU and shall be cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former holder of any
such cancelled RSU as soon as practicable following the Effective Time an
amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax) equal to the Merger Consideration for each such fully earned
and vested RSU.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver all required
notices (which notices shall have been approved by Parent, in its reasonable
discretion) to each holder of Company Stock Options and RSUs setting forth
each holders rights pursuant to the respective Company Stock Plan, stating
that such Company Stock Options and RSUs shall be treated in the manner set
forth in this Section 2.2.

 

(d) The Company shall take all actions necessary, as of the Effective Time,
(i) to ensure that the Company Stock Plans and any agreements thereunder,
together with any other

 



4  equity-based compensation plan maintained by the Company (collectively, the
" _Company Equity Plans_ "), shall terminate, and (ii) to ensure that no
holder of a Company Stock Option or RSU or any participant in any Company
Equity Plan or any other employee incentive or benefit plan, program or
arrangement or any non-employee director plan maintained by the Company shall
have any rights to acquire, or other rights in respect of, the capital stock
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, except
the right to receive the payment contemplated by this Section 2.2 in
cancellation and settlement thereof.

 

SECTION 2.3 _Exchange and Payment_.

 

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit
of holders of Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article II (such cash, the " _Payment
Fund_ "). Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Payment Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to
this Article II.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
third Business Day following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
(the " _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares that were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and contain such
other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.3(j) or, in the
case of uncertificated Shares represented by book entry (the " _Book-Entry
Shares_ "), upon adherence to the procedures as set forth in the letter of
transmittal) to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate (subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Promptly after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the third Business Day
thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to issue
and deliver to each holder of Book-Entry Shares a check or wire transfer for
the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Article II in respect of such Book-Entry Shares, without such holder being
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration.

 

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time and, in any event, not later than the
third Business Day following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation
shall send, or shall instruct the Paying Agent to send, to each record holder
of a Company Stock Option or RSU in respect of which a cash payment is payable
at the Effective Time under Section 2.2 a notice summarizing such holders
rights under this Agreement with respect to such award and setting forth any
procedures that such holder must follow to receive payment.

 



5 (d) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax is
not applicable.

(e) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Article II, without any interest thereon.

(f) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.

(g) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest or other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon demand.

(h) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any remaining holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation as general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger
Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Law).

 

(i) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment
Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall not have been exchanged prior to the date on which the related
Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
federal, state, local or foreign government or subdivision thereof or any
other governmental, administrative, judicial, arbitral, legislative,
executive, regulatory or self-regulatory authority, instrumentality, agency,
commission or body (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ "), any such Merger
Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



6 (j) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent
may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will as promptly as practicable deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(k) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have
been perfected as described in Section 2.5 shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand.

SECTION 2.4  _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
payable to any holder of Shares, Company Stock Options, RSUs or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

SECTION 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless
and until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost, such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL.
Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.
If any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to
appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into
and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably
lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.1(a). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such notices or
demands and any other instruments received by the Company relating to rights
to appraisal, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, settle or offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands.

subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure of
such information with respect to any other section or subsection of this
Article III to which the relevance of such information is readily apparent on
its face) or (b) as disclosed or reflected in the Company SEC Documents
filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (but

such qualification or licensing necessary, except in the case of clause (iii),
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Company has previously delivered to Parent true and complete copies of
the Company Charter and Company Bylaws and the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of each of its

and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, options, rights of first

(including any limitation on voting, sale, transfer or other disposition or

other than Liens pursuant to or contemplated by the Existing Credit Agreement
and the Finnish Credit Facility (together, the " _Financing Liens_ "). Except
for the Convertible Notes and the Convertible Note Derivative Instruments,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding any bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations having the right to vote (or
convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, securities having the

Company has knowledge with respect to the holding, voting, registration,
redemption, repurchase or disposition of, or that restricts the transfer of,
any capital stock or other voting securities or equity interests of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



9 (b) Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all holders, as of the close of business on the Measurement
Date, of outstanding Company Stock Options, RSUs, and other similar rights to
purchase or receive Shares granted under the Company Equity Plans or otherwise
(collectively, " _Company Stock Awards_ "), indicating as applicable, with
respect to each Company Stock Award then outstanding, the type of award
granted, the number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Award, the name of
the plan under which such Company Stock Award was granted, the date of grant,
exercise or purchase price and expiration date thereof. Each Company Stock
Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of
the Code so qualifies and the exercise price of each other Company Stock
Option is and always has been no less than the fair market value of a Share as
determined on the date of grant of such Company Stock Option. The Company has
made available to Parent true and complete copies of all Company Equity Plans
(including the Company Stock Plans) and the forms of all stock option
agreements evidencing outstanding Company Stock Options and the forms of all
award agreements evidencing outstanding RSUs and other Company Stock Awards.
All Convertible Notes can be purchased or converted and settled in accordance
with Section 10.06 of each of the 2017 Notes Indenture, the 2027 Notes
Indenture and the 2028 Notes Indenture, each as further detailed in Section
5.13 hereof, upon the consummation of the Merger.

SECTION 3.3 _Subsidiaries_. Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a true and complete list of each Subsidiary of the Company, its
jurisdiction of incorporation or formation and the operating licenses and
Permits (other than immaterial local operating licenses and Permits) that it
holds. Except for the capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests
in, its Subsidiaries and Nextwave Card Corp., of which the Company owns 50% of
the outstanding equity interests, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any equity, membership interest, partnership interest, joint
venture interest, or other equity or voting interest in, or any interest
convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for any of the foregoing, nor is
it under any current or prospective obligation to form or participate in,
provide funds to, make any loan, capital contribution, guarantee, credit
enhancement or other investment in, or assume any liability or obligation of,
any third Person.

 

SECTION 3.4 _Authority_.

 

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, subject, in the case of the consummation of
the Merger, to the adoption and approval of this Agreement by the holders of
at least a majority of the outstanding Shares (the " _Company Stockholder
Approval_ "). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent
and

 



10  Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except to the
extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general principles of
equity).

 

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held at which all
directors of the Company were present duly and unanimously
adopted resolutions (i) determining that the terms of this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the
best interests of the Companys stockholders, (ii) approving and declaring
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, (iii) directing that this Agreement be submitted to the
stockholders of the Company for adoption and approval, and (iv) recommending
that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of the adoption and approval of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
which resolutions have not been subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn
in any way, except as may be permitted by Section 5.2.

(c) The Company Stockholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of any
class or series of the Companys capital stock or other securities required
in connection with the Merger. No vote of the holders of any class or series
of the Companys capital stock or other securities is required in connection
with the consummation of any of transactions contemplated hereby other than
the Merger.

SECTION 3.5 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and compliance by the Company with the provisions hereof
will not, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of, or result in, termination, cancellation, modification or
acceleration of any obligation under, or to the loss of a material benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties,
assets or rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, or give
rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or
entitlements under, or require any consent, waiver or approval of any Person
pursuant to, any provision of (i) the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, or
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational
documents) of any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) except as set forth in
Section 3.5(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, any bond,
debenture, note, mortgage, indenture, guarantee, license, lease, purchase or
sale order or other contract, commitment, agreement, instrument, obligation,
arrangement, understanding, undertaking, permit, concession or franchise,
whether oral or written (each, a " _Contract_ ") to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, or
(iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in
Section 3.5(b), any federal, state, local or foreign law (including common
law), statute, ordinance, rule, code, regulation, order, judgment, injunction,
decree or other legally enforceable requirement (" _Law_ ") or any rule or
regulation of The NASDAQ Stock Market (the " _NASDAQ_ ") applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound,
except as, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), as individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 



11 (b) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement require no consent, approval, authorization or
permit of, registration, declaration, or filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Entity, other than (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and appropriate documents
with the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company is
qualified to do business, (ii) compliance with any applicable requirements of
(A) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the " _HSR Act_
") and (B) any applicable Law analogous to the HSR Act or otherwise regulating
antitrust, competition or merger control matters and in each case existing in
foreign jurisdictions (" _Foreign Competition Laws_ "), (iii) compliance with
any applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "
_Securities Act_ "), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together
with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")
and any other applicable U.S. state or federal securities laws or the rules
of NASDAQ; (iv) the approval of Governmental Entities set forth in Section
3.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter relating to certain licenses held by
the Company or its Subsidiaries; and (v) such consents, approvals,
authorizations, permits, registrations, declarations, filings or notifications
the failure of which to make or obtain would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. As of the
date hereof, to the knowledge of the Company, there is no reason why any such
regulatory approvals or consents would not be received in order to permit
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
compliance with the provisions hereof on a timely basis.

SECTION 3.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_. 

(a) The Company has filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") on a timely basis all forms, reports, schedules,
statements and other documents required to be filed with or furnished to the
SEC by the Company since July 1, 2010 (all such documents, together with all
exhibits and schedules to the foregoing materials and all information
incorporated therein by reference, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior
to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), the Company
SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and all other applicable
federal securities Laws (including the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder), and, as of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date hereof, on the date of such filing), none of the
Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading ( _provided_ that the Company makes no
representation or warranty with respect to information furnished in writing
by Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or use in any such Company
SEC Documents).

(b) The financial statements (including the related notes and schedules
thereto) included (or incorporated by reference) in the Company SEC Documents
(i) have been prepared

 



12  in a manner consistent with the books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case
of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto), (iii) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the dates thereof and their respective consolidated results of operations and
cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments that were not,
or are not expected to be, material in amount), all in accordance with GAAP
and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Except as set
forth in Section 3.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, since the end of
the Companys most recently completed fiscal year, the Company has not made
any material change in the accounting practices or policies applied in the
preparation of its financial statements, except as required by GAAP, SEC rule
or policy or applicable Law.

(c) Since July 1, 2010, the Company has maintained disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) and
a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act), in each case sufficient to

approvals or consents would not be received in order to permit consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and compliance

Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they

stock of Merger Sub is owned directly or indirectly by Parent.

SECTION 4.7 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete
copies of (a) an executed commitment letter (as the same may be amended
pursuant to Section 5.9, the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to
which the lenders party thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, to provide or cause to be provided the debt amounts set
forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ " (which may include up to $750,000,000
in bridge financing (the " _Bridge Financing_ ") to be utilized in the event
the placement of bonds in a comparable amount (the " _Bond Financing_ ") is
not consummated)) and (b) an executed equity commitment letter (the " _Equity
Financing Commitment_ " and, together with the Debt Financing Commitments, the
" _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which Guarantor has committed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide equity financing in

together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). As of the date of this
Agreement, none of the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified,
and the respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not
been withdrawn or rescinded. As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing
Commitments are in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid and
binding obligation of each of Parent or Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of
Parent, the other parties thereto (except to

 



30  the extent limited by the applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or by general principles of equity). Parent or Merger Sub has fully
paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Debt
Financing Commitments or otherwise with respect to the Financing that are due
and payable on or prior to the date hereof. Except for the Financing
Commitments and the related fee letter (the " _Fee Letter_ ") complete copies
of which have been provided to the Company, with only fee amounts, securities
demand and market flex provisions and other customary threshold amounts
redacted) and the engagement letter with respect to the Debt Financing, as of
the date hereof there are no side letters or other agreements to which Parent
or Merger Sub is a party related to the Financing that could adversely affect
the availability of the Financing. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing other
than as set forth in or contemplated by the Financing Commitments and the Fee
Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the
Companys representations and warranties set forth in Article III and
compliance by the Company with its obligations under this Agreement, Parent
does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the funding
of the full amount of the Financing will not be satisfied or that the
Financing amounts will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing
Date. As of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of Parent, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under the
Financing Commitments. Assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations
and warranties set forth in Article III, the performance by the Company of
its obligations under this Agreement, and that the Financing is funded in
accordance with the Financing Commitments, the aggregate proceeds contemplated
by the Financing Commitments, together with other financial resources of
Parent and Merger Sub and the cash of the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, will be sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and
expenses.

 

SECTION 4.8 _Limited Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, the Guarantor has delivered to the Company the Limited Guarantee,

of which has been made available by Parent to the Company. The Limited
Guarantee is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Guarantor as of the date hereof, and no event has
occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under such Limited
Guarantee.

 

SECTION 4.9 _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time, assuming (a) the
satisfaction of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligation to
consummate the Merger, (b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in Article III (for such purposes, such
representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material
respects and all knowledge, materiality or "Material Adverse Effect"
qualifications and exceptions contained in such representations and warranties
shall be disregarded), and (c) that all estimates, projections and
forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries provided to Parent or Merger
Sub were prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue
to be reasonable, immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger, the Financing, the
payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of
existing indebtedness contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing

 



31  Commitments, and the payment of all related fees and expenses), the
Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately
following the transactions contemplated hereby. With respect to the Surviving
Corporation, " _Solvent_ " means that, as of any date of determination, (i)
the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, exceeds, as of such date,
the sum of (A) the value of all "liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including contingent and other
liabilities", as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance

of their "affiliates" or "associates" to be deemed an "interested
stockholder" as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

made available to Parent or Merger Sub or their

 



32  Representatives (except for the specific representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in this Agreement), and (ii) none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives shall have or be
subject to any liability to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person resulting
from the distribution to such Person, or such Persons use of or reliance on,

SECTION 5.2 _No Solicitation; Recommendation of the Merger_.

 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit or authorize any of its
Subsidiaries or any director, officer, employee, investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant, other advisor, agent or representative
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, endorse,
encourage or facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to, or
the making or completion of, any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information or data with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with,
any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and the
Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (A) immediately cease
and cause to be terminated all existing discussions and negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
potential Acquisition Proposal, (B) request the prompt return or destruction
of all confidential information previously furnished with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, and (C) not
terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
potential Acquisition Proposal, and shall enforce the provisions of any such
agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time following the date of
this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (1)
the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
believes in good faith to be bona fide, (2) such Acquisition Proposal was
unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.2,
(3) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
and (4) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel) that the failure to take the actions referred to in clause
(I) or (II) below would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law,
then the Company may (I) furnish

 



37  information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement containing terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to
the Company than, those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement (including
any standstill agreement contained therein); _provided_ that any non-public
information provided to any such Person shall have been previously provided
to Parent or shall be provided to Parent prior to or concurrently with the
time it is provided to such Person, and (II) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

 

(i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub) the adoption, approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, (B) adopt,
approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable the approval of
any Acquisition Proposal, or (C) resolve or agree to take any such actions
(each such action set forth in this paragraph (i), an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), or

 

(ii) (A) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract (each, an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which is intended to
or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or (B) resolve
or agree to take any such actions.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, if the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to
do so would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, taking into
account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by
Parent pursuant to this Section 5.2, (i) make an Adverse Recommendation Change
in response to either a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event or (ii)
solely in response to a Superior Proposal received after the date hereof that
was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section
5.2, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section
7.1(d)(iii) and concurrently enter into a binding Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
a Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement in response to a Superior
Proposal unless:

(i) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least four Business Days
before taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifies the
reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of
the Person making, such Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishes a
copy (if any) of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other
relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice by the Company and a new four
Business Day period); and

 



38 (ii) if Parent makes a written proposal during such four Business Day period
to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement (such written proposal
which shall be in a form that would create a binding contract if accepted by
the Company), the Company Board, after taking into consideration the adjusted
terms and conditions of this Agreement as proposed by Parent, continues to
determine in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor) that such Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement, as applicable, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law;

 

 _provided_ _further_ that the Company Board may not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event unless:

 

(i) the Company provides Parent with written information describing such
Intervening Event in reasonable detail as soon as reasonably practicable
after becoming aware of it;

(ii) the Company keeps Parent reasonably informed (orally and in writing) of
developments with respect to such Intervening Event;

(iii) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least four Business Days
before making an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such
Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifies the reasons
therefor; and

 

(iv) if Parent makes a written proposal during such four Business Day period
to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement (such written proposal
which shall be in a form that would create a binding contract if accepted by
the Company), the Company Board, after taking into consideration the adjusted
terms and conditions of this Agreement as proposed by Parent, continues to
determine in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the
failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law.

During the four Business Day period prior to its effecting an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement as referred to above, the
Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding
any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections 5.2(a)
and (b), the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of
receipt) advise Parent in writing in the event the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any indication by any Person that
it is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any inquiry or request
for information, discussion or negotiation that is reasonably likely to lead
to or that

 



39  contemplates an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any proposal or offer that is
or is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case
together with a description of the material terms and conditions of any such
indication, inquiry, request, proposal or offer, the identity of the Person
making any such indication, inquiry, request, proposal or offer, and a copy of
any written proposal, offer or draft agreement provided by such Person. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed (orally and in writing) in all
material respects on a timely basis of the status and details (including,
within 24 hours after the occurrence of any amendment, modification, material
development, material discussion or material negotiation) of any such
Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or offer, including
furnishing copies of any written inquiries, correspondence and draft
documentation, and written summaries of any material oral inquiries or
discussions. Without limiting any of the foregoing, the Company shall promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if it
determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal and shall in no event begin
providing such information or engaging in such discussions or negotiations
prior to providing such notice.

 

(d) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.2 by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 

(e) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that would restrict the Companys ability to comply with any of the
terms of this Section 5.2 and represents that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any such agreement.

 

(f) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from the restrictions on
"business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar
provision of any other Takeover Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not
to apply, or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case unless such
actions are taken substantially concurrently with a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(iii).

(g) Nothing contained in Section 5.2(a) shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_
,  _however_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change (including for purposes of Section 7.1(c)(ii)) unless
the Company Board expressly reaffirms its recommendation to the Companys
stockholders in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger in such
disclosure.

 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer with respect to any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, and whether through any merger, reorganization, consolidation,
tender offer,

 



40  self-tender, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture or otherwise, of (A) assets or businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that generate 10% or more of the net revenues or
net income or that represent 10% or more of the total assets (based on fair
market value) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
immediately prior to such transaction, or (B) 10% or more of any class of
capital stock, other equity securities or voting power of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any resulting parent company of the Company, in each
case other than the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide binding written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and its financial advisor), taking into account relevant
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the Person
making the proposal, including the financing terms thereof, is (A) more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view
than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by Parent in
response to such proposal) and (B) reasonably likely of being completed on the
terms proposed on a timely basis; _provided_ that, for purposes of
this definition of "Superior Proposal," references in the term "Acquisition
Proposal" to "10%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

 

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means a material event or circumstance that was
not known to the Company Board prior to the execution of this Agreement (or
if known, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable),
which event or circumstance, or any material consequence thereof, becomes
known to the Company Board prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the receipt,
existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto
or consequence thereof constitute an Intervening Event.

 

SECTION 5.3 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any
event within 15 Business Days after the date hereof), the Company shall file
the Proxy Statement with the SEC in preliminary form as required by the
Exchange Act, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy
Statement cleared by the SEC. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company the information relating to
it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall as
promptly as practicable provide Parent and Merger Sub with any comments that
may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, shall respond
as promptly as practicable to any such comments made by the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Proxy Statement, and shall cause the Proxy Statement in
definitive form to be mailed to the Companys stockholders at the earliest
practicable date. The Proxy Statement shall not, at the time it is
first mailed to the Companys stockholders, at the time of any amendments or
supplements thereto and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or

 



41  necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement shall comply as
to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act. If
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, any
information relating to the Merger, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates, directors or officers should be discovered by
the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not contain any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall as promptly as practicable notify the other parties hereto and the
Company shall as promptly as practicable file with the SEC an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the
stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing
or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall
give Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such document or response and shall give due consideration to
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel. The letter to stockholders, notice of meeting,
proxy statement and form of proxy and any other soliciting material to be
distributed to stockholders in connection with the Merger (including any
amendments or supplements) and any schedules required to be filed with the SEC
in connection therewith are collectively referred to as the " _Proxy
Statement_."

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof (and, in any event, no
later than the 10th Business Day hereafter), the Company shall, in
consultation with Parent, mail "broker search cards" with respect to the
Company Stockholders Meeting. As promptly as practicable after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Companys stockholders,
the Company shall, in consultation with Parent, establish a record date for,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") solely for the purpose
of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, it being understood that in
setting the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval. The Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting
from its originally noticed date for a reasonable period (i) in order to
solicit additional proxies so as to establish a quorum or (ii) to allow time
for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure
documents which the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) is necessary to be filed and
disseminated under applicable Law. Except in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change specifically permitted by Section 5.2, the Company,
through the Company Board, shall (i) recommend to its stockholders that they
adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to the first and second sentences of this paragraph (b)
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to the Company or any other Person of any Acquisition
Proposal or the occurrence of any Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

SECTION 5.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. From the date hereof
until the earlier of (x) the Effective Time and (y) the date of termination
of this Agreement, the

 



42  Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours to all their respective properties, assets,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records; _provided_ that (i) any
such access pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be coordinated through the
Company or its designated Representatives and (ii) Parent and its
Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operation of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable interference with the prompt
and timely discharge by the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries of
their normal duties. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Parent shall not
have access to personnel records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to individual performance or evaluation records or medical
histories, the disclosure of which to Parent would reasonably be expected to
subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to material liability. During
such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws, and (b) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent
or Merger Sub may reasonably request (including Tax Returns filed and those in
preparation and the workpapers of its auditors);  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not require the Company to disclose any information
to the extent such disclosure would contravene applicable Law or if such
disclosure would, based on the advice of such partys counsel, result in a
waiver of attorney-client privilege applicable to such information, it being
understood that the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not contravene
any applicable Law or result in violation of any such privilege. All such
information shall be held confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement between Lone Star U.S. Acquisitions, LLC and the
Company dated as of October 30, 2013 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").
No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4 or information provided, made
available or delivered to Parent pursuant to this Agreement shall affect any
of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the
conditions to the obligations, of the parties hereunder.

SECTION 5.5  _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take those
actions that are proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) obtain all
required consents, approvals or waivers from, and participate in discussions
or negotiations with, third parties, including as required under any Material

reasonably necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any
Action by, any Governmental Entity; and (vi) execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.

 



43 (b) The Company and Parent shall each be responsible for paying any fees and
other costs (including, but not limited to, legal and consultant fees)
incurred by that party in complying with this Section 5.5, including but not
limited to fees and other costs relating to the preparation of any filings or
submissions to any Governmental Entity.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 5.5(a), each party hereto
shall (i) cooperate with each other to determine whether any consents and
approvals (other than HSR Act filings) are required to be obtained from any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, (ii) subject to
confidentiality and legal requirements, coordinate and cooperate with each
other in exchanging information and providing such assistance as the other
parties may reasonably request in connection with seeking termination of any
applicable waiting periods including under the HSR Act and with obtaining any
other required consents and approvals, (iii) promptly notify the other parties
of any communication it or any of its members or Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement, (iv) subject to confidentiality and legal requirements, provide the
other parties a reasonable opportunity to review in advance any proposed
communication by such party to any Governmental Entity relating to the matters
that are the subject of this Agreement, (v) not agree to participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation
or other inquiry related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without providing prior notification to the other parties and an opportunity
to participate in any such meeting, subject to applicable confidentiality and
legal requirements, and (vi) furnish each other party with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between such party and its Affiliates and Representatives,
on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of their respective
staffs, on the other hand, concerning this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection
with obtaining required approvals under the HSR Act or other similar foreign
competition Laws, Parent shall be entitled, after consultation with the
Company, to make all strategic and tactical decisions as to the manner in
which to obtain any agreements with any Governmental Entity ( _provided_ that
any such agreements shall not restrict or otherwise impact the pre-
Closing operations of the Company), including but not limited to any decision
to make any filing or to enter any agreement with a Governmental Entity
regarding the timing of any investigation or waiting period relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of Parent and the Company shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable.

 

SECTION 5.6 _Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall (a) take
no action to cause any Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) if
any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby, take all action necessary to
ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Law
with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



44 SECTION 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any other notice or
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby, (c) any Action commenced or, to
such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or (d) any change,
condition or event that results or would reasonably be expected to result in
any failure of any condition set forth in Article VI to be satisfied
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall
affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies,
or the conditions to the obligations, of the parties hereunder.

 

SECTION 5.8 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification existing in
favor of the current or former directors and officers of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") as provided in the Company
Charter or Company Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in any
indemnification agreement as in effect on the date of this Agreement and
which is included in the Company SEC Documents and set forth in Schedule
5.8(a), for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time shall be
assumed and performed by the Surviving Corporation and shall continue in
full force and effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations or, in the case of any indemnification agreement, in accordance
with its terms, with respect to any claims against such directors or officers
arising out of such acts or omissions, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance covering each Indemnified Person currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a correct and
complete copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent) for acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that (i) Parent
may substitute therefor policies of an insurance company the material terms
of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable to such
Indemnified Persons than the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, and (ii) in lieu of the Surviving Corporation maintaining in effect
such current liability insurance, the Company may obtain, as of the Effective
Time and for six years after the Effective Time, prepaid (or "tail")
directors and officers liability insurance policies (the " _Tail Policy_ ")
in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time,
including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, covering each
person covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
policies in effect on the date of this Agreement (the " _Existing D andO
Policies_"), on the same terms as the Existing DandO Policies or, if such
insurance coverage is unavailable, coverage that is no less favorable to such
persons than the coverage under the Existing DandO Policies, and with aggregate
premiums for the six year period not in excess of $1,500,000 or such greater
amount as is agreed to in writing by Parent; and _provided_ _further_ that,
if the Tail Policy is not purchased, in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation or the Company be required to pay annual premiums for insurance
under this Section 5.8 in excess of 250% of the 

 



45  amount of the annual premiums paid by the Company for fiscal year 2014 for
such purpose (which fiscal year 2014 premiums are set forth in Schedule 5.8),
it being understood that the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall
nevertheless be obligated to provide as much coverage as may be obtained for
such 250% amount. If the Tail Policy is obtained by the Company, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) use
its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full
force and effect, for the full term of the policy, and to honor all of its
obligations thereunder.

 

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person against all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments and fines (and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred in
connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified
Person is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law;  _provided_ that the
foregoing indemnification shall be unavailable if the Indemnified Person is
determined in a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have failed to act in good faith and in a manner
such Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of
the Company or, in the case of a criminal action or proceeding, to have had
reasonable cause to believe that such Indemnified Persons conduct was
unlawful. In the event of any such Action, each Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of such Action;
_provided_ that any Indemnified Person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. In the
event of any such Action, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with
the Indemnified Person in the defense of any such Action and (ii) the
Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any Action pending or threatened in writing to which an
Indemnified Person is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could
be sought by such Indemnified Person hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Person from all liability arising out of such Action.

 

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause proper provision to be made so that any successor and assign of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.8.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her legal
representatives.

 



46 SECTION 5.9 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent agrees to use, and to cause Merger Sub to use, reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Financing Commitments (including any flex and securities
demand provisions described in the related fee letter) in order to consummate
the Merger as soon as possible after the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions contained in the Financing Commitments, (ii) satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the
Financing Commitments that are within its or any of its Affiliates control,
(iii) comply with its obligations thereunder and (iv) not take or fail to take
any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede or delay
the availability of the Financing. Parent agrees to use, and to cause Merger
Sub to use, reasonable best efforts to enforce their respective rights under
the Financing Commitments and the definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Financing and Equity Financing, _provided_ that reasonable best efforts
will not be interpreted to require Parent or Merger Sub to, and neither Parent
nor Merger Sub shall be required to, sue the Financing Sources to enforce or
commence any other legal proceeding in relation to the Financing Commitments.
Parent shall not, and shall cause Merger Sub not to, without the prior written
consent of the Company, terminate the Equity Financing Commitment, or permit
any amendment, modification or supplement to (except for any amendment,
modification or supplement that would increase the amount thereof or otherwise
would not be adverse to the Company in any material respect), or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, or replace, the Equity Financing
Commitment. Parent shall not, and shall cause Merger Sub not to, without the
prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), amend, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify, or waive any of its rights under, any Debt Financing Commitment,
unless such Debt Financing Commitment is amended, replaced, supplemented or
otherwise modified, or the Parents rights thereunder are waived, in a manner
consistent with the following sentence. Parent is permitted to enter into, or
cause Merger Sub to enter into, any amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification of the Debt Financing Commitment, or waive any of its
rights under the Debt Financing (including any substitute debt financing for
all or any portion of the Debt Financing from the same or alternative
Financing Sources) without the prior written consent of the Company if such
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver or
replacement (A) does not add new or modify any existing conditions precedent
to the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment in any
respect that would make such conditions materially less likely to be
satisfied by the Closing Date (it being understood and agreed that the joinder
of any financial institutions to the Debt Financing Commitment as "Additional
Arrangers" and/or "Additional Initial Lenders" and the right of such
financial institutions to be satisfied with the satisfaction of existing
conditions precedent to the Debt Financing shall not constitute the addition
or modification of any existing condition precedent) and (B) is not
reasonably expected to prevent or materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, prior written consent of the Company
will not be required for Parent to exercise any options existing under the

 



47  Debt Financing Commitments (other than termination of the Debt Financing
Commitment or amendment thereof, except as otherwise permitted by this Section
5.9), including, without limitation, (i) the ability to increase the amount
of the ABL Facility (as defined in the Debt Financing Commitments) from
$100,000,000 to $125,000,000 and (ii) assigning its rights and obligations
under the Debt Financing Commitments to one or more of its subsidiaries or
affiliates, including Merger Sub (in the case of which assignment, all
references in this Section 5.9 to "Parent" shall be deemed replaced by
references to such subsidiaries or affiliates). Parent shall be permitted to
reduce the amount of Debt Financing under the Debt Financing Commitments in
its reasonable discretion, _provided_ that Parent shall not reduce the Debt
Financing to an amount committed below the amount that is required,
together with the Equity Financing and all other financial resources of
Parent and Merger Sub including cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries
on the Closing Date, to consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement, and provided further, that such reduction shall not (I) add
new or modify any existing conditions precedent to the Debt Financing as set
forth in the Debt Financing Commitments in any respect that would make such
conditions materially less likely to be satisfied by the Closing Date or (II)
be reasonably expected to prevent or materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For purposes of this Section 5.9, references to "Debt Financing"
shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments as
permitted to be amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, or
waived, substituted or reduced as contemplated by this paragraph (a) and
references to "Debt Financing Commitments" shall include such documents as
permitted to be amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, or
waived, substituted or reduced as contemplated by this paragraph (a). The
syndication of the Debt Financing, including the appointment of additional
arrangers and initial lenders thereunder, to the extent permitted by the Debt
Financing Commitments shall not be deemed to violate Parents obligations
under this Agreement. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any
breach or repudiation by any party to the Financing Commitments or the
Financing Documents or any condition not likely to be satisfied, in each
case, of which Parent obtains knowledge, or any waiver, amendment or
modification of the Financing Commitments or the Financing Documents. Without
limiting Parents other obligations under this Section 5.9, if a Financing
Failure Event (as defined below) occurs Parent shall (i) promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) notify the Company of such Financing Failure Event and
the reasons therefor of which Parent has knowledge, (ii) in consultation with
the Company, use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing on
terms not materially less beneficial in the aggregate to Parent (as determined
in the reasonable judgment of Parent, taking into account the flex provisions
set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments) from alternative financing
sources in an amount sufficient, together with the Equity Financing and all
other financial resources of Parent and Merger Sub including cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and
the Companys Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event but in no event later than
the date of the Closing contemplated in Section 1.2, and (iii) use reasonable
best efforts to obtain, and when obtained, provide the Company with a copy of
a new financing commitment that provides for such alternative financing.
Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its effort to arrange the Financing and
shall provide to the

 



48  Company copies of all material agreements related to the Financing. "
_Financing Failure Event_ " shall mean any of the following: (a) the
commitments with respect to all or any portion of the Financing expiring or
being terminated; (b) for any reason, all or any portion of the Financing
becoming unavailable; or (c) a repudiation of the Debt Financing Commitments
by any party thereto.

 

(b) In the event that on the final day of the Marketing Period, (i) all or any
portion of the Debt Financing structured as Bond Financing has not been
consummated, (ii) all closing conditions contained in Article VI shall have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature
will not be satisfied until the Closing), and (iii) the Bridge Financing
is available on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing
Commitments (or replacements thereof, as contemplated by the preceding
paragraph), then Merger Sub shall borrow under and use the proceeds of the
Bridge Financing (or such alternative bridge financing) to replace such
affected portion of the Bond Financing no later than two Business Days after
the last day of the Marketing Period. " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the
first period of 15 consecutive Business Days after the date hereof throughout
and at the end of which (A) Parent and its Financing Sources shall have the
Required Information and during which period such Required Information shall
remain compliant at all times with all applicable provisions of Regulation
S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and the provisions of this
Section 5.9, _provided_ that if the Company shall in good faith reasonably
believe it has provided and has continued to provide the Required
Information, it may deliver to Parent a written notice to that effect (stating
when it believes it completed such delivery), in which case the Company shall
be deemed to have delivered the Required Information unless Parent in
good faith reasonably believes the Company has not completed the delivery of
the Required Information and, within three Business Days after the delivery of
such notice by the Company, delivers a written notice to the Company to that
effect (stating with reasonable specificity which Required Information the
Company has not delivered); (B) nothing has occurred and no condition exists
that would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2 to fail to be
satisfied if the Closing were to be held at any time during such 15 Business
Day period; and (C) the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 shall be
satisfied; _provided_ that (1) the Marketing Period (I) shall exclude July 4,
2014 through and including July 7, 2014 (it being understood that such days
shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating the consecutive days
consisting of the Marketing Period, but shall not disqualify any period
including such days from being "consecutive") and (II) must occur either
entirely before or entirely after the period from and including August 15,
2014 through and including September 1, 2014; (2) the Marketing Period shall
not be deemed to have commenced if, prior to the completion of the Marketing
Period, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm shall have
withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any of the financial statements
contained in the Company SEC Documents or the Required Information, in which
case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence unless and until, at
the earliest, a new unqualified audit opinion is issued with respect to the
consolidated financial statements of the Company for the applicable periods
by the Companys independent registered accounting firm, another "big four"
accounting firm or another independent public accounting firm reasonably
acceptable to Parent; (3) if the financial statements included in the
Required Information that are available to Parent on the first day of any such
15 Business Day period would not be sufficiently current on any day during
such period to permit a registration statement using such
financial statements to be declared effective by the SEC on the last day of
such period, then such Marketing Period shall not begin until the

 



49  first day thereafter when this clause (3) shall not be applicable and the
other terms and conditions of this definition will be satisfied, (4) the
Marketing Period shall not be deemed to have commenced if, prior to
completion of the Marketing Period, the Company has issued a public statement
indicating its intent to restate the historical financial statements of the
Company or that any such restatement is under consideration or may be a
possibility, in which case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to
commence until such restatement has been completed and the relevant Company
SEC Document or Company SEC Documents have been amended or the Company has
announced that it has concluded that no restatement shall be required under
GAAP, and (5) the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date on which the
Debt Financing is consummated.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives, including legal, tax, regulatory and accounting, to, at
Parents expense (such expenses to be reasonable), provide to Parent and
Merger Sub all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and/or the Financing
Sources that is necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Debt
Financing ( _provided_ that such request is consistent with applicable Law and
does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in a way that is not customary in connection with the
arrangement of financing similar to the Financing), including (i)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-
one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and
prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Debt Financing and the Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and
General Counsel of the Company and other members of senior management
and Representatives of the Company), presentations, road shows, due diligence
and drafting sessions and sessions with prospective Financing Sources,
investors and rating agencies, and reasonably cooperating with the marketing
efforts of Parent and Merger Sub and their Financing Sources, in each case in
connection with all or any portion of the Debt Financing, (ii) assisting with
the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering
documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, business
projections, lender and investor presentations, prospectuses and similar
documents required in connection with the Debt Financing, including execution
and delivery of customary representation letters in connection with bank
information memoranda, (iii) as promptly as reasonably practical, furnishing
Parent, Merger Sub and the Financing Sources with financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may
be reasonably requested by Parent, including (A) all audited financial
statements, all unaudited financial statements (which shall have been reviewed
by the independent accountants for the Company, as the case may be, as
provided in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Codification
System Section 722), pro forma financial information prepared in accordance
with, or reconciled to, GAAP, financial data, audit reports and other
information of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under
the Securities Act for public offerings of non-convertible debt securities on
Form S-1 (or any applicable successor form) under the Securities Act, which is
customarily included in offering documents used in private placements
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act (including, to the extent
applicable with respect to such financial statements, the report of the
Companys auditors thereon and related management discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations), as necessary or appropriate
to consummate the offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments, assuming that such public offering(s) were consummated
at the same time during the Companys fiscal year as the

 



50  offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments ( _provided_ that in no circumstance shall the Company be required
to provide subsidiary financial statements or any other information of the
type required by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X,
Compensation Disclosure and Analysis required by Regulation S-K Item 402(b) or
other information customarily excluded from a Rule 144A offering memorandum),
or as otherwise required in connection with the Debt Financing and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) such other information as
required by Sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 of Exhibit C to the Debt
Financing Commitments, including any information reasonably necessary in
order to receive customary "comfort" (including "negative assurance" comfort)
from independent accountants in connection with the offering(s) of debt
securities contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments or with respect to
the financial statements and data referred to in sub-clause (A) above (all
such information in this clause (iii), the " _Required Information_ "), (iv)
no later than the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement, satisfying the
conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments (to the extent the
satisfaction of such conditions requires actions by or cooperation of the
Company), (v) using reasonable best efforts to obtain customary accountants
comfort letters and consents to the use of accountants audit reports relating
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, legal opinions, hedging agreements,
appraisals, surveys, engineering reports, title insurance and other
documentation and items required by the Debt Financing Commitments or as are
reasonably requested by Parent and, if requested by Parent or Merger Sub,
cooperating with and assisting Parent or Merger Sub in obtaining such
documentation and items, (vi) using its reasonable best efforts to provide
monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) to the extent the Company
customarily prepares such financial statements within 25 days of the end of
each month prior to the Closing Date, (vii) executing and delivering, as of
the Effective Time, any definitive financing documents, including any credit
or purchase agreements, indentures, guarantees, pledge agreements, security
agreements, mortgages, deeds of trust and other security documents or other
certificates, documents and instruments relating to guarantees, the pledge of
collateral and other matters ancillary to the Debt Financing (including a
certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to
solvency matters and consents of accountants for use of their reports in any
materials relating to the Debt Financing) as may be reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Debt Financing and otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral (including cooperation in connection
with the pay-off of existing Indebtedness, the release of related Liens and
the registration of Dollar Financial UK Holding PLC as a private limited
company), and the replacement or backing of any outstanding letter of credit
maintained or provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries effective as of the
Closing Date, (viii) taking all actions necessary to permit the Financing
Sources to conduct audit examinations, appraisals and other evaluations with
respect to the Companys and its Subsidiaries current assets and other
collateral, and to evaluate its cash management and accounting systems,
policies and procedures relating thereto for the purposes of establishing
collateral arrangements, and (ix) taking all corporate actions necessary to
permit the consummation of the Debt Financing and to permit the proceeds
thereof, together with the cash at the Company and its Subsidiaries, to be
made available to Parent on the Closing Date to consummate the Merger;
_provided_ , _however_ , that irrespective of the above, no obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate, document or
instrument relating to the Debt Financing shall be effective until the
Effective Time and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to take any action (A) under any certificate, document or instrument
relating to the Debt Financing that is not contingent upon the

 



51  Closing (including the entry into any agreement that is effective before the
Effective Time) or (B) that would reasonably be expected to cause any
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
incur any personal liability relating the Debt Financing. The Company will
periodically update Required Information to be included in an offering
document to be used in connection with the Debt Financing in order to ensure
that the Required Information does not contain any untrue statement of
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements contained therein not misleading. The Company hereby consents
to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt
Financing, _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 5.9 or in any
provision of this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be
required (i) to amend or waive any of the terms or conditions hereof or (ii)
except as agreed by Parent in its sole discretion as specified in Section 1.2,
to consummate the Closing any earlier than two Business Days after the final
day of the Marketing Period.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required, under
the provisions of this Section 5.9 or otherwise in connection with the Debt
Financing, to pay any commitment or other similar fee prior to the Effective
Time that is not advanced or substantially simultaneously reimbursed by
Parent. Parent shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with (A) any action taken
by them at the request of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 5.9 or
in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or (B) any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided
by the Company or its Subsidiaries), except to the extent such losses arise

of its Subsidiaries. Nothing contained in this Section or otherwise
shall require the Company to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to

(f) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing, and
each of Parent and Merger Sub reaffirms its obligation to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement subject only
to the express conditions set forth in Article VI, irrespective and
independent of the availability or terms of the Financing or any alternate
financing.

SECTION 5.10 _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other

under Rule 16b3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

SECTION 5.12 _Directors_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause
each member of the Company Board to execute and deliver a letter effectuating

Parent shall have no liability with respect to the Companys performance of
its obligations under the 2017 Notes Indenture, the 2027 Notes Indenture, the
2028 Notes Indenture, or the Convertible Notes, including the Companys
obligation to deliver or cause to be delivered any notice thereunder.

(b) _Convertible Notes_.

 

(i) _Fundamental Change_. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that the
Closing will result in a Fundamental Change (as defined in each of the 2017
Notes Indenture, the 2027 Notes Indenture and the 2028 Notes Indenture). The
parties agree and acknowledge that the Merger Consideration is less than the
Applicable Conversion Price (as defined in each of the 2017 Notes Indenture,
the 2027 Notes Indenture, and the 2028 Notes Indenture) and that no "make
whole premium" (as defined in each of the 2017 Notes Indenture, the 2027 Notes
Indenture, and the 2028 Notes Indenture) or any other payment will be due to
the holders of the Convertible Notes under the terms of the 2017 Notes
Indenture, the 2027 Notes Indenture and the 2028 Notes Indenture in connection
with the Merger other than the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price (as defined
in each of the 2017 Notes Indenture, the 2027 Notes Indenture, and the 2028
Notes Indenture).

(ii) _Debt Tender Offers_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the

to commence offers to purchase and/or consent solicitations related to any or
all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of, and all other amounts
due pursuant to or under, any or all of the Convertible Notes, on such terms
and conditions, including pricing terms, that are specified and requested,
from time to time, by Parent (each a " _Debt Tender Offer_ " and

 



53  collectively, the " _Debt Tender Offers_ "), and Parent shall assist the
Company in connection therewith; _provided_ that the Companys counsel shall
provide such legal opinions as may be reasonably requested by Parent that are
customary or necessary in connection with the Debt Tender Offers; and
_provided_ _further_ that Parent shall only request the Company to conduct any
Debt Tender Offer in compliance with the documents governing the applicable
Convertible Notes and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule
14e-1 under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the closing of
the Debt Tender Offers shall be conditioned on the consummation of the
Closing, and the parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause the Debt Tender Offers to close on the Closing Date. Subject to the
preceding sentence, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Debt Tender Offers, including using reasonable
best efforts to assist in the preparation of the Offer Documents. On the date
of commencement of the Debt Tender Offers, the Company shall file with the
SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Debt Tender Offer
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ "), which shall include, as exhibits, an offer to purchase and a
related letter of transmittal, a summary advertisement and other ancillary
Debt Tender Offer documents pursuant to which the Debt Tender Offer will be
made (such Schedule TO and the documents attached as exhibits thereto,
together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_
"). Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect,
and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the
Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or
supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of the
Convertible Notes, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Offer Documents, and shall provide Parent
with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to give the Parent the opportunity to participate in any
substantive telephonic or in-person communications with the staff of the SEC
related thereto. The Company (i) shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt
Tender Offers (other than the occurrence of the Closing) and make any change
to the Debt Tender Offers, in each case, as may be reasonably requested by
Parent and (ii) shall not, without the written consent of Parent, waive any
condition to the Debt Tender Offers or make any changes to the Debt Tender
Offers. Parent shall ensure that at the Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation has all funds necessary to pay for the Convertible Notes that have
been properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Tender Offers.
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that neither the pendency nor the
consummation of any Debt Tender Offer is a condition to Parents or Merger
Subs obligations to consummate the Merger. The dealer manager, solicitation
agent, information agent, depositary, paying agent and any other agents (the
" _Debt Tender Agents_ ") retained in connection with the Debt Tender Offers

 



54  shall be selected by Parent. The Company shall enter into customary
agreements (including indemnities) with the Debt Tender Agents so selected and
on terms and conditions acceptable to Parent. 

(iii) _Section 10.06 Supplemental Indenture and Fundamental Change
Documentation_. Concurrently with the Closing, if any Convertible Notes
remain outstanding after giving effect to the closing of the Debt Tender
Offers, in Parents sole discretion, Parent may cause the Company to (i) issue
and cause to be executed by the requisite parties a supplemental indenture
(each, a " _Section 10.06 Supplemental Indenture_ ") in accordance with
Section 10.06 of each of the 2017 Notes Indenture, the 2027 Notes Indenture
and the 2028 Notes Indenture, providing for the conversion and settlement of
the Convertible Notes as set forth in the 2017 Notes Indenture, the 2027 Notes
Indenture and the 2028 Notes Indenture, respectively, and (ii) comply with the
applicable provisions of the 2017 Notes Indenture, the 2027 Notes Indenture
and the 2028 Notes Indenture, including the notice requirements of Section
10.06 set forth in each such indenture.

 

(iv) _Purchase and Conversion_. On or after the Closing if any Convertible
Notes remain outstanding after giving effect to the closing of the Debt
Tender Offers, in Parents sole discretion, Parent may cause the Surviving
Corporation to (i) make an offer to repurchase the Convertible Notes as
required by Section 3.02 of the 2017 Notes Indenture, the 2027 Notes
Indenture and the 2028 Notes Indenture, as applicable, and to repurchase any
such notes tendered in connection with the offer and (ii) consummate the
conversion and settlement of any Convertible Notes that are converted as set
forth in Section 10.06 of the applicable indenture and each Section 10.06
Supplemental Indenture.

cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the

subsidiary of the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of the
Indenture dated December 23, 2009 governing the 2016 Notes (the " _2016 Notes
Indenture_ "), (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee (as
defined in the 2016 Notes Indenture) to agree to proceed with the redemption
of the 2016 Notes on notice of at least 45 days (or such shorter period as
each such Trustee may agree to) before the redemption date, which notice may
be subject to the consummation of the Closing, and use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Trustee to provide the notice of redemption to the holders of
the 2016 Notes following the Closing on the Closing Date, (iii) provide Parent
the reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each of the foregoing
notices reasonably in advance of their delivery, (iv) use its reasonable best
efforts to take all other actions and prepare and deliver all other documents
(including any officers certificates and legal opinions) as may be required
under the 2016 Notes Indenture to issue an irrevocable notice of redemption
of the 2016 Notes following the Closing on the Closing Date

 



55  (subject to the irrevocable deposit with the Trustee on the Closing Date of
funds sufficient to pay in full the outstanding aggregate principal amount of,
accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date on, and applicable
premiums related to, such 2016 Notes, as arranged by Parent) providing for the
redemption 30 days after the Closing Date of all of the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of the 2016 Notes (together with all accrued and unpaid
interest and applicable premiums related to such 2016 Notes) pursuant to the

best efforts to negotiate a payoff letter, at least three Business Days in
advance of the Closing Date, from the administrative agent of the Credit
Agreement, dated October 25, 2013 (the " _Existing Credit Agreement_ ") among
the Company, certain of its Subsidiaries, the lenders and agents party
thereto and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as administrative agent and
security trustee. In consultation with Parent and Merger Sub, the Company
shall, and cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) terminate on the Closing Date
the Existing Credit Agreement and all related loan documents to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, including, without limitation,
any security, guarantee or pledge documents and (ii) cause to be released

indirectly) make all payments required pursuant to the payoff letter to effect
such termination and releases.

by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied;

 

(ii) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to complete the Closing by the date the
Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 1.2;

(iii) all of the conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing provided

(iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the
Closing will occur.

(c) Nothing in this Section 8.10 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall require
Parent or Merger Sub to initiate, prosecute or maintain any Action against
any Financing Source or the other Persons providing or obligated to provide
the Debt Financing in the event of any breach or purported breach of the Debt
Financing Commitments by any such Financing Source or other Person.

(d) Each of the parties hereby waives (a) any defense in any action for
specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any
requirement under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

 

SECTION 8.11 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not

 



72  affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives
its rights under this Section with respect thereto. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

SECTION 8.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING THOSE
CONTEMPLATED BY SECTION 8.8(C)).

 

SECTION 8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other party. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic image
scan transmission shall be effective as delivery of an original counterpart
hereof. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication).

SECTION 8.14 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this
Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is expressly
waived.

ARTICLE II

 

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

 

Section 2.1 _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of stockholders, for the
election of directors and for the transaction of such other business as may
properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place, if any, either
within or without the State of Delaware, on such date, and at such time as the
Board of Directors shall fix. The Board of Directors may postpone, reschedule
or cancel any annual meeting of stockholders previously scheduled by the Board
of Directors.

Section 2.2 _Special Meeting_. Except as otherwise required by law, and
except as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the Certificate of
Incorporation a special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation: (i)
may be called at any time by the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the

Directors or the Secretary of the Corporation upon the written request or
requests of one or more stockholders of record that, at the time a request is
delivered, hold shares representing at least 10% of the voting power of the
stock entitled to vote on the matter or matters to be brought before the
proposed special meeting. Except as otherwise required by law, and except
as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the Certificate of
Incorporation, special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation may not
be called by any other person or persons. Only such business shall be
conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought
before the meeting pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting. If none of
the stockholders who submitted the special meeting request (or their qualified
representatives) appears at the special meeting to present the matter or
matters to be brought before the special meeting that were specified  in the special meeting request(s), the Corporation need not present the
matter or matters for a vote at the meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in
respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation.

Section 2.3 _Notice of Stockholders  Meetings_.

 

(a) Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a
meeting, notice of the place, if any, date, and time of the meeting of
stockholders, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to
vote at the meeting (if such date is different from the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting) and the means
of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may
be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, shall be given.
The notice shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the
date on which the meeting is to be held, to each stockholder entitled to vote
at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders
entitled to notice of the meeting, except as otherwise provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws. In the case of a special
meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called also shall be
set forth in the notice. Notice may be given personally, by mail or by
electronic transmission in accordance with Section 232 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). If mailed,
such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail,
postage prepaid, directed to each stockholder at such stockholders address as
it appears on the records of the Corporation. Notice by electronic
transmission shall be deemed given as provided in Section 232 of the DGCL. An
affidavit that notice has been given, executed by the Secretary of the
Corporation, Assistant Secretary or any transfer agent or other agent of the
Corporation, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the notice
in the absence of fraud. Notice shall be deemed to have been given to all
stockholders who share an address if notice is given in accordance with
Section 233 of the DGCL.

(b) When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not
be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, if any, date and time
thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders
and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such
adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the adjournment is for more than 30
days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of
record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record
date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the
Board of Directors shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned
meeting in accordance with _Section 7.5_, and shall give notice of the
adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such
adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned
meeting.

 

Section 2.4 _Organization_.

 

(a) Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the
Board of Directors, if any, or in his or her absence, by the Chief Executive
Officer or, in his or her absence, by another person designated by the Board
of Directors. The

 



2  Secretary of the Corporation, or in his or her absence, an Assistant
Secretary, or in the absence of the Secretary and all Assistant Secretaries, a
person whom the chairman of the meeting shall appoint, shall act as secretary
of the meeting and keep a record of the proceedings thereof.

(b) The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each
matter upon which the stockholders shall vote at a meeting of stockholders
shall be announced at the meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt such rules
and regulations for the conduct of any meeting of stockholders as it shall
deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and
regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of the meeting
shall have the authority to adopt and enforce such rules and regulations for
the conduct of any meeting of stockholders and the safety of those in
attendance as, in the judgment of the chairman, are necessary, appropriate or
convenient for the conduct of the meeting. Rules and regulations for the
conduct of meetings of stockholders, whether adopted by the Board of
Directors or by the chairman of the meeting, may include without limitation,
establishing: (i) an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules
and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those
present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, their duly authorized and
constituted proxies and such other persons as the chairman of the meeting
shall permit; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed
for the commencement thereof; (v) limitations on the time allotted for
consideration of each agenda item and for questions and comments by
participants; (vi) regulations for the opening and closing of the polls for
balloting and matters which are to be voted on by ballot (if any); and (vii)
procedures (if any) requiring attendees to provide the Corporation advance
notice of their intent to attend the meeting. Subject to any rules and
regulations adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of the meeting may
convene and, for any or no reason, from time to time, adjourn and/or recess
any meeting of stockholders pursuant to  _Section 2.7_. The chairman of the
meeting, in addition to making any other determinations that may be
appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall have the power and duty to
declare that a nomination or other business was not properly brought before
the meeting if the facts warrant, and if such chairman should so declare, such
nomination shall be disregarded or such other business shall not be
transacted.

 

Section 2.5 _List of Stockholders_. The officer who has charge of the stock
ledger shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the date of the
meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the
10th day before the meeting date. Such list shall be arranged in alphabetical
order and shall show the address of each stockholder and the number of shares
registered in the name of each stockholder. Nothing in this _Section 2.5_
shall require the Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other
electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting at
least 10 days prior to the meeting (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic
network, _provided_ that the information required to gain access to such list
is provided with the notice of meeting or (b) during ordinary business hours
at the principal place of business of the Corporation.

 



3  In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on
an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure
that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation.
If the meeting is to be held at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled
to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the
meeting during the whole time thereof and may be examined by any stockholder
who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote
communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any
stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such
list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Except as otherwise
required by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the
stockholders entitled to examine the list of stockholders required by this
_Section 2.5_ or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of
stockholders.

 

Section 2.6 _Quorum_. Except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, at any meeting of stockholders, a majority of
the voting power of the stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting,
present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business. If a quorum is not present or represented at any
meeting of stockholders, then the chairman of the meeting, or a majority of
the voting power of the stock present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote thereon, shall have power to adjourn or
recess the meeting from time to time in accordance with _Section 2.7_, until
a quorum is present or represented. Subject to applicable law, if a quorum
initially is present at any meeting of stockholders, the stockholders may
continue to transact business until adjournment or recess, notwithstanding
the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, but if a
quorum is not present at least initially, no business other than adjournment
or recess may be transacted.

 

Section 2.7 _Adjourned or Recessed Meeting_. Any annual or special meeting of
stockholders, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned or
recessed for any reason from time to time by the chairman of the meeting,
subject to any rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Directors
pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_, and may be adjourned for any reason from time
to time by a majority of the voting power of the stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. At any such
adjourned or recessed meeting at which a quorum may be present, any business
may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as
originally called.

Section 2.8 _Voting_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation,
each holder of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such stock held
of record by such holder that has voting power upon the subject matter in
question.

 

(b) Except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation,
these Bylaws or any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Corporation or
its securities, at each meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present,
all corporate actions to be taken by vote of the stockholders shall be
authorized by the affirmative vote

  



4  of at least a majority of the voting power of the stock present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter. Voting at
meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot.

Section 2.9 _Proxies_. Every stockholder entitled to vote for directors, or on
any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or
more persons authorized to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such
proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the
proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states
that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an
interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may
revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting
in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of
the proxy or executed new proxy bearing a later date.

 

Section 2.10 _Action by Written Consent_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of
the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be
taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may
be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a
consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, are signed
by the holders of the outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
To be effective, a written consent must be delivered to the Corporation by
delivery to its registered agent in the State of Delaware. Delivery made to
the Corporations registered office shall be by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested. Every written consent shall bear
the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent, and no
written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to
therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated consent delivered in the
manner required by this _Section 2.10_ to the Corporation, written consents
signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the
Corporation in accordance with this _Section 2.10_.

 

(b) Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by
less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who
have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a
meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date
for notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by
a sufficient number of stockholders to take the action were delivered to the
Corporation in the manner required by this _Section 2.10_.

 

Section 2.11 _Meetings by Remote Communications_. The Board of Directors may,
in its sole discretion, determine that a meeting of stockholders shall not be
held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote
communication in accordance with Section 211(a)(2) of the DGCL. If authorized
by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to
such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt,
stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of
stockholders may, by means of remote communication (a) participate in a
meeting of stockholders and (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a
meeting of stockholders whether such

 



5  meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote
communication, _provided_ that (i) the Corporation shall implement reasonable
measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at
the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder;
(ii) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such
stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an
opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially
concurrently with such proceedings; and (iii) if any stockholder or
proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote
communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by
the Corporation.

by the stockholders.

 

Section 3.2 _Number, Term of Office and Election_. Except as otherwise
provided for or fixed pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board

of directors then authorized. At any meeting of stockholders at which
directors are to be elected, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the
votes cast. Each director shall hold office until the next election of
directors and until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and
qualified. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, wherein other qualifications for
directors may be prescribed.

 

Section 3.3 _Vacancies_. Unless otherwise required by law, newly created
directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of
directors and any vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause
may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors
then in office and entitled to vote thereon, even though less than a quorum,
or by the sole remaining director, or by the stockholders. Any director so
chosen shall hold office until the next election of directors and until his or
her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.

Section 3.4 _Resignations and Removal_.

 

(a) Any director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or by
electronic transmission to the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board
of Directors or the Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation shall take
effect upon

 



6  delivery, unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or time or
an effective date or time determined upon the happening of an event or events.
Unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall
not be necessary to make it effective.

(b) Unless otherwise restricted by law, any director or the entire Board of
Directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of at
least a majority of the voting power of the stock outstanding and entitled to
vote thereon.

 

Section 3.5 _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors

Section 3.6 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of Directors for
any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Chairman of the
Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or a majority of the directors
then in office. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings of
the Board of Directors may fix the place, within or without the State
of Delaware, date and time of such meetings. Notice of each such meeting
shall be given to each director, if by mail, addressed to such director at his
or her residence or usual place of business, at least five days before the day
on which such meeting is to be held, or shall be sent to such director by
electronic transmission, or be delivered personally or by telephone, in each
case at least 24 hours prior to the time set for such meeting. A notice of
special meeting need not state the purpose of such meeting, and, unless
indicated in the notice thereof, any and all business may be transacted at a
special meeting.

Section 3.7  _Participation in Meetings by Conference Telephone_. Members of
the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may participate in a
meeting of such Board of Directors or committee by means of conference
telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons
participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation shall
constitute presence in person at such meeting.

 

Section 3.8 _Quorum and Voting_. Except as otherwise required by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a majority of the affirmative
vote of a majority of the total number of directors then authorized shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the
Board of Directors, and the vote of a majority of the directors present at a
duly held meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board
of Directors. The chairman of the meeting or a majority of the directors
present may adjourn the meeting to another time and place whether or not a
quorum is present. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as
originally called.

 

Section 3.9 _Board of Directors Action by Written Consent without a Meeting_.
Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the
Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting,
_provided_ that all members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the
case may be, consent in writing or by electronic transmission to such action,
and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or

 



7  transmissions are filed with the minutes or proceedings of the Board of
Directors or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are
maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are
maintained in electronic form.

Section 3.10 _Chairman of the Board_. The Chairman of the Board shall preside
at meetings of stockholders and directors and shall perform such other duties
as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. If the Chairman of
the Board is not present at a meeting of the Board of Directors,

Section 3.11 _Rules and Regulations_. The Board of Directors may adopt such
rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws for the conduct of its meetings
and management of the affairs of the Corporation as the Board of Directors
shall deem proper. 

Section 3.12 _Fees and Compensation of Directors_. Directors may receive such
compensation, if any, for their services on the Board of Directors and its
committees, and such reimbursement of expenses, as may be fixed or determined
by resolution of the Board of Directors.

catastrophe, as referred to in Section 110 of the DGCL, or other similar
emergency condition, as a result of which a quorum of the Board of Directors
or a standing committee of the Board of Directors cannot readily be convened
for action, then the director or directors in attendance at the meeting shall
constitute a quorum. Such director or directors in attendance may further take
action to appoint one or more of themselves or other directors to membership
on any standing or temporary committees of the Board of Directors as they
shall deem necessary and appropriate.

or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members present
at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he, she or
they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board
of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or
disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent permitted by law and
provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors establishing such
committee, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the
Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the
Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to
all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power
or authority in reference to (a) approving or adopting, or recommending to the
stockholders, any action or matter (other than the election or removal of
directors) expressly required by 

 



8  the DGCL to be submitted to stockholders for approval or (b) adopting,
amending or repealing any bylaw of the Corporation. All committees of the
Board of Directors shall keep minutes of their meetings and shall report
their proceedings to the Board of Directors when requested or required by the
Board of Directors.

 

Section 4.2 _Meetings and Action of Committees_. Unless the Board of Directors
provides otherwise by resolution, any committee of the Board of Directors may
adopt, alter and repeal such rules and regulations not inconsistent with the
provisions of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws for the
conduct of its meetings as such committee may deem proper.

ARTICLE VI

 

INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES

 

Section 6.1 _Indemnification_

 

(a) Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to,
or was or is otherwise involved in, any action, suit, arbitration,
alternative dispute mechanism, inquiry, judicial, administrative or
legislative hearing, investigation or any other threatened, pending or
completed proceeding, whether brought by or in the right of the Corporation or
otherwise, including any and all appeals, whether of a civil, criminal,
administrative, legislative, investigative or other nature (hereinafter a "
_proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
an officer of the Corporation or while a director or officer of the
Corporation is or was serving at the request of the

 



11  Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "
_indemnitee_ "), or by reason of anything done or not done by him or her in
any such capacity, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation
to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss (including
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts
paid in settlement by or on behalf of the indemnitee) actually and reasonably
incurred by such indemnitee in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, except as otherwise required by law or provided in _Section 6.3_ with
respect to proceedings to enforce rights under this _Article VI_ , the
Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a
proceeding, or part thereof, initiated by such indemnitee (including claims
and counterclaims, whether such counterclaims are asserted by (i) such
indemnitee, or (ii) the Corporation in a proceeding initiated by such
indemnitee) only if such proceeding, or part thereof, was authorized or
ratified by the Board of Directors.

 

(b) To receive indemnification under this _Section 6.1_, an indemnitee shall
submit a written request to the Corporation. Such request shall include
documentation or information that is necessary to determine the entitlement of
the indemnitee to indemnification and that is reasonably available to the
indemnitee. Upon receipt by the Corporation of such a written request,
the entitlement of the indemnitee to indemnification shall be determined by
the following person or persons who shall be empowered to make such
determination: (i) the Board of Directors by a majority vote of the directors
who are not parties to such proceeding, whether or not such majority
constitutes a quorum, (ii) a committee of such directors designated by a
majority vote of such directors, whether or not such majority constitutes a
quorum, (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct,
by independent legal counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a
copy of which shall be delivered to the indemnitee, (iv) the stockholders of
the Corporation or (v) in the event that a change of control (as defined
below) has occurred, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion to the
Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the indemnitee. The
determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be made and, unless a
contrary determination is made, such indemnification shall be paid in full by
the Corporation not later than 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of a
written request for indemnification. For purposes of this  _Section 6.1(b)_,
a " _change of control_ " will be deemed to have occurred if the individuals
who, as of the effective date of these Bylaws, constitute the Board of
Directors (the " _incumbent board_ ") cease for any reason to constitute at
least a majority of the Board of Directors; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
individual becoming a director subsequent to such effective date whose
election, or nomination for election by the stockholders of the Corporation,
was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising
the incumbent board shall be considered as though such individual were a
member of the incumbent board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such
individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual
or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of
directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by
or on behalf of a person other than the Board of Directors.

 



12 Section 6.2 _Right to Advancement of Expenses_.

 

(a) In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in _Section 6.1_,
an indemnitee shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, also have
the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred in defending any proceeding with respect to which
indemnification is required under _Section 6.1_ in advance of its final
disposition (hereinafter an " _advancement of expenses_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that an advancement of expenses shall be made only upon delivery
to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an " _undertaking_ "), by
or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined by final judicial decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "
_final adjudication_ ") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
for such expenses under this _Article VI_ or otherwise.

 

(b) To receive an advancement of expenses under this _Section 6.2_, an
indemnitee shall submit a written request to the Corporation. Such request
shall reasonably evidence the expenses incurred by the indemnitee and shall
include or be accompanied by the undertaking required by _Section 6.2(a)_.
Each such advancement of expenses shall be made within 20 days after
the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for advancement of
expenses.

Section 6.3 _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. In the event that a
determination is made that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification
or if payment is not timely made following a determination of entitlement to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)_ or if an advancement of
expenses is not timely made under _Section 6.2(b)_, the indemnitee may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation in a court of competent
jurisdiction in the State of Delaware seeking an adjudication of entitlement
to such indemnification or advancement of expenses. If successful in whole or
in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover
an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or
defending such suit to the fullest extent permitted by law. In any suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but
not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement
of expenses) it shall be a defense that the indemnitee has not met any
applicable standard of conduct for indemnification set forth in the DGCL.
Further, in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be
entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the
indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of conduct for indemnification
set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its
directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee
is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a
committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders)
that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall
create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct or, in the case of such a

 



13  suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an
advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover
an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden
of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such
advancement of expenses, under applicable law, this  _Article VI_ or
otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

Section 6.4 _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification and to
the advancement of expenses conferred in this _Article VI_ shall not be
exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under any law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors,
provisions of a certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or otherwise.

Section 6.5 _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

 

Section 6.6 _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation_. The
Corporation may, to the extent and in the manner permitted by applicable law,
and to the extent authorized from time to time, grant rights to
indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of
the Corporation.

 

Section 6.7 _Nature of Rights_. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this
_Article VI_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to
an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or trustee and shall
inure to the benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators.
Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this  _Article VI_ that adversely
affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only
and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding
involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to
act that took place prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal.

Section 6.8 _Settlement of Claims_. Notwithstanding anything in this _Article
VI_ to the contrary, the Corporation shall not be liable to indemnify any
indemnitee under this _Article VI_ for any amounts paid in settlement of any
proceeding effected without the Corporations written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, or for any judicial award if the
Corporation was not given a reasonable and timely opportunity, at its expense,
to participate in the defense of such proceeding. 

Section 6.9 _Subrogation_. In the event of payment under this _Article VI_,
the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of
the rights of recovery of the indemnitee, who shall execute all papers
required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights,
including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Corporation
effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

 



14 Section 6.10 _Severability_. If any provision or provisions of this  _Article
VI_ shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever, (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this _Article VI_ (including, without limitation, all portions
of any paragraph of this _Article VI_ containing any such provision held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not by themselves invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby, and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this
_Article VI_ (including, without limitation, all portions of any paragraph of
this _Article VI_ containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable)
shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent of the parties that the
Corporation provide protection to the indemnitee to the fullest enforceable
extent.

 

ARTICLE VII

CAPITAL STOCK

Section 7.1 _Certificates for Stock_. The Board of Directors shall determine
whether shares of the corporation shall be uncertificated or certificated.
Every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a
certificate signed by or in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman or
Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, if any, or the President or a Vice
President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary of
the Corporation or an Assistant Secretary, of the Corporation certifying the
number of shares owned by such holder in the Corporation. Any or all
such signatures may be facsimiles. In case any officer, transfer agent or
registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a
certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before
such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same
effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the
date of issue.

 

Section 7.2 _Transfers of Stock_. Transfers of shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be made only on the books of the Corporation upon
authorization by the registered holder thereof or by such holders attorney
thereunto authorized by a power of attorney duly executed and filed with the
Secretary of the Corporation or a transfer agent for such stock, and if such
shares are represented by a certificate, upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates for such shares properly endorsed or accompanied by a duly
executed stock transfer power and the payment of any taxes thereon; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Corporation shall be entitled to recognize and enforce
any lawful restriction on transfer.

Section 7.3 _Lost Certificates_. The Corporation may issue a new share
certificate or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate
theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and
the Corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate or the owners legal representative to give the Corporation a bond
(or other adequate security) sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that
may be made against it (including any expense or liability) on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of
such new certificate or uncertificated shares. The Board of Directors may
adopt such other provisions and restrictions with reference to lost
certificates, not inconsistent with applicable law, as it shall in its
discretion deem appropriate.

 



15 Section 7.4 _Registered Stockholders_. The Corporation shall be entitled to
recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the
owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and shall not
be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such
share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have
express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise required by law.

Section 7.5  _Record Date for Determining Stockholders_. In order that the
Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of, or to vote
at, any meeting of stockholders or any adjourned meeting, or to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or to demand a
special meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record
date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record
date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall,
unless otherwise required by law, not be more than 60 days before the date of
such meeting. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of
or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjourned meeting
unless the board fixes a new record date, which it must do if the meeting is
adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original
meeting.

 

Section 7.6 _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever notice is required to be given under
any provision of the DGCL or the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver
by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to
notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the stockholders, the Board of Directors or a
committee of the Board of Directors need be specified in any written waiver
of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.
