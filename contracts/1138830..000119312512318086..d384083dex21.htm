Corporation_.

 

(a) The certificate of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately

ARTICLE III

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

SECTION 3.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one (1)
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the

 



13  Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing shares of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(b) _Treasury Stock, Parent-Owned Stock and Subsidiary-Owned Stock_. Any
shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury
stock, and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or
any Subsidiary of the Company, shall be automatically cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than shares treated in accordance with _Section
3.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive
$8.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of (i) a certificate, which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") and (ii) a share of Company Common Stock held in book-entry
form (a " _Book-Entry Share_ "), shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share,
as the case may be, in accordance with _Section 3.2(b)_, without interest.

 

SECTION 3.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the
" _Paying Agent_ ") to receive, for the benefit of holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, the aggregate Merger Consideration (the " _Aggregate
Merger Consideration_ ") to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock
shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_. Parent shall deposit the
Aggregate Merger Consideration in cash with the Paying Agent promptly after
the Effective Time. The Aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the
Paying Agent shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, such
amounts on deposit with the Paying Agent shall not be used for any purpose
other than to fund payments due pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ or _Section
3.6_. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such
amounts on deposit with the Paying Agent will be payable to Parent or as
Parent otherwise directs. Parent shall provide additional funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in the
amount of any net loss resulting from the investment of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration at the time of and to the extent necessary for payment of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration.

 



14 (b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a Certificate or Certificates (and each holder of Book-Entry Shares) whose
shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to
the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other
provisions (including customary representations and warranties of the
applicable holder and customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agents message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares) as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation or surrender of
Book-Entry Shares, in each case, to the Paying Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration, without interest, for each Book-Entry Share or share of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates, and the
Certificates so surrendered, if applicable, shall forthwith be cancelled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (i) in the case of a
Certificate, the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) in the case of both a
Certificate or a Book-Entry Share, the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 3.2_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article III_ , without
interest.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common
Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid in exchange for shares of Company
Common Stock upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Book-Entry Shares
or shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates,
and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented thereby, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of  _Section
3.2(e)_, if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_. 

 



15 (d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article III_.

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following one (1) year after the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement,
without any interest thereon.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.

SECTION 3.3. _Company Stock Options_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Stock Options_.

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to provide that each option that represents the right to acquire shares of
Company Common Stock (each, an " _Option_ ") that is outstanding and vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and terminated and
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal
to the Option Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then
subject to the Option. Except as otherwise provided below, the Option
Consideration shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the
Closing Date except where delay is due to restrictions under applicable Law.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price payable in respect of a
share of Company Common Stock under an Option that is outstanding and
vested immediately prior to the Effective Time exceeds the Merger
Consideration, such Option shall be cancelled for no consideration at the
Effective Time and the holder of such Option shall have no further rights with
respect thereto.

 



16 (ii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to provide that each Option that is outstanding and unvested immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a Continuing Employee or a Continuing
Contractor/Consultant shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of such Option, be assumed by
Parent and converted into a stock option that represents the right to acquire
a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common
stock of Parent, no par value (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), equal to the
product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Option, multiplied by (B) the Conversion Ratio (each, a " _Converted Option_
");  _provided_ , _however_ , that any fractional share resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. Following the
Effective Time, each Converted Option shall continue to be governed by the
same material terms and conditions, including the vesting schedule, as were
applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time to the Option from which it
was converted, including terms contained in the Company Stock Plans and any
option award agreement, in all cases subject to restrictions related to the
issuance of shares under applicable Law. The exercise price of each Converted
Option shall be equal to (A) the exercise price of the Option from which it
was converted, divided by (B) the Conversion Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent. As used in this Agreement, " _Conversion Ratio_ " means a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Merger Consideration and the
denominator of which shall be the average closing price for a share of Parent
Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on and including
the trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time as reported by the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. through the NASDAQ Global
Market Reporting System for the Closing Date.

(b) _Additional Actions_.

 

(i) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Company will not at the Effective Time be bound
by any options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, warrants or
other rights or agreements which would entitle any Person, other than Parent
and its Subsidiaries, to own any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
or to receive any payment in respect thereof. The adjustments provided for in
_Section 3.3(a)(ii)_ shall be and are intended to be effected in a manner
that is consistent with Section 409A and Section 424 of the Code, to the
extent applicable.

(ii) On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions
necessary to (A) ensure that at the Effective Time Parent shall assume the
Converted Options in accordance with the terms set forth in this _Section
3.3_ and shall assume the Company Stock Plans to the extent necessary to
maintain the Converted Options, and (B) reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the
Converted Options. With respect to the Converted Options, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC 

 



17  a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form), relating to
the Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of Converted Options
by the Registration Deadline. Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, subject to applicable securities Laws, to maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement for so long as any Converted Options remain
outstanding. Parent shall, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date,
deliver to each holder of a Converted Option written notice documenting the
assumption of the Converted Options. Such notice shall specify the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Converted Option, as well as the
exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock subject to the Converted
Options. For the purposes hereof, " _Registration Deadline_ " means the
Business Day following the first regularly scheduled monthly review of
proposed equity awards by the compensation committee of the board of
directors of Parent immediately after the Effective Time.

SECTION 3.4.  _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article
III_ to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in
_Section 6.2_), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction. 

SECTION 3.5. _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation and any Subsidiary of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this  _Article III_
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of the Code or any other provision
of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law or other applicable
legal requirement or as may be permitted to be deducted or withheld therefrom
pursuant to any agreement between the Person to whom such amount is to be paid
and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also be entitled to deduct and
withhold by any reasonable means such amounts as may be required or permitted
to be deducted or withheld with respect to any benefit arising pursuant to
this Agreement. If the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds any amounts described
in this Section 3.5, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

SECTION 3.6. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder
who did not vote in favor of the Merger and who is entitled to demand and
properly demands

 



18  appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "),
shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder
shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such Dissenting Stockholder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such
Dissenting Stockholders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the
right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each
such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with _Section
3.1(c)_, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
(i) waive any failure by a stockholder to timely comply with the requirements
of Section 262 of the DGCL to perfect or demand appraisal of such holders
shares of Company Common Stock or (ii) voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for
payment. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying
Agent pursuant to _Section 3.2_ to pay for shares of Company Common Stock
for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent
upon demand.

(a) The Company has filed and furnished all required reports, schedules,

4.8(b)_, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). None of the Subsidiaries of the
Company is required to file or furnish any report, schedule, form,

SEC. As of their respective effective dates, in the case of Company
SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the

dates, in the case of all other Company SEC Documents (or, if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof, on the date of such filing),
the Company SEC Documents complied as to form, and each such Company SEC
Document filed subsequent to the date hereof and prior to the consummation of
the Merger will comply as to form, in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, applicable to
such Company SEC Documents and to the extent in effect at the time of filing,
and none of the Company SEC Documents as of such respective dates,

 



24  nor any other communication disseminated by the Company to its
securityholders since January 1, 2009 as of their respective dissemination
dates, contained, and no such Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the
date hereof and prior to the consummation of the Merger will contain, any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

(b) The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete
copies of all comment letters received by the Company from the SEC since
January 1, 2009 relating to the Company SEC Documents, together with all

submitted by the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as required, pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, at the time of
filing or submission of each such certification, such certification was true
and accurate and complied with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. None of the Company,
any current executive officer of the Company or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any former executive officer of the Company has received written or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, oral notice from any Governmental Authority
challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of

completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 30, 2011,
and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances that would
prevent its chief executive officer and chief financial officer from giving
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due.

SECTION 4.9. _Financial Statements; Internal Controls; No Undisclosed
Liabilities_. 

(a) The consolidated financial statements of the Company (including, in each
case, any notes and schedules thereto) included in the Company SEC Documents
comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto at the date of the filing of such Company SEC Documents, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited quarterly
statements, as indicated in the notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in 

 



25  the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to the absence of complete footnote disclosure
and normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which has been or will
be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

(b) The Company has established and maintains a system of internal control
over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act), and such system is
sufficient in all material respects to provide reasonable assurance (i) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures are
executed in accordance with the authorization of management, and (iii) that
any unauthorized use, acquisition or disposition of the Companys assets that
would materially affect the Companys financial statements would be detected
or prevented in a timely manner.

 

(c) The Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that material information (both financial and non-financial) relating
to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure, and such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms.

 

(d) The Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the
Companys auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of the
Company (i) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for
the Companys auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (ii)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls.
Since January 1, 2009, neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of
their respective directors or officers nor, to the Knowledge of the Company,
any of their respective employees, auditors or accountants has received or
otherwise had or obtained Knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding any failure of or deficiency in the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices.

 



26 (e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, determined,
determinable or otherwise, and whether known or unknown) whether or not
required, if known, to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes
thereto, except liabilities (i) as and to the extent reflected or reserved
against on the balance sheet (the " _Company Balance Sheet_ ") of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of March 30, 2012 (the " _Balance Sheet Date_ ")
(including the notes thereto) included in the Company SEC Documents filed by
the Company and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Filed Company SEC Documents_ "), (ii) incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions, (iii) incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or (iv) incurred
after the Balance Sheet Date that, individually or in the aggregate, are not
and would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act)), where the result, purpose
or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in the Companys or such Subsidiarys published financial statements or any
Company SEC Documents.

Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of

obligations under any Company Plan, or (v) create any limitation or

conducted or as currently proposed to be conducted, each of the
structures, equipment and other tangible assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries utilized in their operations is in good and usable condition,

connection with the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and which is
necessary for the continued operation of the business as the business is
currently conducted and as currently proposed to be conducted. Except as would
not materially affect the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken

exclusive license grant), (ii) any use, practice or other exploitation of any
Company Intellectual Property or Company Technology by the Company or any of

the Company, any other use, practice or other exploitation of any Company
Intellectual Property or Company Technology by such licensee, customer or end-

into a source code escrow Contract or other Contract) requiring the deposit of
any source code or related source materials for any Company Software.

43  any other code designed or intended to have, or capable of performing or
that without user intent will cause, any of the following functions: (i)

Patent included in the Registered Intellectual Property have been made with
respect to any standard promulgated by any Standards Organization) and (iv)
to the Knowledge of the Company, no Patent included in the Registered
Intellectual Property is essential to any Standards Organization or any
standard promulgated by any Standards Organization. _Schedule 4.21(l)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Standards Organizations in which the
Company or its Subsidiaries participates.

(m) No Governmental Authority, university, college, other educational
institution or research center has any claim, ownership right or other right

request from any Person for indemnification with respect to any claim of
infringement, misappropriation, misuse, dilution or violation of any

(o) The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not result
in the loss or impairment of any right of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to own, use, practice or otherwise exploit any material Company
Intellectual Property or Company Technology. Neither this Agreement nor any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement will result in the grant by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person of any ownership interest
or Intellectual Property License with respect to any material Company
Intellectual Property or Company Technology or any Intellectual Property or
Technology owned by Parent or any of its Affiliates pursuant to any Contract
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any
assets or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound.

(p) The Company has provided sufficient disclosure with respect to its
privacy policies and related practices, including providing any type of notice
and obtaining any type of consent required by applicable Law. Such disclosures
have not contained any material omissions of the Companys privacy policies
and related practices. The Companys privacy policies and related practices
are, in all material respects, consistent with standards that are customary in
the industry. The Company has not collected, used or shared and does not
collect, use or share personally identifiable information (including name,

respect to natural persons (" _NPI_ "). The Company and its Subsidiaries have
(i) complied in all material respects with the Companys privacy policies and

no claims have been asserted or threatened, or reasonably expected to be
asserted or threatened, with respect to NPI possessed by or otherwise subject
to the control of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the term "privacy"

and data security.

respects (including with respect to working condition and capacity) for the

modification, of any of the Policies. No written or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, oral notice of cancellation or termination has been received by the
Company with respect to any of the Policies. The consummation of the
Transactions will not, in and of itself, cause the revocation, cancellation
or termination of any Policy.

from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company
shall file with the SEC the definitive Proxy Statement, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement
to the stockholders of the Company, as promptly as reasonably practicable
after it receives notice from the SEC that it will not receive comments, and
(ii) if the Company does receive comments from the SEC with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company shall file with the SEC the

and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to responding to any such comments or
requests or the filing or mailing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto), the Company shall (i) provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such document or response,
(ii) include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by

Time, any event or information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates should be discovered by Parent or the Company which
should be set forth in an amendment or

 



56  supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such document would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and

information to be filed with the SEC as promptly as practicable thereafter
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, cause such amendment or
supplement to be distributed to the stockholders of the Company.

reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement) for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders, which

no later than the fortieth (40th) calendar day (or, if such calendar day is

immediately following the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement (the "
_Company Stockholders Meeting_ "), solely for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval and the approval of other matters related to the
Transactions, regardless of whether the board of directors of the Company
determines at any time that this Agreement is no longer advisable or
recommends that the stockholders of the Company reject it or any other
Company Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred at any time. The Company
shall consult with Parent regarding the date of the Company Stockholders
Meeting and shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting
without the prior written consent of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that

quorum at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Company uses
its reasonable best efforts during any such postponement or adjournment to
obtain such a quorum as soon as practicable or (ii) the Company is required to
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting by applicable Law or
Order or a request from the SEC to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys stockholders and
the Company uses its reasonable best efforts to hold or resume the Company
Stockholders Meeting as soon as practicable.

(d) The Company shall comply in all material respects with all Laws applicable
to the Company Stockholders Meeting. Unless the board of directors of the
Company shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in

directors of the Company shall unanimously recommend to the stockholders of
the Company adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Board Recommendation_
"), (ii) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval, (iii) the Proxy Statement shall include a copy
of the Fairness Opinion and the Company Board Recommendation and (iv) the

modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation.
Without limiting the generality of

 



57  the foregoing, the Company agrees that, subject to _Section 6.4(e)_ and
_Section 8.1(d)_, (i) the Companys obligations pursuant to _Section 6.3(c)_
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to the Company of any Takeover Proposal and (ii) the Company
shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting and the matters constituting the Company
Stockholder Approval shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at
the Company Stockholders Meeting regardless of whether (A) a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change shall have occurred or (B) any Takeover Proposal or
Superior Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or announced or otherwise
submitted to the Company or any of its Representatives. The Company agrees
that it shall not submit to the vote of the stockholders of the Company any
Takeover Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) prior to the vote of
the stockholders of the Company with respect to the Merger at the Company
Stockholders Meeting. The notice of such Company Stockholders Meeting shall
state that a resolution to adopt this Agreement and a resolution to adjourn
the Company Stockholders Meeting will be considered at the Company
Stockholders Meeting, and no other matters shall be considered or voted upon
at the Company Stockholders Meeting without Parents prior written consent.

SECTION 6.4. _No Solicitation by the Company_. 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the Companys and
its Subsidiaries respective directors, officers, employees, investment
bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, agents and other
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and use reasonable
best efforts to obtain the return from all such Persons or cause the
destruction (with confirmation of destruction) of all copies of confidential
information previously provided to such parties by or on behalf of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their Representatives. Subject to the terms of
_Section 6.4(b)_, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit,
initiate, cause or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing information) the submission of any Takeover Proposal or the making
of any offer, inquiry or proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, disclose any non-public information relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to or otherwise cooperate in any way, or knowingly assist, participate in,
facilitate or encourage any effort by, any third party regarding any Takeover
Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term
sheet, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract (other than a
confidentiality agreement contemplated by and in accordance with Section
6.4(b)(i)) related to any Takeover Proposal or enter into any agreement or
agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the Transactions or breach its obligations hereunder or (iv)
resolve to do any of the foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, it is
understood that any violation of the

 



58  restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.4_ by any Subsidiary of the
Company or Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
deemed to be a breach of this  _Section 6.4_ by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of _Section 6.4(a)_ or anything
else to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if the board of directors of
the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal made
after the date hereof in circumstances not involving a breach of this
Agreement, and the board of directors of the Company reasonably determines in
good faith, after consulting with and receiving the advice of outside counsel
and a financial advisor of national reputation, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and that
the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
Delaware Law, then the Company may, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval) and after providing Parent prior written notice of its
intention to take such actions (provided that the Company shall only be
required to provide the notice required by this sentence to Parent on one (1)
occasion with respect to any particular Person) (i) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making
such Takeover Proposal, but only after such Person enters into a customary
confidentiality agreement with the Company (which confidentiality agreement
must be no less favorable to the Company (i.e., no less restrictive with
respect to the conduct of such Person) than the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such confidentiality agreement need not restrict
the making of Takeover Proposals to the Company, the Companys board of
directors or any committee thereof), provided that (A) such confidentiality
agreement may not include any provision calling for an exclusive right to
negotiate with the Company and may not restrict the Company from complying
with this _Section 6.4_ and (B) the Company advises Parent of all such non-
public information delivered, or otherwise made available, to such Person
substantially concurrently with its delivery to such Person and substantially
concurrently with its delivery to such Person the Company makes available to
Parent all such information not previously made available to Parent, and (ii)
participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person regarding such
Takeover Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with a true, correct and
complete copy of any confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this
_Section 6.4(b)_ within twenty-four (24) hours of the execution thereof.

 

(c) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 6.4_, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in
writing, and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt, if
any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is received by, any information
is requested from, any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
or continued with or any access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records is requested from, the Company (or any of its Representatives) in
respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent,
indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or
other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or offers or the
nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with such notice copies
of any written materials and electronic communications received from or on
behalf of such Person relating to such

 



59  proposal, offer, inquiry or request (including the financing thereof)), and
thereafter shall promptly keep Parent reasonably informed of all material
developments affecting the status and terms of any such proposals, offers,
inquiries or requests (and the Company shall provide Parent with copies of any
additional written materials and electronic communications received from such
third party by the Company or any of its Representatives or provided to such
third party by the Company or any of its Representatives that relate to such
proposals, offers, inquiries or requests, including any amendments or proposed
amendments as to price and other terms of any such proposal, offer,
inquiry or request) and of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations. The Company shall provide Parent with at least forty-eight (48)
hours prior notice (or any lesser period of advance notice provided to the
members of the board of directors of the Company generally) of any meeting of
the board of directors of the Company at which the board of directors of the
Company is reasonably expected to consider any Takeover Proposal.

 

(d) The board of directors of the Company shall not (i) withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation or the approval or declaration of advisability by
the board of directors of the Company of this Agreement and the Transactions
(including the Merger), (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal, (iii) make
any public statement inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation or
(iv) resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (any
action described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to
as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the board of
directors of the Company, following receipt of and on account of a Superior
Proposal, may (i) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, or (ii)
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal in accordance with the terms of  _Section 8.1(d)(i)_,
but only if, in either case, the board of directors of the Company reasonably
determines in good faith, after consulting with and receiving the advice of
outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the board of directors of the Company shall not make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms
of  _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, unless (A) the Company promptly notifies Parent
(the " _Company Adverse Recommendation Notice_ ") in writing at least four (4)
Business Days before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminating this Agreement (the " _Notice Period_ ") of its intention to take
such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, (B) the Company attaches to
such notice the most current version of the proposed agreement (which version
shall be updated on a prompt basis) and the identity of the third party making
the Superior Proposal, (C) to the extent Parent desires, the Company has
negotiated and has caused its financial and legal advisors to, during the
Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior

 



60  Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments
(it being understood and agreed (1) that in the event that, after commencement
of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a
Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, the Notice Period shall
be extended, if applicable, to the extent necessary to ensure that at least
two (2) Business Days remains in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the
Company notifies Parent of any such material revision and (2) that there may
be multiple extensions of the Notice Period), and (D) Parent does not make,
within the Notice Period, a binding offer that is determined by the board of
directors of the Company in good faith, after consulting with and receiving
the advice of outside counsel and a financial advisor of national reputation,
to be at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such
Superior Proposal.

(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 6.4(e)_, the board of
directors of the Company may, in response to a material fact, event, change,
development or set of circumstances (other than an Takeover Proposal occurring
or arising after the date of this Agreement) that was not known to the board
of directors of the Company nor reasonably foreseeable by the board of
directors of the Company as of or prior to the date of this Agreement (and not
relating in any way to any Takeover Proposal) (such material fact, event,
change, development or set of circumstances, an " _Intervening Event_ "),
fail to make, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the Company Board Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that any such
action shall be deemed to be a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") if
the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consulting with and receiving the advice of outside counsel, that, in light of
such Intervening Event, the failure of the board of directors of the Company
to effect such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances shall constitute
an Intervening Event if such fact, event, change, development or set of
circumstances resulted from or arose out of the announcement, pendency or
consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the
board of directors of the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right
to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section
6.4(f) unless the board of directors of the Company has (i) delivered to
Parent a Company Adverse Recommendation Notice at least four (4) Business
Days prior to making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change advising Parent
that the board of directors of the Company intends to take such action and
specifying the facts underlying the board of directors determination that an
Intervening Event has occurred, and the reasons for the Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail, and (ii) during the Notice
Period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of the Intervening Event.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the board of directors
of the Company from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act with regard to a Takeover Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication
or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to 

 



61  be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the board of directors of
the Company expressly publicly reaffirms its Company Board Recommendation (i)
in such communication or (ii) within ten (10) Business Days after being
requested to do so by Parent.

SECTION 6.5. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
6.5(d)_) and except as otherwise contemplated herein, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to
promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions,
including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect
all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any
required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), and (ii)
obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and
other confirmations from any Governmental Authority or third party necessary,
proper or advisable (including antitrust filings Parent determines in its
discretion to file voluntarily) to consummate the Transactions.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto
agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the date hereof
and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions
consistent with this _Section 6.5_ necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable. Parent shall not agree to extend any waiting period under any
Antitrust Laws or withdraw and refile any filing made pursuant to any
Antitrust Laws (or agree to do so) without the prior written consent of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. 

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing,
and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information and/or
the need to communicate on an outside-counsel-only basis, both Parent and
the Company shall (i) keep each other informed in all material respects and
on a reasonably timely basis regarding the progress and status of all filings
and submissions made with respect to the Transactions, (ii) provide each other
with copies of any written communications and full details of any oral
communications with the Federal Trade Commission ( the " _FTC_ "), the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the 

 



62  " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Authority, including any foreign
competition authority, (iii) give each other prior notice of any material
meeting and, to the extent practicable, any oral communication, with
representatives of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the
Transactions, including the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority,
including any foreign competition authority, (iv) give each other the
opportunity to consult in advance of, and consider in good faith the views of
the other party in connection with, any such meeting or communication with any
such Governmental Authority, (v) give each other the opportunity to attend or
participate (unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority) in any such
meeting or communication and (vi) to the extent practicable, provide notice of
any substantive communication to, and any proposed understanding, undertaking
or agreement with, any Governmental Authority with respect to any such filing
or submission or otherwise with respect to the Transactions. Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of the parties
hereto shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to
the other parties and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 6.5_, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond to any request for additional information
or documentary material received from any Governmental Authority under the
HSR Act or Foreign Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable and to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted by a Governmental Authority or
other Person with respect to the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not, without
Parents prior written consent, commit to any divestiture transaction, hold
separate, license or similar arrangements or any material actions,
undertakings or arrangements or agree to any restriction on its business, and
nothing in this _Section 6.5_ shall limit any applicable rights a party may
have to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1_ so long as such
party has up to then complied in all material respects with its obligations
under this _Section 6.5_. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to (i) offer, accept or agree to (A)
dispose, hold separate, license or similar arrangements or any material
actions, undertakings or arrangements relating to any part of its or the
Companys businesses, operations, assets or product lines (or a combination of
Parents and the Companys respective businesses, operations, assets or
product lines), (B) not compete in any geographic area or line of business,
and/or (C) restrict the manner in which, or whether, Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates may carry on business in any
part of the world, or (ii) defend, contest or otherwise resist any Legal
Proceeding, whether administrative or judicial and whether involving a
Governmental Authority or other Person, challenging this Agreement or any of
the Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law, including seeking to have
vacated or reversed any Order by any Governmental Authority that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in
no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries take or agree to take
any actions contemplated by the foregoing sentence without the prior written
consent of Parent, and

 



63  (ii) nothing in this _Section 6.5_ shall require the Company or its
Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business
or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is
conditioned upon Closing.

SECTION 6.6. _Public Announcements_. The Current Report on Form 8-K to be
filed by the Company on the date hereof to report the Transactions shall be in
a form mutually acceptable to the Company and Parent. The Company shall not,
and shall cause its Representatives not to, issue or cause publication of
any press release or other public announcement (including any filing with the
SEC) or make any other public statement (including answering questions from
reporters or analysts) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other
Transactions without the prior consent of Parent, except (a) as may be
required by applicable Law or the Nasdaq Stock Market as determined in the
reasonable judgment of the Company (in which case the Company shall not issue
or cause the publication of such release or other public announcement without
prior consultation with Parent), or (b) with respect to any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 6.7. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Parents directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants, agents and other representatives (collectively, " _Parent s
Representatives_") reasonable access during normal business hours to all of
the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts, commitments,
records and correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic
form), officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives, and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy
of each report, schedule and other document (other than the Proxy Statement
and any amendment thereto) filed or submitted by it pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities Laws (and the Company shall
deliver to Parent a copy of each report, schedule and other document proposed
to be filed or submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of
federal securities Laws not less than three (3) Business Days prior to such
filing) and a copy of any communication (including "comment letters") received
by the Company from the SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and
(b) all other information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Except for
disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement for
Possible Transaction, dated as of May 11, 2012, between Parent and the Company
(as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
all information received from the Company pursuant to this _Section 6.7_
shall be held by the receiving party in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation by Parent or Parents
Representatives, or information received by or made available to Parent or
Parents Representatives, in each case, pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ shall
limit, modify or otherwise affect any of the representations and warranties
(or remedies with respect thereto) of the parties hereto.

 

SECTION 6.8. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any

 



64  notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, (b) any Legal Proceeding commenced or, to such partys
Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
such party or any of its Subsidiaries that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed on the Company
Disclosure Schedule or which relate to the Transactions or (c) the discovery
of any (i) fact or circumstance, (ii) occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event, (iii) inaccuracy of any representation or warranty or (iv) breach of
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that is reasonably likely to
cause the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ not to be satisfied; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 6.8_ shall not (A) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any
other provision of this Agreement or (B) limit, modify or otherwise affect
the remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

SECTION 6.9. _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation (or any of its successors or assigns) to fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to indemnify,
hold harmless, advance expenses and exculpate from liabilities for acts or
omissions each person who at or prior to the Effective Time were directors or
officers of the Company (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") (A) as required
by the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement
and (B) pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date hereof, true,
correct and complete copies of which have been made available to Parent and
are listed on _Section 6.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Parents
obligation under this _Section 6.9(a)_ shall survive the Merger and remain
in full force and effect for a period of not less than six (6) years after the
Effective Time.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain (and pay the
premium in full in cash for) insurance coverage for its directors and officers
who are covered by the directors and officers liability insurance policy
maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (a true,
correct and complete copy of which has heretofore been made available to
Parent) in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth on _Schedule
6.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(c) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.9_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this  _Section 6.9_. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her heirs.
The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation (and its successors
and assigns) under this  _Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee without the consent of such
affected Indemnitee.

 

SECTION 6.10. _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement
or the Transactions

 



65  (" _Securityholder Litigation_ "), and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent (which consent may be granted or
withheld in Parents sole discretion, but will not be unreasonably delayed).
At the Companys request, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide assistance to the Company in the defense of any Securityholder
Litigation. Subject to  _Section 7.1(c)_, the pendency of any Securityholder
Litigation shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of their respective
obligations set forth in the Agreement.

 

SECTION 6.11. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section 8.3_, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 

SECTION 6.12. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action
Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters.

SECTION 6.13. _State Takeover Laws_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take all action necessary to ensure that no State Takeover Law or
similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the Transactions. If any State
Takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger or the other
Transactions, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective boards of directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise minimize the effect of such State Takeover Law on the Transactions.

SECTION 6.14. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do,
in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

SECTION 6.15. _Resignation of Directors_. The Company shall cause each of the
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent
requested by Parent no less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, to submit a letter of resignation or otherwise be removed effective on
or before the Closing Date.

 



66 SECTION 6.16. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that each employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company who is employed immediately prior to the Effective Time and continues
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") shall, as of the Effective Time, receive full credit
for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and
severance benefits for service with the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time under the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and
policies of Parent or the Surviving Corporation in which such Continuing
Employee becomes a participant (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to any equity awards or incentives granted after the Effective Time);
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing herein shall result in the duplication
of any benefits for the same period of service.

(b) With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation for the benefit of Continuing Employees, Parent
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that its third party
insurance carriers (i) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods,
any evidence of insurability requirements and the application of any pre-
existing condition limitations under such plan to the extent such were waived
or satisfied under the comparable health or welfare benefit plan of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan for all
amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar Company Plan for
the plan year that includes the Effective Time for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plans maintained
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, for the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs.

(c) The parties will cooperate with respect to any employee communications
regarding any matters provided for herein. Parent will have the sole and
absolute discretion to approve of, in advance, any written or oral mass
employee communications or any other written employee communications relating
to any compensation or benefits to be provided by it or by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or after the Effective
Time. All other employee communications regarding the matters provided for
herein or relating to any compensation or benefits to be provided by Parent or
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or
after the Effective Time made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
be consistent with the terms, conditions and parameters to be mutually agreed
upon by Parent and the Company.

(d) Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries will terminate any and all Company Plans intended to qualify as a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code ("
_Company DC Plans_ "), and effective immediately prior to the Effective Time
no Continuing Employee shall have any right thereafter to contribute any
amounts to any Company DC Plan. At the request of Parent, the Company will
provide Parent with evidence that each such Company DC Plan has been
terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time

 



67  pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by the board of directors of the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, take all actions necessary to complete the
termination of each Company DC Plan, including the filing of a Form 5310 with
the IRS, and upon receipt of a favorable determination of such filing
from the IRS, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide each Continuing Employee (or any beneficiary thereof) with the option
to receive a complete distribution of his or her account balance, in a form
elected by such individual, in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Company DC Plan and Section 401(k) of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.16_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section
6.16_ shall create such rights in any such persons. Nothing herein shall (i)
guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any Continuing
Employee at any time and for any reason, (ii) require Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to continue any Company Plans, or other employee benefit plans or
arrangements or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Effective Time, or (iii) amend any Company Plans or other employee
benefit plans or arrangements.

 

SECTION 6.17. _Intellectual Property Covenants_. The Company will, prior to
the Effective Time, take all actions set forth on  _Schedule 6.17_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to Intellectual Property and
Technology.

threatened any Legal Proceeding initiated by the DOJ or FTC under any
Antitrust Law, (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal, delay materially or
otherwise directly or indirectly restrain or prohibit the consummation of the
Merger or seeking to obtain material damages in connection therewith, (ii)
seeking to restrain or prohibit as a result of

 



69  the Merger Parents ownership or operation (or that of its Affiliates) of
all or any material portion of the business, assets or products of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of Parent and its Affiliates,
taken as a whole, or to compel Parent or any of its Affiliates to dispose of,
license (whether pursuant to an exclusive or nonexclusive license) or hold
separate all or any material portion of the business, assets or products of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of Parent and its
Affiliates, taken as a whole, (iii) seeking, directly or indirectly, to impose
or confirm material limitations on the ability of Parent or any of
its Affiliates effectively to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of
ownership of Company Common Stock or any shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation, including the right to vote such shares on all matters
properly presented to the stockholders of the Company, or (iv) seeking to
require divestiture by Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents other Affiliates
of any equity interests.

(f) _No Orders_. There shall not be in effect any Order that is reasonably
likely to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the effects referred to in
clauses (i) through (iv) of  _Section 7.2(e)_.

SECTION 7.3. _Conditions to Obligation of the Company_. The obligation of the
Company to effect the Merger is further subject to the satisfaction (or
waiver, if permissible under applicable Law) at or prior to the Effective Time
of the following conditions:

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement disregarding all
qualifications and exceptions contained therein related to materiality or
Parent Material Adverse Effect, shall be true and correct as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing
Date (or, if given as of a specific date, at and as of such date),
except where the failure to be so true and correct would not have or would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent and Merger
Sub shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to
be performed by them under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date.

(c) _Certificate of Parent and Merger Sub_. The Company shall have received a
certificate signed on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub to evidence
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ and _Section
7.3(b)_.

SECTION 7.4. _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section
7.1_, _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied
if such failure was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any
of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



70 ARTICLE VIII

Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time
(notwithstanding any approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company):

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either of the Company or Parent, if:

(i) the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before January 26, 2013
(the " _Initial Walk-Away Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if (A) any
clearance decision under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law set forth on

Away Date shall be automatically extended until July 26, 2013 (the Initial
Walk-Away Date as may be extended, the " _Walk-Away Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to a party if the failure of the
Merger to have been consummated on or before the Walk-Away Date was primarily
due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement;

(ii) any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ shall be
in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if such Restraint was primarily
due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement; or

 

(iii) the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right of the Company

obligations under _Section 6.3_ or _Section 6.4_;

(c) by Parent, if:

 

(i) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred;

 

(ii) the Company shall have entered into, or publicly announced its intention

71 (iv) the board of directors of the Company (A) shall not have rejected any
Takeover Proposal within ten (10) Business Days of the making public thereof
(including, for these purposes, by taking no position with respect to the
acceptance by the stockholders of the Company of a tender offer or exchange
offer, which shall constitute a failure to reject such Takeover Proposal),
(B) shall have failed, pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act or otherwise, to publicly reconfirm the Company Board Recommendation
within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a written request from Parent
that it do so if such request is made following the public announcement by any
Person of a Takeover Proposal, (C) fails to include in the Proxy Statement the
Company Board Recommendation or (D) publicly announces its intention to do
any of the foregoing; or

(v) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A)
would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_
and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the Company within
thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of written notice from Parent of
such breach or failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have no
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.1(c)(v)_ if
there is an uncured material breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub
at the time of the breach by the Company or at the time of the purported
termination in connection therewith; or

 

(d) by the Company, if:

(i) prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, the board of directors of the
Company authorizes the Company, in compliance with the terms of this
Agreement, to enter into a binding definitive agreement in respect of a
Superior Proposal with a third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall have paid any amounts due pursuant to _Section 8.3_ in
accordance with the terms, and at the times, specified therein;  _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that in the event of such termination, the Company
concurrently enters into such binding definitive agreement; or

(ii) Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of Parent set forth
in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A) would
(if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or  _Section 7.3(b)_
and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Parent within thirty
(30) calendar days following receipt of written notice from the Company of
such breach or failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall have
no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ if
there is an uncured material breach of this Agreement by the Company at the
time of the breach by Parent or at the time of the purported termination in
connection therewith.

 



72 SECTION 8.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void (other than the provisions of _Section 4.29_, the penultimate
sentence of _Section 6.7_, _Section 6.11_, _Section 8.2_ and _Section
8.3_, _Article I_ and _Article IX_ , all of which shall survive termination
of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of the Company
or its Representatives and Affiliates or Parent, Merger Sub, Parents
Representatives or their respective Affiliates, except (a) the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, may have liability as provided in _Section 8.3_,
and (b) nothing shall relieve any party from liability for fraud or any
willful or intentional breach of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 8.3. _Termination Fees_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_, _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_, _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(iv)_ (or if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to any other provision of _Section 8.1_ at
any time after the occurrence of an event contemplated by any of _Section
8.1(c)(i)_, _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ or  _Section
8.1(c)(iv)_), then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds), within two (2) Business Days after such
termination, a fee in an amount equal to $10,950,000 (the "
_Company Termination Fee_ "). If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(i)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer
of immediately available funds), prior to and as a condition of such
termination, the Company Termination Fee.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_, 
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(v)_ and (i) prior to such
termination (in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or
_Section 8.1(c)(v)_) or the Company Stockholders Meeting (in the case of
termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_), a Takeover Proposal shall
have been publicly announced and not publicly withdrawn, and (ii) within
twelve (12) months following the date of such termination the Company shall
have (A) entered into a definitive agreement with respect to or (B)
consummated, a transaction contemplated by any Takeover Proposal, then the
Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds),
within two (2) Business Days after entering into such agreement or
consummating such transaction, the Company Termination Fee. For purposes of
clause (ii) of this _Section 8.3(b)_ only, all references to "twenty percent
(20%)" in the definition of "Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be
references to "fifty percent (50%)."

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company (i) (A)
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ and, at the time of such termination, the
conditions set forth in at least one of _Section 7.1(b), Section 7.1(c)_ (as
a result of a Restraint under the Antitrust Laws) or, solely in the case of
Parent, _Section 7.2(e)_ or _Section 7.2(f)_ shall not have been satisfied
or (B) pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ (as a result of a Restraint

 



73  under the Antitrust Laws), (ii) the failure of one or more of the conditions
in _Section 7.1(b), Section 7.1(c)_ (as a result of a Restraint under the
Antitrust Laws),  _Section 7.2(e)_ or _Section 7.2(f)_ to be satisfied is
not primarily caused by the failure of the Company to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement, and (iii) all other conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in
_Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, which
conditions would be satisfied if the Closing were to occur), then Parent
shall pay to the Company (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) a
fee in an amount equal to $20,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ")
within two (2) Business Days after such termination.

(d) In the event that the Company or Parent shall fail to pay the Company
Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, respectively, required
pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ when due, the Company Termination Fee and the
Parent Termination fee, as the case may be, shall accrue interest for the
period commencing on the date the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee, as the case may be, became past due, at a rate equal to the
rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, in the City of New York from
time to time during such period, as such banks Prime Lending Rate. In
addition, if the Company or Parent shall fail to pay the Company Termination
Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, respectively, when due, the defaulting
party shall pay to the other party all of its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect the Company
Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as the case may be. Each of the
Company and Parent acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee, the Parent
Termination Fee and the other provisions of this _Section 8.3_ are an
integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements, Parent
and the Company, as the case may be, would not enter into this Agreement.

 

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Termination Fee contemplated by
this _Section 8.3_ shall be payable by the Company on only one occasion,
whether or not the facts or circumstances giving rise to the Companys
obligation to pay the Termination Fee may otherwise trigger an obligation to
pay the Termination Fee under more than one subsection of this  _Section
8.3_ or on more than one occasion pursuant to the same subsection of this
_Section 8.3_. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Parent
Termination Fee contemplated by _Section 8.3(c)_ shall only be payable by
Parent on one occasion in accordance with _Section 8.3(c)_ and there are no
other facts or circumstances contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise which
would give rise to Parents obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee. The
Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that this _Section 8.3(e)_ shall not
be interpreted to limit or restrict Parents and the Companys, as the case
may be, ability to seek or obtain any other remedy it may have with respect
to this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION 9.1. _No Survival_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
the representations, warranties and agreements of each party hereto shall
remain

 



74  operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made
by or on behalf of any other party hereto, any Person controlling any such
party or any of their officers, directors or representatives, whether prior
to or after the execution of this Agreement, and no information delivered, or

provided in _Section 8.2_, upon the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_, as the case may be, except that the agreements
set forth in _Article III_ , _Section 6.9_ and _Section 6.11_ and any other
agreement in this Agreement which contemplates performance after
the Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time indefinitely and those

whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by
written agreement of the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that
following receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be no
amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law would require
further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such approval.

Time, any party hereto may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other party hereto with
any of the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided
herein, waive any of such partys conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

SECTION 9.4. _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of any other party hereto, except that
Parent or Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its
rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to one (1) or more of
their Affiliates, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub,
as applicable, of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this _Section
9.4_ shall be null and void.

 



75 SECTION 9.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one (1) and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto.

SECTION 9.6. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Voting Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof
and (b) except for the provisions of _Section 6.9_, are not intended to and
shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder. 

SECTION 9.7. _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process; Waiver of Jury Trial_. 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State.

(b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, and the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and,
in the case of appeals, appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The parties hereto
agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. Each party hereto hereby
consents to process being served in any such action or proceeding by the
mailing of a copy thereof to the address set forth in _Section 9.9_ and
agrees that such service upon receipt shall constitute good and sufficient
service of process or notice thereof. Nothing in this _Section 9.7_ shall
affect or eliminate any right to serve process in any other manner permitted
by Law.

 

(c) THE COMPANY AND PARENT EACH HEREBY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR
CAUSE OF ACTION (i) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (ii) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
WITH OR RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. THE COMPANY AND
PARENT EACH HEREBY AGREE AND CONSENT THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR
CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT ANY
PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF
THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 



76 SECTION 9.8. _Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or any federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware, without bond or other security being
required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity.

 

SECTION 9.9. _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) when
delivered or sent if delivered in person or sent by facsimile transmission
(provided confirmation of facsimile transmission is obtained), (b) on the

SECTION 9.10. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other
terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain

or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good

requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to
cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed
to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary
to take such action.
