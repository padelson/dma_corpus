caused by the Purchaser or of any of the Group Companies, including as a
result of a failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate any damages.

 



\- 34 -  ---|--- 

Promptly after the Purchaser shall have received notice (an "
_Indemnification Notice_ ") of the commencement of any action by any third
party in respect of which the Purchaser will or may seek indemnification under
this Section 6 (the " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Purchaser shall immediately
notify the Sellers thereof in writing pursuant to Section 7.1, but no failure
to so notify the Sellers shall relieve the Sellers from any liability that
they have to the Purchaser except if and to the extent that the Sellers shall
have been materially prejudiced thereby either because the damages have
increased or the notifying Party has failed to take reasonable steps to
mitigate the damages. In making any notice under this Section 7, the
Purchaser will specify with reasonable particularity the item or items giving
rise to the claim and the basis of the claim.

 

The Purchaser, in consultation with Sellers Representative and taking into
account the reasonable interests of the Sellers, shall be entitled to defend
lawsuits or actions (including, without limitation, all administrative
appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any tax authority and all
aspects of any litigation relating to taxes) and to employ and engage
attorneys of its own choice (with prior consultation with Sellers
Representative) to adequately handle and defend the same. The reasonable fees
of such attorneys shall be borne by the Sellers (to the extent such fees
cannot be recovered from the counterparty). In any event, the Purchaser may
not settle any such Third Party Claims without Sellers Representatives
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The Purchaser shall
keep the Sellers Representative informed of any proceedings relating to a
Third Party Claim.

The Sellers shall have the right to employ their own, separate counsel who may
give non-binding advice to the Purchaser and shall have the right to be
consulted by the Purchaser in the defense of such lawsuit or action, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Sellers.

 

The Sellers shall co-operate in all respects with the Purchaser and its
attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action
and any appeal arising therefrom.

Notwithstanding the above, the Sellers may, subject to the prior written
approval of the Purchaser, defend any claim themselves (or lead the defense
by the Purchaser of any claim) at their entire costs and the Purchaser shall
take any action and provide assistance required by the Sellers to enable the
Sellers to defend such claim.

 



   6.8 | Exclusive Remedy 
---|--- 

The sole and exclusive remedy of any Party for any misrepresentation
(excluding fraudulent or intentional misrepresentation) or any breach of a
warranty or covenant set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
a claim for indemnification under and pursuant to this Section 6 _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Purchaser shall be entitled to specific performance and
injunctive relief where available by applicable law. The remedies for breach
of representations and warranties shall be in lieu of, and not in addition
to, the remedies provided for by law. All other remedies including, without
limitation, the right to rescind this Agreement and to seek reduction of the
Purchase Price shall not apply and are expressly waived. In particular,
and without limitation to the foregoing, the Sellers and the Purchaser hereby
explicitly waive the right of contract rescission under articles 23 et seq.
and 205 CO.

 



\- 35 -  ---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers will,
jointly and severally, be responsible for, will pay, and will indemnify Swiss
Franc for Swiss Franc and hold harmless the Purchaser from and against any and
all liabilities, costs and expenses resulting from, arising out of, or
relating to Taxes of the Group Companies relating back to periods prior to the
Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnity under this Section 6.9
shall not include Taxes relating to the English Subsidiary which are dealt
with in the UK SPA.



   6.10 | [**] Claim Indemnity 
---|--- 

So long as the Company has duly performed its obligations contained in the
[**] Agreements, the Sellers will, severally and not jointly, be responsible
for and will pay to the Purchaser any [**] Claim which is owed and has been
paid by the Company pursuant to the terms of the [**] Agreements. The Sellers
shall have no liability for any [**] Claim unless and before the Company has
used its commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the fact or event which has
triggered such [**] Claim (if capable of being remedied), as the case may be
at the reasonable cost of the Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt, each Seller
shall only be liable under this Section 6.10 up to an amount which corresponds
to any [**] Claim multiplied by the percentage of Shares owned by him as set
out in Schedule A.

Until the Warranty End Date, the Sellers liability under this indemnification
provision shall not exceed a sum equal to CHF 18,658,500 (for the avoidance
of doubt, this amount shall be part of, and not in addition to, the Cap).
After the Warranty End Date, the Sellers liability under this indemnification
provision shall be reduced to CHF 567,372 through the Final Date, at which
point it will reduce to zero.

The indemnity under this Section 6.10 shall be subject to the other terms of
this Section 6, excluding the joint and several liability of the Sellers, the
Indemnification Periods and the Threshold, but including, for the avoidance of
doubt and without limitations, the Cap.

 

The Parties acknowledge that the indemnity given by the Sellers to the
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.10 (the "[**] _ Indemnity_ ") is based
on the assumption that Simon Kalfon, as the Managing Director, Financial
Messaging of the Company after Closing, will remain in charge and in control
of the [**] Project and that the Purchaser and/or its affiliates will, if so
reasonably requested by Simon Kalfon, assist the Company in duly performing
the [**] Project, including by providing technical and management assistance.

The Purchaser undertakes that from Closing until the Warranty End Date it will
not (and it will procure that the Company will not) change, remove, amend the
terms of employment of, or terminate any employee of the Company who is
directly involved in the [**] Project without the consent of Simon Kalfon,
which consent shall not be unreasonable withheld; provided, however, that
Simon Kalfon acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser will make certain
changes with respect to the Companys employment policies to make them
consistent with the Purchasers global employment policies, which in the
aggregate will not have a material impact on Companys ability to perform the
[**] Project. In the event that,

 



\- 36 -   despite such consent not having been given by Simon Kalfon, such employees
are changed, removed or terminated by the Purchaser, or they have their terms
of employment amended, with such events having a material negative impact on
the Companys ability to perform the [**] Project in accordance with the terms
of the [**] Agreements, then the [**] Indemnity shall lapse immediately and
the Sellers shall have no liability whatsoever under the [**] Indemnity (and
any Escrow Amount shall immediately be released in favour of the Sellers
(excluding any Pending Claims) if this occurs at a date which is after 18
months from Closing).

 

The Purchaser conducts its activities in accordance with the highest business,
ethical and legal standards. Toward that end, all of the Purchasers
employees are required to adhere to all applicable laws, rules and
regulations, as well as the companys internal policies, which include but are
not limited to the Purchasers Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and
its Guiding Principles. Such practices advance not only the interests of the
Purchaser and its employees, but also the interests of its partners and
customers; sound and ethical business practices lead to excellent results.
Once part of the Purchaser team, all employees of the Company will be
required to adhere to these same high standards, as embodied in the
Purchasers policies, and to follow the lawful direction of the Purchasers
management. Employees of the Company will be held accountable for their
actions and subject to the same disciplinary policies and procedures as any
other worldwide employee of the Purchaser. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to exempt any employee of the Company from adherence to the
Purchasers policies, standards and requirements, nor shall any disciplinary
action by the Purchaser for a violation of these policies, standards or
requirements be deemed a release of Sellers indemnification obligations with
respect to the [**] Project.



   6.11 | Employee Indemnity 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers will,
jointly and severally, be responsible for, will pay, and will indemnify Swiss
Franc for Swiss Franc and hold harmless the Purchaser from and against any and
all liabilities, costs and expenses resulting from, arising out of, or
relating to the fact that any Group Company promised to Ralph Baust, Volker
Heinze, Urs Fluck and Blaise Mayor to receive shares in the Parent Company or
the Company.

 



   6.12 | Lease Indemnity 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers will,
jointly and severally, be responsible for, will pay, and will indemnify Swiss
Franc for Swiss Franc and hold harmless the Purchaser from and against any and
all liabilities, costs and expenses exceeding an amount of CHF 60,000 and
resulting from, arising out of, or relating to the obligation of the Company
reinstate and/or renovate the premises located at rue des Bains 33, Geneva,
further to the termination of the associated lease agreement.
