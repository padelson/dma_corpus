make any non-monetary concession that would purport to bind Purchaser, its
Affiliates, the Business or any Conveyed Company following the Closing, in
each case without Purchaser's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the requisite consents are not obtained
prior to the Closing with respect to any such Equipment Lease, Intellectual
Property License, Permit, Assumed Contract, Contract, Purchased Asset or
right, upon obtaining the requisite third-party consents thereto, such
Equipment Leases, Intellectual Property Licenses, Permits, Assumed Contracts,
Contracts, Purchased Assets or rights, if otherwise includable in the
Purchased Assets or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall promptly be
transferred and assigned to Purchaser hereunder at no additional cost. Seller
and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith in respect of their obligations
pursuant to this Section 2.7(a).

 



 

(b) With respect to any Equipment Lease, Intellectual Property
License, Permit, Assumed Contract, Contract, Purchased Asset or right that is
not transferred and assigned to Purchaser at the Closing by reason of Section
2.7(a), for twelve (12) months after the Closing (or, if shorter, until any
requisite consent is obtained therefor and the same is transferred and
assigned to Purchaser), the Parties shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best
efforts, upon written request of Purchaser, in endeavoring to obtain for
Purchaser, at no cost to Seller, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates, an
arrangement with respect thereto to provide for Purchaser substantially
comparable benefits therein and to otherwise put Purchaser and Seller (and
their respective Affiliates) in the position they would have been in had such
Purchased Asset been transferred at the Closing. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, without further
consideration therefor, pay and remit to Purchaser or its Permitted Designee
all monies, rights and other consideration received in respect of such
Purchased Asset as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof
and Purchaser shall pay, perform and discharge fully, promptly when due, all
of the obligations of Seller and its Affiliates in respect of such performance
as would have been assumed by Purchaser hereunder if such Purchased Asset had
been transferred at the Closing. Other than with respect to the Retained
Liabilities, Purchaser agrees to indemnify Seller or any of its Affiliates in
respect of all Liabilities of Seller or any of its Affiliates in respect of
any such arrangement, continuing operations and underlying lease, license,
Contract, agreement or right.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required in connection with
the transfer of Purchased Assets, including from parties to the Equipment
Leases, Intellectual Property Licenses, Permits, Assumed Contracts and other
Contracts, and that such consents may not be obtained. Purchaser agrees that
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any Liability whatsoever
arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents that may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
because of the default under, or acceleration or termination of, any Equipment
Lease, Intellectual Property License, Permit, Assumed Contract, Contract or
right, as a result thereof, except to the extent that a failure to disclose
the need for any such consent constitutes a breach of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.5. Purchaser further agrees that no
condition to Purchaser's obligations to close the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be deemed not satisfied as a result of the failure to
obtain any such consent or as a result of any such default, acceleration or
termination.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Parties agree that it is advisable for the Commingled Contracts (other
than the Commingled Contracts set forth on _Schedule 2.7(d)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter) to be separated into separate Contracts between the
applicable third party, on the one hand, and each of (i) the business retained
by Seller and its Affiliates and (ii) the Business, on the other hand. The
Parties agree to cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to
provide reasonable assistance prior to and for twelve (12) months after the
Closing in effecting the separation of such Commingled Contracts on
substantially the same terms as currently in effect or other terms reasonably
mutually agreeable to the Parties, it being understood that neither the Seller
Entities, Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be required
to expend money, incur any Liability, commence any litigation or offer or
grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to effect
any such separation and in connection therewith, Seller shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates (including, if prior to the Closing, the Conveyed
Companies) not to, (A) commit to make any payments other than cash payments
that are Retained Liabilities or otherwise paid in full prior to the Closing
or (B) make any non-monetary concession that would purport to bind Purchaser,
its Affiliates, the Business or any Conveyed Company following the Closing, in
each case without the prior written consent of Purchaser (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). With respect to each such
Commingled Contract, until any separate contract is obtained therefor, the
Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts for twelve (12) months
after the Closing to obtain for each Party, at no cost to Seller, Purchaser or
any of their respective Affiliates, an arrangement with respect thereto to
provide for each Party substantially comparable benefits therein and to
otherwise put each Party (and their respective Affiliates) in the position
they would have been in had the rights and obligations relating to the
Business and the business retained by Seller and its Affiliates under such
Commingled Contract been separated at the Closing. The Party not retaining a
given Commingled Contract agrees to indemnify (in proportion to the relative
rights and obligations of the Parties under the Commingled Contract) the party
retaining the Commingled Contract or any of its Affiliates in respect of all
Liabilities of such retaining Party or any of its Affiliates in respect of any
such Commingled Contract arrangement. In furtherance of the foregoing, if
Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, or Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, receives any benefit or payment under any
Commingled Contract that relates to the portion of the Commingled Contract not
retained by such Party, Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, promptly deliver such benefit or payment to the
other Party.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) In the event that during the period prior to the Closing,
Purchaser identifies any service, other than a service set forth on _Schedule
2.7(e)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, that was provided to the Business
during the twelve (12) months immediately prior to the Effective Time by
Seller or any of its Affiliates, either directly or indirectly through third-
party service providers, that Service Recipient reasonably believes is
reasonably necessary for it and its Affiliates to operate the Business
following the Closing substantially as conducted during the twelve (12) month
period prior to the Effective Time (and which service is not contemplated
hereby or by any Ancillary Agreement to be provided through the Purchased
Assets or Conveyed Companies), Purchaser and Seller shall add such service to
the Transition Services Agreement such that Seller or its Affiliates will,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Transition Services Agreement
generally applicable to other services thereunder, provide (or arrange for the
provision of) such service to Purchaser and its Affiliates. Further, Purchaser
shall, at its sole option, and upon written notice to Seller no less than
thirty (30) days prior to the Closing, have the right to elect to not receive
one or more services that would otherwise be terminable by Purchaser in
accordance with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement if it were in
effect on the date hereof (i.e., any individual line item set forth on the
Services and Pricing Schedules), and such Services and Pricing Schedules shall
be updated accordingly prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that at
the time Purchaser elects to not receive any particular Service, it shall also
elect to not receive any related services that are expressly described as such
in the Services and Pricing Schedules to the Transition Services Agreement.
Prior to the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall discuss in good faith
reasonable requests by the other Party (i) to designate additional related
services that must be terminated concurrently and (ii) to unbundle separable
services included as a single service for the purpose of allowing individual
termination of such services (and the associated reduction in prices due to
any portion of such unbundled service not being provided pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement). In the event that Purchaser and Seller agree
with respect to additional related services that must be terminated
concurrently or the unbundling of separable services that may be terminated
individually (and the associated price reductions), Purchaser and Seller will
revise the Services and Pricing Schedules to the Transition Services Agreement
to reflect such agreement.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Purchase Price_. In consideration of the sale and
transfer of the Equity Interests and the Purchased Assets, Purchaser agrees to
purchase from the Equity Selling Entities the Equity Interests and to purchase
from the Asset Selling Entities the Purchased Assets, for an aggregate
purchase price equal to the Gross Purchase Price, subject to adjustment
pursuant to Section 2.9 (as so adjusted, the " _Aggregate Purchase Price_ ").
At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to Seller
an amount equal to the Gross Purchase Price, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts previously notified by Seller in
writing to Purchaser.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 2.9 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the Closing Date, and in any event not later
than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Purchaser for its review a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth Seller's good faith calculation of each of (i) the Closing
Working Capital, (ii) the Closing Cash, (iii) the Debt Adjustment Amount and
(iv) the Aggregate Purchase Price (the " _Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price_
") (in each case, together with reasonable supporting documentation). The
Closing Statement shall be prepared in a manner consistent with _Exhibit A_
and _Exhibit A1_.

 



 

(b) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall give the other Party and
its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
premises, books and records, and appropriate personnel of the Business, the
Conveyed Companies, Purchaser, Seller and their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, reasonably requested by such other Party for purposes of the
preparation or review of the Closing Statement in accordance with this Section
2.9.

 



 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt and solely as an illustration of
the methodology set forth in this Section 2.9, _Exhibit A1_ sets forth a
calculation of how Base Working Capital was derived. Purchaser shall instruct
its employees (including the Transferred Employees) and Representatives to
cooperate with, and promptly and completely respond to all reasonable requests
and inquiries of, Seller and its Representatives, and Seller and its
Representatives shall have reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, to all
relevant schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by Purchaser or its
Representatives (including its outside accountants) to the extent such
materials have been prepared by Purchaser or its Representatives and relate to
the calculation of the Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Cash and/or
the Debt Adjustment Amount in any respect (with all such information treated
as Purchaser Confidential Information subject to Section 5.18). Seller shall
instruct its employees and Representatives to cooperate with, and promptly and
completely respond to all reasonable requests and inquiries of, Purchaser and
its Representatives, and Purchaser and its Representatives shall have
reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, to all relevant schedules,
memoranda and other documents prepared by Seller or its Representatives
(including its outside accountants) to the extent such materials have been
prepared by Seller or its Representatives and relate to the calculation of the
Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Cash and/or the Debt Adjustment
Amount in any respect (with all such information subject to Section 5.18).

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Each Party and their respective accountants and financial
and other advisors may make reasonable inquiries of the other Party and/or
such other Party's accountants regarding questions concerning or disagreements
with the Closing Statement arising in the course of their preparation and
review. Purchaser shall complete its review of the Closing Statement within
sixty (60) days after the delivery thereof to Purchaser. Promptly following
completion of its review (but in no event later than the conclusion of the
sixty (60) day period), Purchaser may submit to Seller a letter regarding its
concurrence or disagreement with the accuracy of the Closing Statement;
provided that any such letter must specify (i) the items of the Closing
Statement with which Purchaser disagrees, (ii) the adjustments that Purchaser
proposes to be made to the Closing Statement (each, a " _Disputed Item_ ") and
(iii) the specific amount of such disagreement and supporting documentation
and calculations; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser may only
disagree with the Closing Statement to the extent Purchaser claims Seller did
not prepare the Closing Statement in a manner consistent with this Agreement
and the policies and principles set forth on _Exhibit A_ and _Exhibit A1_. If
Purchaser does not deliver a letter disagreeing with the accuracy of the
Closing Statement before the conclusion of such sixty (60) day period, the
Closing Statement shall be final and binding upon the Parties and Purchaser
shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts contained in the
Closing Statement. If Purchaser does deliver such a letter, following such
delivery, Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to resolve promptly
any disagreement as to the computation of any item in the Closing Statement.
Any items as to which there is no disagreement shall be deemed agreed. If a
resolution of such disagreement has not been effected within fifteen (15) days
(or longer, as mutually agreed by the Parties) after delivery of such letter,
then Seller and Purchaser shall submit any unresolved Disputed Item to the
Accountant for determination. The parties shall request that the determination
of the Accountant with respect to any such Disputed Item be completed within
thirty (30) days of submission of such Disputed Item to the Accountant and
shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement and be final and binding
upon Seller and Purchaser. The parties shall instruct the Accountant to adopt
a position within the range of positions submitted by Seller and Purchaser
with respect to any Disputed Item. The Accountant's determination regarding
any Disputed Item shall be based solely on whether Seller included such
Disputed Item in or excluded such Disputed Item from the Closing Statement or
calculated such Disputed Item, as the case may be, in a manner consistent with
the policies and principles set forth on _Exhibit A_ and _Exhibit A1_. The
Closing Working Capital as finally determined in accordance herewith shall be
referred to as the " _Final Closing Working Capital_." The Closing Cash as
finally determined in accordance herewith shall be referred to as the "
_Closing Cash Amount_." The Debt Adjustment Amount as finally determined in
accordance herewith shall be referred to as the " _Final Debt Adjustment
Amount_." The fees, costs, and expenses of the Accountant shall be shared as
follows:

 



 

(i) if the Accountant resolves all of the Disputed Items in
favor of Purchaser's position (the Final Closing Working Capital and/or the
Closing Cash Amount and/or the Final Debt Adjustment Amount, as the case may
be, so determined is referred to herein as the " _Low Value_ "), then Seller
shall be obligated to pay for all of the fees and expenses of the Accountant;

 



 

(ii) if the Accountant resolves all of the Disputed Items in
favor of Seller's position (the Final Closing Working Capital and/or the
Closing Cash Amount and/or the Final Debt Adjustment Amount, as the case may
be, so determined is referred to herein as the " _High Value_ "), then
Purchaser shall be obligated to pay for all of the fees and expenses of the
Accountant; and

 



 

(iii) if the Accountant neither resolves all of the Disputed Items
in favor of Purchaser's position nor resolves all of the Disputed Items in
favor of Seller's position (the Final Closing Working Capital and/or the
Closing Cash Amount and/or the Final Debt Adjustment Amount, as the case may
be, so determined is referred to herein as the " _Actual Value_ "), Seller
shall be responsible for such fraction of the fees and expenses of the
Accountant for the Final Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Cash
Amount and/or the Final Debt Adjustment Amount, as the case may be, equal to
(x) the difference between the High Value and the Actual Value over (y) the
difference between the High Value and the Low Value, for the Final Closing
Working Capital and/or the Closing Cash Amount and/or the Final Debt
Adjustment Amount, as the case may be, and Purchaser shall be responsible for
the remainder of the fees and expenses of the Accountant.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) If the Final Closing Working Capital:

 



 

(i) is equal to or greater than $26,250,000 (the " _Lower
Working Capital Limit_ ") and is equal to or less than $27,750,000 (the "
_Upper Working Capital Limit_ "), then no adjustments will be made to the
Aggregate Purchase Price in respect of the Final Closing Working Capital;

 



 

(ii) exceeds the Upper Working Capital Limit, then the Aggregate
Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by which the Final Closing
Working Capital exceeds the Upper Working Capital Limit; or

 



 

(iii) is less than the Lower Working Capital Limit, then the
Aggregate Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount by which the Lower
Working Capital Limit exceeds the Final Closing Working Capital.

 



 

(f) The Aggregate Purchase Price shall be decreased by the
Final Debt Adjustment Amount and increased by the Closing Cash Amount.

 



 

(g) If the Aggregate Purchase Price as finally calculated
pursuant to this Section 2.9 exceeds the Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price,
Purchaser shall be obligated to pay Seller the amount of such excess. If the
Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price as finally calculated pursuant to this
Section 2.9 exceeds the Aggregate Purchase Price, Seller shall be obligated to
pay Purchaser the amount of such excess.

 



 

(h) Any payments to be made pursuant to Section 2.9(g) shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated in writing by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be,
within five (5) Business Days after the final determination of the Aggregate
Purchase Price. Any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall be made
with interest (such interest to be calculated on the basis of a year of three-
hundred sixty (360) days and the actual number of days elapsed) on such amount
from (i) the date of the delivery of a letter of disagreement, if there is a
disagreement or (ii) 35 days from the Closing if there is no such letter of
disagreement, to the date of such payment at a rate equal to five percent (5%)
per annum.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that the Aggregate Purchase Price
(reduced by the Agreed China Valuation pursuant to Section 5.27) shall be
allocated in a manner consistent with _Schedule 2.10_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter (the " _Jurisdictional Allocation_ ").

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that a portion of the Aggregate Purchase
Price as determined pursuant to the Agreed China Valuation shall be allocated
to the Equity Interests of the Seller China Legal Entities (the " _China
Allocation_ ").

 



 

 



   



 

(c) No later than the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after the
determination of the Agreed China Valuation and (B) thirty (30) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a statement
allocating the Aggregate Purchase Price (reduced by the Agreed China
Valuation; plus Assumed Liabilities, to the extent properly taken into account
under Section 1060 of the Code) (the " _Further Allocation_ " and together
with the Jurisdictional Allocation and the China Allocation, the "
_Allocations_ ") among the Equity Interests (with the exception of the Seller
China Legal Entities) __ and the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code. Such Further Allocation shall incorporate, reflect, and be
consistent with the Jurisdictional Allocation. Each of Seller and its
Affiliates on the one hand and Purchaser and the Conveyed Companies on the
other shall (x) be bound by the Allocations for purposes of determining any
Taxes; (y) prepare and file, and cause its Affiliates to prepare and file, its
Tax Returns on a basis consistent with the Allocations and (z) take no
position, and cause its Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with the
Allocations on any applicable Tax Return or in any proceeding before any
Taxing Authority or otherwise. In the event that any Jurisdictional Allocation
is disputed by any Taxing Authority, the Party receiving notice of the dispute
shall promptly notify the other Party hereto, and Seller and Purchaser agree
to use their commercially reasonable efforts to defend such Allocation in any
Contest.

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall notify Seller of any disagreement with the
proposed Further Allocation within five (5) Business Days of Seller's receipt
of the proposed Further Allocation. If Seller and Purchaser fail to agree on
the Further Allocation within ten (10) Business Days of Seller's receipt of
Purchaser's notice of disagreement, such matter shall be referred to a law
firm or accounting firm (the " _Arbiter_ ") for binding arbitration. Seller
and Purchaser shall mutually agree on an Arbiter that is independent of both
Seller and Purchaser. In the event that Seller and Purchaser cannot agree on
an Arbiter within five (5) days, Seller and Purchaser each shall select a law
firm or an accounting firm, and the two (2) firms selected shall mutually
select a third law firm or accounting firm, independent of both Seller and
Purchaser, to act as the Arbiter. The choice of an Arbiter by the two (2)
firms pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be binding on the Parties and
shall occur no later than twenty (20) Business Days following Seller's notice
of any disagreement with the Further Allocation. Within twenty (20) Business
Days of the selection of the Arbiter, Seller and Purchaser shall deliver to
the Arbiter copies of any schedules or documentation (including any third-
party valuation or similar report) that may reasonably be helpful to or
required by the Arbiter to make its determination. Each of Purchaser and
Seller shall be entitled to submit to the Arbiter a memorandum setting forth
its position with respect to such arbitration. The Arbiter shall render a
determination within fifteen (15) Business Days of its selection.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 2.10(d), the Arbiter may, at its
sole discretion, amend the procedures contained herein. The determination of
the Arbiter shall be final and binding on all Parties and shall be the
conclusive "Further Allocation" for purposes of this Agreement. The costs
incurred in retaining the Arbiter shall be shared equally, fifty percent (50%)
by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser.

 



 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, the
Parties agree that any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.9 will not result in
any change to the China Allocation (which, in all circumstances, shall be
equal to the Agreed China Valuation), and any such adjustment will instead
result in an adjustment to the Jurisdictional Allocation.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 2.11 _Closings_.

 



 

(a) The Closing shall occur at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, at 10:00 A.M.,
Eastern Time on the third (3rd) Business Day following the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions precedent specified in Article VI (other than the
conditions to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the waiver or
satisfaction of such conditions) or at such other times and places as the
Parties may mutually agree; _provided_ that, at the election of either Seller
or Purchaser, the Closing shall take place on the first Eligible Closing Date
that is at least five (5) Business Days following the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions precedent specified in Article VI (other than the conditions
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the waiver or satisfaction of
such conditions). " _Eligible Closing Date_ " means a Business Day that is the
last Business Day of Seller's fiscal month end. The date on which the Closing
occurs is called the " _Closing Date_ ". The Closing shall be deemed to occur
and be effective as of 11:59 P.M. local time in each applicable jurisdiction
on the Closing Date, irrespective of the actual time of occurrence of such
Closing (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to Seller (i) the Gross Purchase Price by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts specified by Seller,
(ii) the officer's certificate referenced in Section 6.3(c) and (iii) each of
the Ancillary Agreements, duly executed by Purchaser or its applicable
Affiliate.

 



 

(c) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to Purchaser (i) all certificates (if any) representing the Equity
Interests, (ii) the officer's certificate referenced in Section 6.2(d), (iii)
each of the Ancillary Agreements, duly executed by Seller or its applicable
Affiliate and (iv) written resignations of each director, officer, individual
manager or foreign equivalent thereof of each Conveyed Company, in his or her
capacity as such, as Purchaser shall have requested at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 2.12 _Tax Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Aggregate Purchase Price and from any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any
applicable Tax Law. In any case where such withholding or deduction is
required, Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to provide notice to Seller
at least twenty (20) days prior to withholding any amount pursuant to this
Section 2.12, and the Parties shall use reasonable efforts to reduce or avoid
such withholding where possible. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such withholding was made.

 



 

ARTICLE III 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

 



 

Except as set forth in the letter (the " _Seller Disclosure Letter_ ")
delivered by Seller to Purchaser concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement (it being understood that any matter disclosed on any Schedule of
the Seller Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be disclosed on any other
Schedule of the Seller Disclosure Letter to the extent its relevance is
reasonably apparent on its face), Seller hereby represents and warrants to
Purchaser as follows:

 



 

 



   



 

Section 3.1 _Organization and Qualification_. Seller is a
corporation duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of Switzerland.
Each Equity Selling Entity and Asset Selling Entity is a corporation, limited
liability company or other entity type duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (or local legal equivalent, if any) under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and is duly qualified and in good standing
(or local legal equivalent, if any) under the Laws of each jurisdiction where
such qualification is required, except where the lack of such qualification or
good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to be material to the Business, the Conveyed Companies and the
Purchased Assets, taken as a whole. Each Asset Selling Entity and each
Conveyed Company has full corporate or company power and authority to enable
it to own, lease or otherwise hold the Purchased Assets owned, leased or
otherwise held by it and to conduct the Business as presently conducted by it.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Corporate Authority; Binding Effect_.

 



 

(a) Seller has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement and to perform
its obligations hereunder and thereunder. Prior to the Closing, each other
Seller Entity and Conveyed Company shall have all requisite corporate (or
comparable) power and authority to execute and deliver each Ancillary
Agreement to which it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder.
The execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement, each Ancillary
Agreement and each other document, agreement or instrument to be executed and
delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement, and the performance by Seller
of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, including the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such Ancillary Agreements,
have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of
Seller. The execution and delivery by each Affiliate of Seller of each
Ancillary Agreement or other document, agreement or instrument to be executed
and delivered by such Affiliate pursuant to this Agreement, and the
performance by such Affiliate of its obligations hereunder and thereunder,
including the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, at the Closing will have been duly authorized by all requisite
corporate (or comparable) action on the part of such Affiliate.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) This Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement, when executed
and delivered by Seller (or any of its Affiliates that may be a party to any
Ancillary Agreement, as applicable), assuming due execution and delivery
hereof by Purchaser and/or each other counterparty thereto, as applicable,
constitutes the valid and binding obligations of Seller (or such Affiliate, as
applicable), enforceable against Seller (or such Affiliate, as applicable) in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or
similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally or by general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity
or at law).

 



 

Section 3.3 _Conveyed Companies; Capital Structure_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Conveyed Companies is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (or local legal equivalent, if any) under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, except in jurisdictions where the
failure to be in good standing (or local legal equivalent, if any) would not
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the Business, the Conveyed Companies and the Purchased Assets, taken as a
whole, with the corporate or limited liability company (or comparable) power
and authority to own and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as currently conducted. Each of the Conveyed Companies is duly
qualified to do business and in good standing (or local legal equivalent, if
any) in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or properties makes
such qualification necessary, except in jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Business, the Conveyed Companies and the Purchased
Assets, taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) _Schedule 3.3(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets
forth the authorized capitalization of the Conveyed Companies and the number
of shares of each class of capital stock or other equity interests in each
such Conveyed Company, which are issued and outstanding and the owner thereof.
All shares of each class of capital stock or other equity interests in each
such Conveyed Company are duly authorized, validly issued and outstanding, and
(to the extent applicable in its jurisdiction of organization) fully paid and
non-assessable, and were not issued in violation of any right of first
refusal, preemptive or similar rights. There are no outstanding warrants,
options, agreements, subscriptions, preemptive rights, rights of first
refusal, anti-dilution rights or other rights (contingent or otherwise),
convertible or exchangeable securities or other Contracts pursuant to which
any of the Conveyed Companies is or may become obligated to issue, sell,
purchase, return or redeem any shares of capital stock or other securities or
other equity interests of the Conveyed Companies, and no equity securities or
other equity interests of any of the Conveyed Companies are reserved for
issuance for any purpose. The Equity Selling Entities and the Conveyed
Entities own of record and beneficially all of the outstanding Equity
Interests, as indicated on _Schedule 3.3(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
free and clear of all Liens. None of the Conveyed Companies own any capital
stock or other equity interests in any entity, or have any commitments or
obligations to acquire any capital stock or equity interests or make any other
investment in any entity, other than the Conveyed Entities.

 



 

(c) Each of the Conveyed Companies is in material compliance
with its organizational documents.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement by Seller (and
any of its Affiliates that may be a party to any Ancillary Agreement, as
applicable), and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority other than (i) as set forth on Schedule 3.4 of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, (ii) any actions or filings that may be required
solely by reason of Purchaser's (and its applicable Affiliates') participation
in the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) any such other action or

as applicable) in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be

Ancillary Agreement.

of the Business and the cash management procedures as currently conducted by
Seller, the Seller Entities and the Conveyed Companies and (ii) withdraw all

Disclosure Letter). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Asset Selling Entities and the Conveyed Companies shall be

consistent with past practice. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
Purchaser, directly or indirectly, rights to control or direct the operations

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Restructuring), permit or cause any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to do
any of the foregoing or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing, or agree

Section 5.4, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, and to
applicable Law, each Party agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, and assist and cooperate with the

connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to obtain the
required consents from Governmental Authorities, including antitrust clearance

practicable date comply with (or properly reduce the scope of) any formal or
informal request for additional information or documentary material received

consult and cooperate with Seller, and consider in good faith the views of
Seller, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,

communications made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any consent required from a Governmental

hereof, take all actions necessary to file or cause to be filed the filings
required of it or any of its Affiliates under any applicable Laws in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; (y)
consult and cooperate with Purchaser, and consider in good faith the views of

with proceedings under or relating to any consent required from a Governmental
Authority; and (z) use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions
necessary to obtain the required consents from Governmental Authorities as
promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date. Each of the
Parties will promptly notify the other Party of any written communication made
to or received by such Party from any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither Party will participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Authority in
respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other Party
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives
the other Party the opportunity to attend, and each Party will furnish the
other Party with copies of all correspondence, filings and written
communications between them and their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives on one hand and any such Governmental Authority or its
respective staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than the portions of such
correspondence, filings and written communications that include confidential
or proprietary information relating to Purchaser's business or the business of
Purchaser's Affiliates.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of all filing
fees under any Antitrust Laws.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or
by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or
other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree
to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating
to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation could
reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of,
or increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental
Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially
increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an Order prohibiting
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) materially
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such Order on appeal or
otherwise; or (iv) materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(d) Subject to Section 5.4(d)(v), Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take all actions requested by any Antitrust
Authority, or necessary to resolve any objections that may be asserted by any
Antitrust Authority, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any Antitrust Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall:

 



 

(i) at Purchaser's sole cost, comply with all restrictions and
conditions, if any, imposed or requested by any (A) Antitrust Authority with
respect to Antitrust Laws in connection with granting any necessary clearance
or terminating any applicable waiting period including (x) agreeing to sell,
divest, hold separate, license, cause a third-party to acquire, or otherwise
dispose of, the Business, the Purchased Assets, any Subsidiary, operations,
divisions, businesses, product lines, customers or assets of Purchaser, its
Affiliates or any Conveyed Company contemporaneously with or after the Closing
and regardless as to whether a third-party purchaser has been identified or
approved prior to the Closing, or agreeing to any other structural or conduct
remedy (a " _Divestiture_ "), (y) taking or committing to take such other
actions that may limit Purchaser, its Affiliates or any Conveyed Company's
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of
its operations, divisions, businesses, products lines, customers or assets and
(z) entering into any Order, consent decree or other agreement to effectuate
any of the foregoing or (B) third party in connection with a Divestiture;

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) terminate any Contract or other business relationship as
may be required to obtain any necessary clearance of any Antitrust Authority
or to obtain termination of any applicable waiting period under any Antitrust
Laws;

 



 

(iii) not extend any waiting period with any Antitrust Authority
without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned; and

 



 

(iv) at the request of Seller, use its best efforts to oppose any
request for the entry of, and seek to have vacated or terminated, any order,
judgment, decree, injunction or ruling of any Antitrust Authority that would
reasonably be expected to restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including by
defending through litigation, any action asserted by any Person in any court
or before any Antitrust Authority and by exhausting all avenues of appeal,
including appealing properly any adverse decision or order by any Antitrust
Authority, or, if requested by Seller, Purchaser shall commence or threaten to
commence and pursue vigorously any action Seller reasonably believes to be
helpful in obtaining any necessary clearance of any Antitrust Authority or
obtaining termination of any applicable waiting period under any Antitrust
Laws, or in terminating any outstanding action, it being understood that the
costs and expenses of all such actions shall be borne by Purchaser.

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement will obligate or require Purchaser or its
Affiliates to (and Seller shall not without Purchaser's prior written consent
agree to or permit its Affiliates to agree to) take or cause to be taken any
action (or refrain or cause to refrain from taking any action) or agree or
cause to agree to any restriction, limitation or condition, as a condition to
or in connection with obtaining any consent of any Antitrust Authority or any
other Governmental Authority or otherwise in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case if such action (or
refraining from such action), restriction, limitation or condition would have
or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on the Business (a " _Burdensome Condition_ ").

 



 

Section 5.5 _Business Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) _Conveyed Company Business Employees_. The employment of
each Conveyed Company Business Employee shall not terminate upon the Closing,
but shall continue with the applicable Conveyed Company on terms consistent
with Section 5.5(c).

 



 

 



   



 

(b) _Asset Selling Entity Business Employee_. With regard to any
Asset Selling Entity Business Employee, within a reasonable period of time
(but not less than thirty (30) days) prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser or
its Affiliates, as appropriate, shall (i) offer employment to each such Asset
Selling Entity Business Employee, commencing as of the Closing Date or (ii)
continue to employ (where employment continues automatically by operation of
applicable Law) each Asset Selling Entity Business Employee (and such
individual does not object where such right exists under applicable Law) as of
the Closing Date, in each case, on terms consistent with Section 5.5(c).
Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to effect Purchaser's
obligations under this Section 5.5(b), including, subject to applicable Law,
by making Business Employees reasonably accessible to Purchaser and using
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser in its efforts to secure
acceptance of such offers of employment from all such Business Employees. With
respect to any Offeree, LTD Employee or any Business Employee within the
meaning of such term as defined in clause (iii) thereof who becomes a
Transferred Employee, all references to "Closing" and "Closing Date" as used
in this Section 5.5 shall be deemed to refer to the date on which such
Business Employee becomes a Transferred Employee.

 



 

(c) _Terms and Conditions of Employment_. Purchaser covenants
and agrees to continue to provide each Transferred Employee who is not covered
by a Collective Bargaining Agreement, for a period of at least 12 months
following the Closing Date (or until such Transferred Employee's employment
sooner terminates) with the following terms and conditions of employment:

 



 

(i) substantially comparable job or position and a primary
work location no more than 50 miles from such Transferred Employee's primary
work location immediately prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(ii) pay that is no less favorable than as provided to such
Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that
for purposes of the foregoing, "pay" shall include base salary or wages plus
any commission, variable pay target bonus, incentive compensation, premium
pay, overtime and shift differentials, but not stock options or other equity-
based compensation;

 



 

(iii) severance entitlements as set forth in Section 5.5(e) below;

 



 

(iv) equity-based compensation no less favorable than as provided
to Purchaser's similarly situated employees; and

 



 

(v) other compensation and employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the other compensation and
employee benefits provided to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date.

 



 

With respect to each Transferred Employee who holds an equity incentive award
that was granted under a Business Benefit Plan and that is fully or partially
forfeited as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Purchaser shall grant such Transferred Employee a replacement award (or
awards) that is/are substantially comparable to such forfeited award (or the
forfeited portion thereof) in terms of value, duration of vesting period
(which shall not exceed the vesting period of the forfeited award), forfeiture
provisions, and such other terms as may be material; provided that Purchaser
may determine that such replacement award shall be denominated in cash.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) _Provision of Health Benefits; Certain Welfare Plan
Matters_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide or cause
to be provided coverage to all Transferred Employees located in the United
States and their respective spouses and dependents under a group health plan
sponsored by Purchaser. With respect to such health plan and any other welfare
benefit plans in which Transferred Employees located in the United States are
eligible to participate, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) ensure that no waiting periods, exclusions or limitations with respect
to any pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good health or
actively-at-work exclusions are applicable to such Transferred Employees or
their spouses, dependents or beneficiaries, and (ii) provide or cause to be
provided that any costs or expenses incurred by such Transferred Employees
(and their respective spouses, dependents and beneficiaries) up to (and
including) the Closing Date shall be applied for purposes of satisfying
applicable deductible, co-payment, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
provisions under any such health or welfare benefit plans. Purchaser shall be
responsible under the employee welfare benefit plans of Purchaser for all
amounts payable by reason of claims incurred by Transferred Employees and
their eligible dependents and beneficiaries after the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) _Severance_.

 



 

(i) Purchaser shall have in effect for at least 12 months
following the Closing Date severance plans, practices and policies applicable
to each Transferred Employee that are not less favorable in the aggregate than
the plans, practices and policies applicable to such Transferred Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller from any
Termination Amounts with respect to all Transferred Employees whose employment
is terminated by Purchaser on or after the Closing Date, including
reimbursement to Seller of any Termination Amounts payable by Seller or any of
its Affiliates to any of such Transferred Employees. In addition, in
accordance with Section 2.4Section 2.4(h) of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller from all claims and Liabilities with
respect to any Business Employee who does not accept an offer of employment or
continued employment, as applicable, from Purchaser or its Affiliate that is
not a Qualifying Offer and whose employment is subsequently terminated by
Seller or any of its Affiliates. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to
minimize the Deal Related Severance and Labor Related Payments. If any
Retained Severance becomes payable by a Conveyed Company to a Transferred
Employee following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall (or shall cause such
Conveyed Company to) promptly pay such Retained Severance to such Transferred
Employee, and Seller shall promptly reimburse Purchaser or such Conveyed
Company, as applicable. In addition, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
Purchaser from all claims and Liabilities with respect to any individual who
is entitled to Retained Severance or who is listed on Schedule 1.1(d) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter.

 



 

 



   



 

(f) _Liabilities_. 

  

(i) As of the Closing, each Transferred Employee shall cease
active participation in, and to the extent applicable, shall cease accruing
benefits under, each Business Benefit Plan other than, to the extent
applicable, the Assumed Plans or Conveyed Company Benefits Plans. Immediately
upon the Closing, Seller shall cease to provide active coverage for any
Transferred Employee under the Business Benefit Plans, except as may be
otherwise provided under the Transition Services Agreement. 



 

(ii) In accordance with Section 2.4(h) and 2.4(i) of this
Agreement: from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume, honor and
be solely responsible for paying, providing and satisfying when due the
following: (i) all accrued vacation, personal days, sick pay and other paid
time off for Transferred Employees earned but unused as of the Closing Date,
and (ii) all compensation (including salary, wages, commissions, bonuses,
incentive compensation, overtime, premium pay and shift differentials),
vacation, personal days, sick pay and other paid time off, benefits and
benefit claims, severance and termination pay (including any employer sided
Taxes or other payments related thereto), notice and benefits under all
applicable Laws and under any Assumed Plan or Conveyed Company Benefit Plan,
in each case, accruing, incurred or arising as a result of employment or
separation from employment with Purchaser after the Closing Date with respect
to Transferred Employees. In the event that Seller is required to retain,
honor, pay or provide any of the items contemplated to be assumed, honored,
paid or provided by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.5(f)(ii), Purchaser
will indemnify and hold harmless Seller for any such items so retained,
honored, paid or provided by Seller.

 



 

(iii) Purchaser shall pay Seller an amount equal to the
Unattributable Employee Liabilities that are included in the Closing Working
Capital thirty (30) days after the agreement of the Final Working Capital.

 



 

(iv) In the event that Seller is not legally permitted under
applicable Law, on or prior to the Closing, to cause a Benefit Plan that is
maintained by Seller or an Asset Selling Entity to assume the assets and
liabilities under Plan #2 set forth on _Section 1.1(e)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule in respect of those employees of the Conveyed Company that
sponsors such Plan #2 who are not Transferred Employees (the " _Non-
Transferring Employee Plan Liability_ "), or to otherwise settle or satisfy
such Non-Transferring Employee Plan Liability, Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that all such assets and the Non-Transferring Employee Plan Liability
shall remain a Liability of the applicable Conveyed Company as of the Closing,
and the Parties agree that the net liability amount of such Non-Transferring
Employee Plan Liability (calculated in the same manner as the Identified
Pension Obligations as of the Closing Date) shall be treated as a Retained
Liability for all purposes under this Agreement. The Parties further agree to
negotiate in good faith an appropriate settlement of the Retained Liability.

 



 

 



   



 

(g) _COBRA_. Seller shall remain responsible for providing COBRA
continuation coverage to any Business Employee who does not become a
Transferred Employee (and his or her spouse and dependents).

 



 

(h) _Credited Service_. With respect to each Benefit Plan that
is contributed to, sponsored, maintained or entered into by Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates for the benefit of Transferred Employees, Purchaser shall
recognize or shall cause its Affiliates to recognize, for all Transferred
Employees from and after the Closing Date, credit for all service with Seller
and its Affiliates (and their respective predecessors) prior to the Closing
Date for all purposes (including eligibility to participate, vesting credit,
eligibility to commence benefits, benefit accrual and severance); _provided_
that such service shall not be credited for purposes of benefit accrual under
any defined benefit pension plan or retiree welfare plan or to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits.

 



 

(i) _Savings Plans_. Each Transferred Employee who is a
participant in the Tyco Electronics Corporation Retirement Savings and
Investment Plan (the " _Seller Savings Plan_ ") shall cease to be an active
participant in such plan effective as of the Closing Date. Within sixty (60)
days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have, or shall cause one of
its Affiliates to have, in effect a defined contribution plan that is
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that includes a qualified cash
or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the
" _Purchaser Savings Plan_ ") in which Transferred Employees who meet the
eligibility criteria thereof shall be eligible to participate. Seller shall
cause each Transferred Employee to become fully vested in his or her account
balance in the Seller Savings Plan effective as of the Closing Date. Purchaser
agrees to cause the Purchaser Savings Plan to accept rollovers by Transferred
Employees from the Seller Savings Plan, including promissory notes evidencing
all outstanding loans.

 



 

(j) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the
generality of Section 10.6, the provisions of this Section 5.5, and Section
5.6, Section 5.7 and Section 5.8 are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement and no current or former employee, director or independent
contractor of Seller, Purchaser or their respective Affiliates or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
construed (i) as the establishment or adoption of, or an amendment to, any
Benefit Plan for any purpose, or otherwise limit the right of Seller,
Purchaser or their respective Affiliates, to amend, modify or terminate any
such Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms and applicable Law, (ii) to
confer upon any employee, director or independent contractor of Seller,
Purchaser or their respective Affiliates any right to continue in the employ
or service of Seller, Purchaser or their respective Affiliates, or (iii) to
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Seller, Purchaser or their
respective Affiliates to discharge or terminate the services of any such
employee, director or independent contractor at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.6 _Wage Reporting_. Purchaser and Seller shall utilize,
or cause their Affiliates to utilize, the standard procedure set forth in
Section 4 of Rev. Proc. 2004-53 with respect to United States wage reporting
for the full calendar year in which the Closing occurs, pursuant to which
Purchaser and Seller shall each perform all wage reporting duties for the
wages that it pays to the Transferred Employees. Seller shall prepare and
furnish Forms W-2 for the Transferred Employees for wages paid by Seller and
Purchaser shall prepare and furnish Forms W-2 for the Transferred Employees
for wages paid by Purchaser. Seller shall retain all Transferred Employees'
Forms W-4 and W-5. Purchaser shall obtain new Forms W-4 and W-5 from the
Transferred Employees.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Assumption of Assumed Plans_. Effective on and after
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, adopt the
Assumed Plans and assume all Liabilities and responsibilities of the
applicable Seller Entity thereunder.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Non-US Employees_. For any Transferred Employees who
are principally based outside of the United States, the provisions of Sections
5.5, 5.6 and 5.7 shall apply to such employees _mutatis mutandis_ to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Purchaser acknowledges that the
Seller Entities have not taken, and do not intend to take, any action required
to comply with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws or similar Laws.
Except as otherwise contemplated by Section 2.12, Purchaser shall not withhold
any portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price based on such non-compliance in
and of itself. The foregoing shall not limit any representations or warranties
of Seller or any of its Affiliates in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Seller Retained Marks_. Promptly following the Closing,
Purchaser shall cause each division of the Business and each Conveyed Company
(each, a " _Purchased Division_ ") to change its name to a name that does not
include any of the Seller Retained Marks or any derivatives or variations
thereof or anything confusingly similar thereto. Following the Closing, and
except as specifically provided below, Purchaser, each Affiliate thereof, the
Purchased Division(s) and their respective directors, officers, successors,
assigns, agents or representatives shall not register or attempt to register,
and shall not directly or indirectly use, including in signage, corporate
letterhead, business cards, internet websites, marketing material, packaging
and the like, or in connection with any products or services anywhere in the
world in any medium, any Seller Retained Marks existing as of the Closing
Date, or any derivatives or variations thereof or anything confusingly similar
thereto, nor shall any of them challenge or assist any third party in opposing
the rights of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller anywhere in the world in any
such Seller Retained Marks existing as of the Closing Date. For the avoidance
of doubt, in no event shall any of the Transferred Intellectual Property be
deemed to constitute Intellectual Property that includes, is identical to or
is confusingly similar to, any of Seller Retained Marks. Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that no right or grant is provided for herein for
Purchaser or any Purchased Division to (i) except as expressly permitted in
this Section 5.10, use the Seller Retained Marks alone or in combination with
any other mark, name or term or (ii) grant sublicenses to the Seller Retained
Marks for any purpose whatsoever. Subject to the restrictions set forth
herein, Seller hereby grants to Purchaser effective as of the Closing Date a
limited, personal, nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-
free license, for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the
date that is (A) twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, solely to use
tools, dies and molds acquired by Purchaser hereunder which carry one or more
of the Seller Retained Marks to be cast, struck or molded into Inventory, and
(B) eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, solely to use the Seller
Retained Marks and the Registered Combined Marks to the extent necessary to
exhaust any Inventory existing as of the Closing Date. Purchaser shall in any
event phase out use of tools, dies and molds as soon as is reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date and, in particular, shall if practicable
remove the cast for such marks from each such tool, die or mold on the first
occasion after the Closing Date when such tool, die or mold is refurbished
(but in any event by the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date). In no event shall Purchaser be permitted to use the Seller Retained
Marks or the Registered Combined Marks to exhaust any Inventory after the date
that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date. All goodwill associated
with the use of Seller Retained Marks as permitted hereunder shall inure to
the sole and exclusive benefit of Seller. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10 shall apply
_mutatis mutandis_ to the MONDRAGON name and mark which has been previously
divested by Seller or its Affiliates to a third party.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.11 _Purchased Marks_. Subject to the restrictions set forth
herein, Purchaser hereby grants to Seller and its Affiliates, effective as of
the Closing Date, a limited, personal, nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-
sublicensable, royalty-free license under the Trademarks included in the
Purchased Assets (the " _Purchased Marks_ ") solely to use such Purchased
Marks in any marketing materials (including on any websites) that exist on the
date of the Closing; _provided_ that the foregoing license shall not be
construed as permitting Seller or any of its Affiliates to market or sell any
products or services under the Purchased Marks. Following the Closing, and
except as specifically provided above, Seller, each Affiliate thereof, and
their respective directors, officers, successors, assigns, agents or
representatives agree that it shall not register or attempt to register, and
shall not directly or indirectly use, including in signage, corporate
letterhead, business cards, internet websites, marketing material, packaging
and the like, or in connection with any products or services anywhere in the
world in any medium, any Purchased Marks existing as of the Closing Date or
any derivatives or variations thereof or anything confusingly similar thereto,
nor shall any of them challenge or assist any third party in opposing the
rights of Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser anywhere in the world in any
such Purchased Marks existing as of the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall any of the retained Intellectual Property of the
Seller be deemed to constitute Intellectual Property that includes, is
identical to or is confusingly similar to, any of the Purchased Marks. Seller
acknowledges and agrees that no right or grant is provided for herein for
Seller to (i) except as expressly permitted in this Section 5.11, use the
Purchased Marks alone or in combination with any other mark, name or term or
(ii) grant sublicenses to the Purchased Marks for any purpose whatsoever. All
goodwill associated with the use of Purchased Marks as permitted hereunder
shall inure to the sole and exclusive benefit of Purchaser. To the extent that
Purchaser notifies Seller in writing of any specific use of the Purchased
Marks, after the Closing Date, on any Internet web sites operated by Seller or
any of its Affiliates, which use Purchaser reasonably believes may cause
consumer confusion, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remove
such use of the Purchased Marks within ninety (90) days of receipt of such
notice.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.12 _Intellectual Property Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that Seller and its
Affiliates shall retain ownership of any and all Trademark registrations or
applications for registration that include or incorporate both a Seller
Retained Mark and a Purchased Mark (the " _Registered Combined Marks_ ").
Subject to the limited rights set forth in Section 5.10 and Section 5.11, from
and after the Closing Date, neither Party nor any of its Affiliates shall
market or sell any products or services under the Registered Combined Marks or
otherwise use the Registered Combined Marks in any manner. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.12(a) shall be construed as restricting or
limiting (i) Seller or any of its Affiliates from using or registering any
Seller Retained Mark on a standalone basis or in combination with any other
Trademark (other than a Purchased Mark), or (ii) Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates from using or registering any Purchased Mark on a standalone basis
or in combination with any other Trademark (other than a Seller Retained
Mark).

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
effective as of the Closing Date, Seller (on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries) hereby grants and agrees to grant to Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Conveyed Companies) a non-

Seller shall not be required to undertake any unduly burdensome efforts with
respect to any such Transferred Intellectual Property that has expired or been
abandoned by Seller or its Affiliates less than six (6) years immediately

reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements to disclose such
information in a way that would not waive such privilege).

certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other comparable organizational
documents of each of the Conveyed Companies shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification than are set forth in such documents

Company Covered Person may have under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws

Companies, any other indemnification arrangement, applicable Laws or
otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.15 shall survive the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and are expressly intended to benefit
each Conveyed Company Covered Person.

Business, so long as Seller's and its Subsidiaries' aggregate investment
represents less than fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding voting and
economic interest in such third Person;

 



 

(ii) acquiring (each, an " _Acquisition Transaction_ ") an
interest (whether by merger, stock purchase, asset purchase, other business

(b) The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that (i) Seller is
familiar with confidential information of or pertaining to the Business, (ii)
the covenants and agreements set forth in this Section 5.23 were a material
inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder and (iii) the restrictive covenants set forth in this
Section 5.23 are reasonable in terms of duration, scope and area restrictions
and are necessary to protect the goodwill of the Business and to prevent the
impairment of the value of the substantial investment therein being made by
Purchaser hereunder. Notwithstanding Section 10.15, the Parties hereto agree
that, if any court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable
judgment determines that a specified time period, a specified geographical
area, a specified business limitation or any other relevant feature of this
Section 5.23 is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a
lesser time period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant
feature which is determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and
not against public policy may be enforced against Seller and its Subsidiaries
(as applicable). It is agreed that any breach or threatened breach of the
restrictive covenants set forth in this Section 5.23 would cause irreparable
injury to the Business and that money damages would not provide an adequate
remedy to Purchaser.

Seller's or its Affiliates' occurrence-based third-party liability insurance
policies, (i) Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of any matter that is
reasonably expected to give rise to a claim under any such policy (provided,
that, the failure to promptly notify Seller shall not relieve Seller from its
obligations under clause (ii), except to the extent that Seller's ability to
pursue such claim or recover under such policies is actually and materially
prejudiced thereby), and (ii) Purchaser may make claims, or Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, make claims, under such policies to the extent
such coverage and limits are available under such policies and any insurance
proceeds received with respect thereto shall be promptly delivered to
Purchaser or, at Purchaser's written direction, its Permitted Designee. Seller
agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue all such claims;
_provided_ that Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for its direct out-of-pocket
costs incurred in such pursuit; _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser shall
exclusively bear (and Seller shall have no obligation to repay or reimburse
Purchaser for) the amount of any deductibles associated with claims made under
such policies and programs except to the extent Purchaser is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. Purchaser and Seller shall (at
Purchaser's expense) cooperate in connection with making such claim and each
Party shall provide the other with all reasonably requested information
necessary to make such claim. Promptly after the Closing Seller shall have
Purchaser and its Affiliates named as (x) additional insureds under the
Seller's or its Affiliates' occurrence-based third-party liability insurance
policies with respect to events relating to the Assumed Liabilities or the
Conveyed Companies or their assets that occurred or existed prior to the
Closing and (b) loss payee parties under Seller's or its Affiliate's first-
party insurance in force as of the date hereof; _provided_ that, in each case,
Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for its direct out-of-pocket costs incurred
in such pursuit.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.25 _Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) Each Party agrees that at any time after the Closing, it
will (i) furnish information, (ii) execute and deliver documents, and (iii)
do any other acts and things, in each case as the other Party may reasonably
require and request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and effecting the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, all at the sole cost and expense of the
requesting Party (unless otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement or an
Ancillary Agreement or the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement with respect to such matter).
Further, in the event that, on or after the Closing, either Party receives
payments or funds due or belonging to the other pursuant to the terms hereof
or any of the Ancillary Agreements, then the Party receiving such payments or
funds shall promptly forward or cause to be promptly forwarded such payments
or funds to the proper party (with appropriate endorsements, as applicable),
and will account to such other Party for all such receipts. The Parties
acknowledge and agree there is no right of offset regarding such payments and
a Party may not withhold funds received from third parties for the account of
the other Party in the event there is a dispute regarding any other issue
under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.25, Seller agrees that Purchaser shall,
following the Closing, have the right and authority to endorse any checks or
drafts received by Purchaser in respect of any account receivable of the
Business included in the Purchased Assets or reflected in the Closing Working
Capital and Seller shall furnish Purchaser such evidence of this authority as
Purchaser may reasonably request.

 



 

Section 5.26 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall cause the audited combined balance sheet of
the Business as of September 25, 2015 and the related audited combined
statements of income and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended (the "
_2015 Financial Statements_ ") to be prepared in a manner consistent with the
preparation of the Financial Statements, and to be delivered to Purchaser
promptly after the 2015 Financial Statements are prepared, and in any event no
later than 45 days after the Closing Date, along with an audit report from
Deloitte and Touche LLP (or another nationally recognized "Big 4" accounting
firm) with respect to such 2015 Financial Statements. Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to request that Deloitte and Touche LLP (or another
nationally recognized "Big 4" accounting firm) issue a consent to enable
Purchaser to include the 2015 Financial Statements in any filings required to
be made by Purchaser with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. Promptly following delivery of the 2015 Financial
Statements to Purchaser, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for one-half of the
fees paid to the accounting firm issuing such audit report with respect to the
preparation of the 2015 Financial Statements and one-half of any related
consent fees.

 



 

(b) Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser, and shall
cause its Affiliates and its and their respective employees and
representatives to reasonably cooperate with Purchaser, with respect to any
financial statements that Purchaser or its Affiliates deem reasonably
necessary in order to make any filing required by applicable Law or stock
exchange requirements, including filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser
such financial statements of the Business as are received by Seller, in each
case promptly following receipt by Seller.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.27 _China Regulatory Approvals_. Seller has engaged DZX
International Appraisal Limited (the " _China Valuation Firm_ "), a valuation
firm duly qualified to conduct such valuation as required by an applicable
Chinese Governmental Authority set forth on _Schedule 3.4_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, to conduct a valuation of the Seller China Legal Entities
in accordance with the principles set forth on _Schedule 5.27_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter; provided, however, that if at any time the China Valuation
Firm shall cease to be so qualified to conduct such valuations, the Parties
shall (subject to dispute resolution by the Accountant) select a mutually
agreeable valuation firm. Seller shall provide the China Valuation Firm with
all information and with such access to Seller's employees, accountants and
other representatives as is reasonably requested by the China Valuation Firm
in order to perform its obligations under the engagement, subject to customary
confidentiality obligations. Seller shall instruct the China Valuation Firm to
complete the engagement and deliver its valuation report, in a form acceptable
for submission in connection with the filings to be submitted to the
applicable local Tax bureau or the other Governmental Authorities listed on
_Schedule 6.1(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter. Each of Seller and
Purchaser shall have the right to ask questions of the China Valuation Firm
with respect to the process and the valuation, and the Parties will reasonably
cooperate to resolve any related disputes. The value finally reported by the
China Valuation Firm as a result of this process is referred to as the "
_Agreed China Valuation_." Seller and Purchaser shall each be responsible for
the payment of fifty percent (50%) of the related engagement fees and
expenses.

 



 

Section 5.28 _Labor Consultations_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate in carrying out applicable provisions of
information to, or consultations, discussions or negotiations with relevant
unions, works councils or other employee representative groups. Seller shall
use its reasonable best efforts to complete, or cause to be completed, prior
to the Closing, and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist
and cooperate with Seller in causing to be completed, all notifications
required by applicable Law to, and all consultations required by applicable
Law with, the employees, employee representatives, work councils, unions,
labor boards and relevant Governmental Authorities concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with respect to the Business Employees.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this
Agreement shall not constitute a binding agreement to sell or purchase
Seller's or any of its Affiliates' right, title and interest in and to the
Purchased Assets or any Conveyed Entity, as applicable, in France. At any time
after the date on which the required information and consultation process(es)
with each union, works council or other employee representative group in
France are complete under applicable Law, Seller may, at its sole option (the
" _Put Option_ "), determine to sell, transfer and assign (or procure that an
Affiliate of Seller, as applicable, shall sell, transfer and assign) to
Purchaser or the relevant Permitted Designee all of Seller's and any of its
Affiliates' right, title and interest in and to the Purchased Assets or
Conveyed Entity, as applicable, in France and, in such event, shall encourage
all Business Employees in France to transfer to or continue employment with
Purchaser or its Affiliates as part of the sale of such Purchased Assets or
such Conveyed Entity, as applicable; _provided_ that nothing herein shall be
interpreted as requiring Seller or any of its Affiliates to provide any
Business Employee with any additional compensation or benefits to incentivize
such Person to transfer to or continue employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliates as part of the sale of such Purchased Assets or such Conveyed
Entity, as applicable. Upon Seller's exercise of the Put Option, the purchase
and sale of the Purchased Assets or Conveyed Entity, as applicable, in France
shall be deemed a part of and undertaken on the same terms and conditions as
the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets under Section 2.2 or, as the
case may be, the purchase and sale of the Conveyed Entities under Section 2.1,
and the transfer of the Business Employees in each such jurisdiction shall be
in accordance with Section 5.5. In case of concerns raised by a union, works
council or other employee representative group in France in connection with
the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets or Conveyed Entity, as
applicable, in France in accordance with this Section 5.28(b), which could
reasonably be addressed by updates, modifications or amendments to this
Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith with respect to
any such updates, modifications or amendments designed to carry out, so far as
possible while addressing such concerns, the intent and purpose of this
Agreement and the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets or Conveyed
Entity, as applicable, in France.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.29 _Data Extraction_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (i) Seller shall maintain all Business Records that remain in its
possession materially in accordance with its standard record retention
policies and procedures and (ii) Seller shall reasonably cooperate, upon
Purchaser's written request and at Purchaser's expense, with Purchaser to
locate and deliver requested Business Records; provided that Seller shall be
under no obligation to deliver to Purchaser any Business Records (other than
physical Business Records accessed by Seller or its Affiliates in the ordinary
course of business) (x) unless Purchaser agrees to pay for Seller's reasonable
expenses in connection with the delivery thereof or (y) except as set forth in
the Transition Services Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.30 _Other Actions_. Seller agrees to be bound by the
obligations set forth on _Schedule 5.30_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 



 

Section 5.31 _Amendments_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Parties agree to negotiate in
good faith an amendment to this Agreement to give effect to certain mechanics
of the Closing consistent with the discussions previously held between the
Parties. Once so negotiated and finalized, the Parties agree to execute such
amendment as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Parties agree to negotiate in good
faith an amendment to this Agreement (i) to implement the Parties'
understanding that the payment of the purchase price for the Shanghai South
Purchase, in the event the Shanghai South Purchase occurs after the Closing,
shall be economically neutral for Purchaser and Seller and (ii) to provide
for, in the event the Shanghai South Purchase occurs after the Closing,
reasonably acceptable mechanics relating to Purchaser's operation of the
Shanghai South Retained Business, from the Closing Date until the occurrence
of the Shanghai South Purchase, for the sole economic benefit and detriment of
Seller. The Parties further agree that such amendment will allow the Purchaser
to retain such cash from the operation of the Shanghai South Retained Business
as will be necessary to pay any Taxes imposed resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, or caused by the operation of such business. In the event Seller
waives the condition set forth in Section 6.3(d), once so negotiated and
finalized, the Parties agree to execute such amendment as soon as reasonably
practicable.

ARTICLE VII 

TAX MATTERS

 



 

Section 7.1 _Allocation of Taxes to Seller_. Seller shall be
responsible for and will pay or cause to be paid any and all of the following
(collectively, " _Seller 's Taxes_"):

 



 

(a) all Taxes imposed on the Conveyed Companies with respect to
all taxable periods of the Conveyed Companies that end on or before the
Closing Date and all Income Taxes imposed on Seller, the Equity Selling
Entities and the Asset Selling Entities, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, Taxes imposed on Seller or any of its Affiliates as a result of the
Restructuring;

 



 

(b) any Taxes relating to the Shanghai South Retained Business,
including without limitation Taxes resulting from, arising out of, relating
to, or caused by the Shanghai South Purchase;

 



 

(c) all Income Taxes imposed on the Conveyed Companies under
any consolidation, combination, fiscal unity, or similar regime by any U.S. or
foreign federal, state or local Tax Law for all taxable periods that end on or
before the Closing Date;

 



 

(d) Seller's portion of the Taxes for any Straddle Period, as
determined under Section 7.3; and

 



 

(e) one-half of all Transfer Taxes;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller's Taxes shall not include (i) any Taxes
arising as a result of actions taken by any Conveyed Company or Purchaser or
any of their Affiliates with respect to any Conveyed Company or Purchased
Asset after the effective time of the Closing or (ii) any liability for non-
Income Taxes, but only to the extent such non-Income Taxes were (x) accrued
and specifically set forth in the Closing Statement and (y) reflected in the
calculation of Final Closing Working Capital.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Allocation of Taxes to Purchaser_. Purchaser shall be
responsible for, will pay or cause to be paid, and will indemnify Seller and
its Affiliates from and against any and all Taxes, including one-half of all
Transfer Taxes, relating to the Conveyed Companies or the Purchased Assets,
other than those allocated to Seller pursuant to Sections 7.1 and 7.3.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes_.

 



 

(a) With respect to any taxable period of a Conveyed Company
relating to Taxes that would (absent an election) include, but not end until
after, the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), Seller may or may cause one
or more of the Conveyed Companies, at its sole option, to elect with any
relevant Taxing Authority to close such Straddle Period as of the Effective
Time. As a result of such election, Taxes will be allocated to Seller, on the
one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, pursuant to the provisions of
Sections 7.1 and 7.3, respectively.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) In any case where the Straddle Period of a Conveyed Company
is not or cannot be closed pursuant to Section 7.3(a), Seller will be
allocated any Income Taxes imposed on the Conveyed Company for the portion of
the Straddle Period up to and including the Closing Date. For purposes of this
Section 7.3(b), Income Taxes for the portion of a Straddle Period up to and
including the Closing Date will be determined based upon an interim closing of
the books of the Conveyed Company as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date based
upon Tax accounting methods, practices and procedures last used by such
Conveyed Company in preparing its Tax Returns.

 



 

(c) As to any Tax other than an Income Tax or a Transfer Tax
for any Straddle Period, Seller will be allocated:

 



 

(i) for any such Tax that is determined based upon specific
transactions (including, but not limited to, value added, sales, and use
Taxes), all such Taxes applicable to transactions that have been consummated
during the period through the end of the Closing Date; and

 



 

(d) for any such Tax that is not based upon specific
transactions (including, but not limited to, license, real property, personal
property, franchise and doing business Taxes), any such Tax equal to the full
amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 7.4(a)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, Seller shall, and shall cause the Equity Selling Entities,
the Asset Selling Entities, and/or the Conveyed Companies to, prepare and
file, or cause to be prepared and filed, within applicable statutory limits
and consistent with prior practice, all Tax Returns of or that include the
Conveyed Companies or the Purchased Assets (including any amendments thereto)
that are due to be filed (giving effect to any extension of time to file) on
or prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall, and shall cause the Equity Selling
Entities and/or the Conveyed Companies to, pay all Taxes shown on such Tax
Returns when due. To the extent that Seller or its Affiliates are required to
file Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes, Seller shall, and shall cause
the Equity Selling Entities, the Asset Selling Entities and the Conveyed
Companies to, permit Purchaser to review and comment on the portion of any Tax
Returns related to the determination of any Transfer Tax, and Seller shall,
and shall cause the Equity Selling Entities, the Asset Selling Entities,
and/or the Conveyed Companies to, make such revisions to such Tax Returns as
are reasonably requested by Purchaser. Purchaser shall pay over to Seller, no
fewer than three (3) Business Days prior to the due date of any such Transfer
Tax Return, an amount of cash sufficient for the payment of any Taxes shown as
due on such Tax Return and for which Purchaser bears responsibility pursuant
to Section 7.2 hereof.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, prepare
and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns relating to the
Conveyed Companies that are due to be filed (giving effect to any extensions
of time to file) after the Closing Date, including Tax Returns for any taxable
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Period_ "). In
preparing such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns, Purchaser shall not, and shall
cause any of its Affiliates not to, make any changes to any position taken in
any prior taxable year (unless required by applicable Law) that would
adversely affect Seller or its Affiliates. Subject to indemnification by
Seller pursuant to this Article VIII, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, pay or cause to be paid, all Taxes with respect to such Tax
Returns when due. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to permit
Seller to review and comment on any Tax Returns of any of the Conveyed
Companies that are filed after the Closing Date pursuant to which Seller is
responsible for Taxes pursuant to Article VII of this Agreement, and Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, make such revisions to such Tax
Returns as are reasonably requested by Seller. Seller shall, and shall cause,
as applicable, the Equity Selling Entities and/or the Asset Selling Entities
to pay over to Purchaser, no fewer than three (3) Business Days prior to the
due date of the applicable Tax Return, an amount of cash sufficient for the
payment of any Taxes required to be shown as due on such Tax Return and for
which Seller bears responsibility pursuant to Article VII of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Purchaser agrees that, to the extent able to do so under
applicable Law and requested to do so by Seller, Purchaser and any of its
relevant Affiliates shall carry back, at Seller's expense, any item of loss,
deduction, or credit of the Conveyed Companies or Purchased Assets
attributable to any taxable period with respect to which Seller is liable for
Taxes pursuant to Article VII hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this Section 7.4(c)or in any other provision of this Agreement shall require
Purchaser or any of its relevant Affiliates to carry back any item of loss,
deduction, or credit with respect to the Conveyed Companies or Purchased
Assets arising from the operation of the Conveyed Companies or the Purchased
Assets for periods following the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Purchaser agrees that, with respect to each Conveyed Company
and any successor thereto:

 



 

(i) except as provided in Section 7.7(c), neither Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates nor any successors thereto will file any claim for
refund of Taxes in respect of (a) any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date, or (b) in the case of a Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date;

 



 

(ii) Purchaser, its Affiliates, and any successors thereto must
make any elections available to them to waive the right to claim in respect of
any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date any carryback with
respect to Taxes arising in (a) any taxable period beginning after the Closing
Date, or (b) in the case of a Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date;

 



 

(iii) Purchaser, its Affiliates, and any successor thereto will
refrain from making any affirmative elections to claim (a) in respect of any
period ending on or before the Closing Date, or (b) in the case of a Straddle
Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, any
carryback in respect of a Tax arising in (x) any period beginning after the
Closing Date, or (y) in the case of a Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date; and

 



 

 



   



 

(iv) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates nor any
successors thereto will file any amended Tax Return in respect of (A) any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, or (B) in the case of a
Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(a) Seller and Purchaser shall provide prompt notice to the
other of any pending or threatened Contest of which it becomes aware related
to Taxes for any taxable period for which it is indemnified by the other Party
hereunder. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known)
describing any asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall be
accompanied by copies of any notice and other documents it has received from
any Taxing Authority in respect of any such matters. If a Party hereto has
knowledge of an asserted Tax liability with respect to a matter for which it
is to be indemnified under Section 7.6 hereof and such Party fails to give the
indemnifying Party prompt notice of such asserted Tax liability, and such
failure to give prompt notice results in a monetary detriment to the
indemnifying Party, then any amount that the indemnifying Party is otherwise
required to pay the indemnified Party pursuant to Section 7.6 hereof shall be
reduced by the amount of such detriment.

 



 

(b) Seller or its designee shall have the right to represent a
Conveyed Company's interests in any Contest relating to a Tax matter arising
with respect to a Pre-Closing Period to the extent such Contest is in
connection with any Taxes for which Seller may be liable pursuant to Article
VII hereof, to employ counsel of its choice at its expense and to control the
conduct of such Contest, including settlement or other disposition thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall have the right, at Purchaser's
own expense, to consult with Seller regarding any such Contest that may affect
a Conveyed Company for any period beginning on or after the Closing Date (a "
_Post-Closing Period_ ") or for any portion of a Straddle Period beginning on
or after the Closing Date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any settlement or
other disposition of any such Contest that may affect a Conveyed Company for
any Post-Closing Period or any portion of a Straddle Period beginning on or
after the Closing Date may only be made with the consent of Purchaser, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. In the case
of a Contest with respect to a Straddle Period, to the extent that Purchaser
unreasonably withholds, delays or conditions consent, Seller's obligation
under Section 7.6(b)(iii) of this Agreement to indemnify Purchaser for any Tax
with respect to such period shall terminate and Purchaser shall reimburse
Seller for the reasonably incurred costs of the Contest. As with all other Tax
disputes under this Agreement, it is understood by the Parties that any
disputes arising under this Section 7.5(b), including, but not limited to,
disputes regarding consent being unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, shall constitute disputes regarding matters in this Article VII
that require the agreement of the Parties within the meaning of Section 7.10
of this Agreement and, therefore, shall be resolved in accordance with Section
7.10 of this Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Purchaser shall have the right to control the conduct of
any Contest relating to a Tax matter of a Conveyed Company arising with
respect to a taxable period ending after the Closing Date and of any Contest
in respect of which Seller has not elected to represent the interests of a
Conveyed Company pursuant to Section 7.5(b); _provided_ , _however_ , that
Seller shall have the right, at Seller's own expense, to consult with
Purchaser regarding any such Contest that may affect a Conveyed Company for
any Pre-Closing Period or for any portion of a Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any settlement or other
disposition of any such Contest that may affect a Conveyed Company for any
Pre-Closing Period or any portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date may only be made with the consent of Seller, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. In the case of a Contest with
respect to a Straddle Period, to the extent that Seller unreasonably
withholds, delays or conditions consent, Purchaser's obligation under Section
7.6(c) of this Agreement to indemnify Seller for any Tax with respect to such
period shall terminate and Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for the reasonably
incurred costs of the Contest. As with all other Tax disputes under this
Agreement, it is understood by the Parties that any disputes arising under
this Section 7.5(c), including, but not limited to, disputes regarding consent
being unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, shall constitute disputes
regarding matters in this Article VII that require the agreement of the
Parties within the meaning of Section 7.10 of this Agreement and, therefore,
shall be resolved in accordance with Section 7.10 of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Seller and Purchaser agree, in each case at no cost to the
other Party, to cooperate with the other and the other's Representatives in a
prompt and timely manner in connection with any Contest. Such cooperation
shall include, but not be limited to, making available to the other Party,
during normal business hours, all books, records, Tax Returns, documents,
files, other information (including working papers and schedules), officers or
employees (without substantial interruption of employment) or other relevant
information necessary or useful in connection with any Contest requiring any
such books, records and files.

 



 

(e) Where there is a dispute with a Taxing Authority regarding
liability for Tax for a Pre-Closing Period and for which Seller has an
indemnification obligation, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the appropriate
Conveyed Company to, as the case may be, at the request of Seller, pay the
amount of the disputed Tax to the Taxing Authority, and Purchaser or the
Conveyed Company shall be reimbursed by Seller in a manner to be agreed upon
by the Parties at such time as Seller makes such request but prior to the time
Purchaser or the appropriate Conveyed Company makes the payment.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) The indemnification provisions set forth in this Section
7.6 are the exclusive remedy for obligations of the Parties arising under this
Agreement that relate to Taxes and Article VIII of this Agreement shall not
apply to such obligations, other than the survival provisions set forth in
Section 8.1.

 



 

(b) Seller shall be liable for, and covenants and agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates from and against, any
and all liabilities incurred by Purchaser or its Affiliates:

 



 

(i) by reason of a breach of the representations contained in
Section 3.15 hereof;

 



 

(ii) by reason of a breach by Seller of any covenant contained
in Article VII hereof; and

 



 

 



   



 

(iii) for Taxes for which Seller bears responsibility pursuant to
Article VII hereof.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall be liable for, and covenants and agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against, any
and all liabilities incurred by any of Seller or its Affiliates:

 



 

(i) by reason of a breach by Purchaser of any covenant
contained in Article VII hereof; and

 



 

(ii) for Taxes for which Purchaser bears responsibility pursuant
to Section 7.2 of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) If a Party (the " _Tax Indemnified Party_ ") determines that
it or any of its Affiliates is or may be entitled to indemnification by
another Party (the " _Tax Indemnifying Party_ ") under Section 7.6(a) or
7.6(b)(iii) hereof, the Tax Indemnified Party will promptly deliver to the Tax
Indemnifying Party a written notice and demand therefor (the " _Tax Notice_ ")
specifying the basis for indemnification and, if known, the amount for which
the Tax Indemnified Party reasonably believes it or any of its Affiliates is
entitled to be indemnified (a " _Tax Claim_ "), together with any supporting
documentation (including, if applicable, any relevant notice from any Taxing
Authority). The Tax Notice must be received by the Tax Indemnifying Party no
later than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the applicable Tax
statute of limitations; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Tax Indemnified
Party does not receive notice from the applicable Taxing Authority (" _Taxing
Authority Notice_ ") that an item exists that could give rise to a Tax Claim
more than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the applicable Tax statute
of limitations, then the Tax Notice must be received by the Tax Indemnifying
Party as promptly as practicable after the Tax Indemnified Party receives the
Taxing Authority Notice (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days
after the Tax Indemnified Party receives the Taxing Authority Notice). If the
Tax Indemnifying Party objects to the Tax Claim in the manner set forth in
Section 7.6(d) hereof or if either the Tax Indemnifying Party or the Tax
Indemnified Party exercises Contest rights as contemplated by Section 7.5(b),
then the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to make an indemnification
payment to the Tax Indemnified Party until there is a determination by the
Accountant or a Final Determination regarding the Tax Claim, as the case may
be. In all other cases, the Tax Indemnifying Party will pay the Tax
Indemnified Party the amount set forth in the Tax Notice, in cash or other
immediately available funds, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Tax
Notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the amount for which the Tax
Indemnified Party reasonably believes it is entitled to be indemnified is not
known at the time of the Tax Notice, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall pay the
amount known to be due and the Tax Indemnified Party will deliver to the Tax
Indemnifying Party a further Tax Notice specifying the unknown amount as soon
as reasonably practicable after such amount is known and payment will then be
made as set forth above.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) The Tax Indemnifying Party may object to the Tax Claim (or
the amount thereof) set forth in any Tax Notice by giving the Tax Indemnified
Party, within thirty (30) days following receipt of such Tax Notice, written
notice setting forth the Tax Indemnifying Party's grounds for so objecting
(the " _Tax Objection Notice_ "). If the Tax Indemnifying Party does not give
the Tax Indemnified Party the Tax Objection Notice within such thirty (30) day
period, the Tax Indemnified Party may exercise any and all of its rights under
applicable Law and this Agreement to collect such amount.

 



 

(f) If the Tax Indemnified Party and the Tax Indemnifying Party
are unable to settle any dispute regarding a Tax Claim within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the Tax Objection Notice, the Tax Indemnified Party and the
Tax Indemnifying Party will, in accordance with Section 7.10, jointly request
the Accountant to resolve the dispute as promptly as possible.

 



 

(g) Failure by the Tax Indemnified Party to promptly deliver to
the Tax Indemnifying Party a Tax Notice in accordance with Section 7.6(d)
hereof will not relieve the Tax Indemnifying Party of any of its obligations
under this Agreement except to the extent the Tax Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

(h) Each of the Parties, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
agrees not to bring any Actions against any other Party or its Affiliates, in
respect of any breaches or alleged breaches of any representation, warranty or
other provision of this Article VII, except pursuant to and subject to the
express provisions of this Section 7.6.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Refunds_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold in
trust for the benefit of Seller all refunds (including interest paid thereon
by a Governmental Authority and any amounts applied against a Tax liability
for other taxable periods) of any Taxes for which Purchaser is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (" _Seller 's Refunds_"), and,
within five (5) Business Days after receipt by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates of any such Seller's Refund, Purchaser or its Affiliate, as
applicable, shall pay over to Seller the amount of such Seller's Refund
without right of set off or counterclaim.

 



 

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold in
trust for the benefit of Purchaser and its Affiliates all refunds (including
interest paid thereon by a Governmental Authority and any amounts applied
against a Tax liability for other taxable periods) of any Taxes for which
Seller is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (" _Purchaser
's Refunds_") and, within five (5) Business Days of receipt by Seller or any
of its Affiliates of any such Purchaser's Refund, Seller or and its Affiliate,
as applicable, shall pay over to Purchaser the amount of Purchaser's Refund
without right of set off or counterclaim.

 



 

(c) Upon the request of Seller, Purchaser will file, or cause a
Conveyed Company or its Affiliate to file, claims for Seller's Refunds, in
such form as Seller may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
filing of any such claim will not result in any prejudice to Purchaser or its
Affiliates. Seller will have the sole right to prosecute any claims for
Seller's Refunds (by suit or otherwise) at Seller's expense and with counsel
of Seller's choice. Purchaser will cooperate, and cause the appropriate
Conveyed Company or Affiliate to cooperate, fully, at Seller's expense, with
Seller and its counsel in connection therewith.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Upon the request of Purchaser, Seller shall and shall cause
its Affiliates to file, claims for Purchaser's Refunds, in such form as
Purchaser may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the filing of
any such claim will not result in any prejudice to Seller or its Affiliates.
Purchaser will have the sole right to prosecute any claims for Purchaser's
Refunds (by suit or otherwise) at Purchaser's expense and with counsel of
Purchaser's choice. Seller will cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to
cooperate, fully, at Purchaser's expense, with Purchaser and its counsel in
connection therewith.

 



 

(e) Except as provided in Sections 7.7(a) and 7.7(b) hereof,
any refunds of Taxes other than Seller's Refunds and Purchaser's Refunds will
be the property of the payee of such refunds and no other Party nor any of its
Affiliates will have any right to such refunds.

 



 

(f) To the extent reasonably requested by Seller, and within
(30) days of such request, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall grant to Seller
appropriate powers of attorney as may reasonably be necessary to prosecute or
defend its rights hereunder.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date,
Seller and Purchaser, in each case of no cost to the other Party, shall
cooperate (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate) with each
other and with each other's agents, including accounting firms and legal
counsel, in connection with Tax matters relating to the Conveyed Companies and
the Purchased Assets, including (i) the preparation and filing of Tax Returns,
(ii) determining the liability for and amount of any Taxes due or the right to
and amount of any refund of Taxes, (iii) examinations of Tax Returns, and (iv)
any administrative or judicial proceedings in respect of Taxes assessed or
proposed to be assessed. Such cooperation shall include making all information
and documents in their possession related to the Business available to the
other, as provided in Section 7.9 hereof. Seller and Purchaser also shall (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to) make available to the other, as
reasonably requested and available, personnel responsible for preparing,
maintaining, and interpreting information and documents relevant to Taxes. Any
information or documents provided under this Section 7.8 shall be kept
confidential by the Party receiving the information or documents, except as
may otherwise be necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in
connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to Taxes.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Tax Records_. Tax records in possession of Seller
(other than those included in the Excluded Assets) and/or the Equity Selling
Entities relating to the Conveyed Companies shall be transferred to Purchaser.
Seller may make and retain copies of such Tax records. Seller, Purchaser, and
their respective Affiliates shall make available to each other (at no cost to
the requesting Party) for inspection and copying during normal business hours
upon reasonable notice all Tax records in their possession relating to the
Conveyed Companies and the Purchased Assets to the extent reasonably required
by the other Party in connection with the preparation of Tax Returns,
resolution of items under this Article VII, or other audits, disputes or
litigation. Seller, Purchaser, and their respective Affiliates shall preserve
and keep such Tax records in their possession until the expiration of any
applicable statutes of limitation and as otherwise required by Law, but in any
event for a period of not less than ten (10) years after the Closing Date.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 7.10 _Dispute Resolution_. If Seller and Purchaser fail to
agree on the resolution of any of the matters in this Article VII that require
the agreement of the Parties or otherwise disagree about the proper
interpretation or operation of any provision of this Article VII, then such
matter shall be referred to the Accountant for binding arbitration. Seller and
Purchaser shall deliver to the Accountant copies of any schedules or
documentation that may reasonably be required by the Accountant to make its
determination. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall be entitled to submit to the
Accountant a memorandum setting forth its position with respect to such
arbitration. The Accountant shall render a determination within sixty (60)
days of the referral of such matter for binding arbitration. Seller or
Purchaser, as the case may be, shall pay to the other Party the amount
determined by the Accountant within ten (10) days of the date on which the
Accountant makes its determination. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Section 7.10, the Accountant may, at its sole discretion, amend the procedures
contained herein. The determination of the Accountant shall be final and
binding on all Parties. The costs incurred in retaining the Accountant shall
be shared equally, fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by
Purchaser.

 



 

Section 7.11 _Payment_. All amounts required to be paid to a Party
under this Article VII shall be paid in Dollars and translated from local
currency at the spot rate. If a Party (the " _Payor_ ") fails to make a
payment due and owing under this Article VII to the other Party or any of its
Affiliates (the " _Payee_ ") within thirty (30) days of the date prescribed by
this Article VII, the Payor will pay to the Payee interest (such interest to
be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days
elapsed) on such payment from and including the date on which such payment was
due, but excluding the day the Payor makes such payment, at a rate equal to
eight percent (8%) per annum.

 



 

Section 7.12 _Termination of Tax Allocation Agreements_. Immediately
prior to the close of business on the Closing Date, (i) all Tax allocation or
sharing agreements or arrangements existing between any of Seller and the
Equity Selling Entities, on the one hand, and any of the Conveyed Companies,
on the other hand, shall be terminated; and (ii) amounts due under such
agreements or arrangements shall be settled prior to the Closing Date in such
manner as Seller shall determine (including capitalization or distribution of
amounts due or receivable under such agreements or arrangements). Upon such
termination and settlement, no further payments by or to the Conveyed
Companies with respect to such agreements or arrangements shall be made, and
all other rights and obligations resulting from such agreements or
arrangements between the Conveyed Companies and others shall cease at such
time.

 



 

Section 7.13 _Adjustment_. All amounts paid, or caused to be paid, by
one Party or its Affiliates to another Party or its Affiliates pursuant to
this Agreement (other than interest in accordance with Section 7.11 hereof,
but including amounts payable under Article VIII hereof) shall be treated by
the Parties as an adjustment to the Aggregate Purchase Price, to the extent
permitted by Law.

Section 8.1 _Survival_.

 



 

(a) The respective representations and warranties of Seller and
Purchaser (other than the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.9 (including the representations and warranties listed in (b)Section 3.9(c)
solely to the extent pertaining to environmental matters) and the Specified
Representations and those in Section 3.15 with respect to Taxes) contained in
this Agreement, and the ability to bring claims for breaches thereof, shall
survive the date hereof until the date that is fifteen (15) months from the
Closing Date, the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.9 (and
the ability to bring claims for breaches thereof) shall survive the date
hereof until the date that is the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date,
the Specified Representations (and the ability to bring claims for breaches
thereof) shall survive indefinitely and the representations and warranties in
Section 3.15 with respect to Taxes (and the ability to bring claims for
breaches thereof) shall survive until the date that is sixty (60) days
following the expiration of the applicable Tax statute of limitations. The
respective covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement
that require performance in full prior to the Closing (and the ability to
bring claims for breaches thereof) shall survive the Closing until the date
that is fifteen (15) months from the Closing Date, and any other respective
covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement (and the
ability to bring claims for breaches thereof) shall survive the Closing
indefinitely, unless earlier terminated in accordance with their express
terms.

 



 

(b) Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall have any liability
whatsoever with respect to any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
unless a claim is made hereunder prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival period for such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, in
which case such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive
as to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved and satisfied. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall limit the rights of the Parties
to seek indemnification for any breach of any covenant or agreement occurring
prior to the applicable survival date.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to the limitations
set forth in this Article VIII, including Section 8.6 hereof, after the
Closing, Seller agrees to defend and indemnify Purchaser and each of its
Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, the Conveyed Companies),
and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, successors and
assigns (the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") and save and hold each of them
harmless against any Losses incurred or suffered by them as a result of or
arising out of: (a) any failure of any representation or warranty made by
Seller contained in Article III (other than Section 3.15 relating to Taxes,
which is addressed by Article VII exclusively) to be true and correct on the
date hereof or as of the Closing Date (except to the extent such
representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier date, in which case
on and as of such earlier date); (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement
by Seller contained in this Agreement (other than covenants contained in
Article VII, which are addressed by Article VII exclusively); or (c) except to
the extent subject to indemnification under Section 8.3, any Retained
Liability (other than Retained Liabilities described in Sections 2.5(a)(vi)
and 2.5(a)(vii), which are addressed by Article VII exclusively).

 



 

 



   



 

Section 8.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article VIII, including Section 8.6 hereof,
after the Closing, Purchaser agrees to defend and indemnify Seller and its
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
successors and assigns (" _Seller Indemnitees_ ") and save and hold each of
them harmless against any Losses incurred by them as a result of or arising
out of: (a) any failure of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser
contained in Article IV to be true and correct on and as of the date hereof or
as of the Closing Date (except to the extent such representation or warranty
expressly relates to an earlier date, in which case on and as of such earlier
date); (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by Purchaser contained in
this Agreement; (c) except to the extent subject to indemnification under
Section 8.2, any Assumed Liability (other than Assumed Liabilities described

to the extent subject to indemnification under Section 8.2, events occurring
on or after the Closing Date in connection with the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Equity Interests, including the use, ownership, possession,
operation or occupancy of any Transferred Owned Real Property, the
Intellectual Property of the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Equity
Interests from and after the Closing Date and (e) any Parent Guarantee, Seller
Surety Bond or Parent LofC that remains outstanding after the Closing (to the
extent arising out of or as a result of the default by Purchaser or its
Affiliates after the Closing).

 



 

Section 8.4 _Limitation on Indemnification, Mitigation_.

 



 

(a) _Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement:

 



 

(i) Except with respect to breaches or inaccuracies of
Specified Representations, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be liable for
any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a) (A)
for any individual item (or series of related items) where the Loss relating
thereto is less than $100,000 (the " _Per-Claim Deductible_ "), and (B) in
respect of each individual item (or series of related items) where the Loss
relating thereto is equal to or greater than the Per-Claim Deductible, unless
and until the aggregate amount of all such indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered from Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, equals or exceeds
$3,500,000, in which case Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall be
liable only for the amount of the Losses in excess of such amount.

 



 

(ii) Except with respect to breaches or inaccuracies of
Specified Representations, the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable
Losses which may be recovered for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)
or Section 8.3(a), as the case may be, shall be an amount equal to
$35,000,000.

 



 

(iii) The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which
may be recovered from Seller for indemnification pursuant to Section
8.2(a)-(b) shall be an amount equal to the Gross Purchase Price. The maximum
amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from Purchaser for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.3(a)-(b) shall be an amount equal to the
Gross Purchase Price.

 



 

 



   



 

(iv) Purchaser shall take and shall cause its controlled
Affiliates to take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon
becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does,
give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent
necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Loss; _provided_ , that
any indemnifiable Losses shall be reduced by the amount of such mitigation,
net of any costs and expenses reasonably incurred in pursuing such mitigation.
Further, the failure to mitigate if required hereby shall not result in the
loss of any indemnification rights but the amount of otherwise indemnifiable
Losses resulting from such matter will be reduced by the amount thereof that
would have been provided had such mitigation occurred.

 



 

(v) With respect to each representation or warranty that is
Qualified (other than the Excepted Representations), no such Qualification
shall be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether an
inaccuracy or breach of such representation or warranty has occurred or the
amount of any Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder (it being
understood that the word "Material" in the definitions of the terms "Material
Contracts" and "Material Permits" shall still be given effect).

 



 

(b) _Mitigation by Seller_. Seller shall take and shall cause
its controlled Affiliates to take all commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be
expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the
minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Loss;
_provided_ , that any indemnifiable Losses shall be reduced by the amount of
such mitigation, net of any costs and expenses reasonably incurred in pursuing
such mitigation. Further, the failure to mitigate if required hereby shall not
result in the loss of any indemnification rights but the amount of otherwise
indemnifiable Losses resulting from such matter will be reduced by the amount
thereof that would have been prevented had such mitigation occurred.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Losses Net of Insurance, Etc._ The amount of any Loss
for which indemnification is provided under Section 7.6, Section 8.2 or
Section 8.3 shall be net of (i) any accruals or reserves included in the
Closing Working Capital, (ii) any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification by, or indemnification
agreement with, any third party, (iii) any insurance proceeds or other cash
receipts or sources of reimbursement actually recovered as an offset against
such Loss (each of the Persons named in clauses (ii) and (iii), a "
_Collateral Source_ ") and (iv) an amount equal to the Tax benefit, if any,
actually realized in cash or a reduction in Taxes otherwise payable, in each
case in a taxable year or period prior to the year in which the
indemnification payment is made and that is attributable to such Loss (in each
case, net of reasonable expenses incurred in procuring such recovery. Each
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery
from all Collateral Sources. If the amount to be netted hereunder in
connection with a Collateral Source from any payment required under Section
7.6, Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 is determined after payment by the
Indemnifying Party of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall
repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any amount
that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this Article
VIII had such determination been made at the time of such payment, and any
such excess recovery shall be applied to reduce any future payments to be made
by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 7.6, Section 8.2 or Section 8.3.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 8.6 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the incurrence of any Losses by any Person
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article VIII (an " _Indemnified Party_
"), including any claim by a third party described in Section 8.7, which might
give rise to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to
the Party from which indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
a certificate (the " _Claim Certificate_ "), which Claim Certificate shall:

 



 

(i) state that the Indemnified Party has paid or anticipates
it will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; and

 



 

(ii) to the extent known, specify in reasonable detail (and have
annexed thereto all material supporting documentation, including any material
correspondence in connection with any Third-Party Claim and paid invoices for
claimed Losses) each individual item of Loss included in the amount so stated,
the date such item was paid or accrued, the basis for any anticipated
liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach
of covenant or claim to which each such item is related and the computation of
the amount to which such Indemnified Party claims to be entitled hereunder;

 



 

 _provided_ , that the failure to provide any such Claim Certificate,
information or documents will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall object to the
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims
specified in any Claim Certificate, the Indemnifying Party shall, within
forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such Claim
Certificate, deliver to the Indemnified Party a notice of objection to such
effect, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such objection, and the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall, within the sixty- (60-)
day period beginning on the date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of such
objection, attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims to which the Indemnifying Party
shall have so objected. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall succeed in reaching agreement on their respective rights with respect to
any of such claims, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
promptly prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth such agreement. Should
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party be unable to agree as to any
particular item or items or amount or amounts within such time period, then
the Indemnified Party shall be permitted to submit such dispute to a court of
competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section 10.11.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Claims for Losses covered by a memorandum of agreement of
the nature described in Section 8.6(b) and claims for Losses the validity and
amount of which have been the subject of judicial determination as described
in Section 8.6(b) or have been settled with the consent of the Indemnifying
Party as described in Section 8.7(b) are hereinafter referred to,
collectively, as " _Agreed Claims_ ". Within ten (10) Business Days of the
determination of the amount of any of the Agreed Claims, the Indemnifying
Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to the Agreed Claim
by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the bank account or
accounts designated by the Indemnified Party in a notice to the Indemnifying
Party not less than two (2) Business Days prior to such payment.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Third-Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) If a claim by a third party is made against any Indemnified
Party with respect to which the Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnification hereunder for any Loss under this Article VIII, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim (
_provided_ that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to any
Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually and materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to give
such notice). If the Indemnifying Party irrevocably (subject to the limits of
Section 8.4) acknowledges its obligations to indemnify and defend the
Indemnified Party against the entirety of a third-party Action (a " _Third-
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party, such Third Party Claim, and the
Indemnifying Party may compromise or settle the same; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified Party advance notice of
any proposed compromise or settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall not
compromise or settle any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
unless such compromise or settlement (i) provides for no relief other than the
payment of monetary damages borne solely by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) does
not include any admission of wrongdoing or violation of Law on the part of any
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates and (iii) includes as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the third-party claimant to all Indemnified Parties
of a release from all Liability in respect thereof; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall only be
entitled to direct the defense (A) for so long as the Indemnifying Party
conducts the defense in an active and diligent manner, (B) if the Third-Party
Claim is not in respect of any matter involving potential criminal liability
and does not seek as a remedy the imposition of an equitable remedy that, if
granted, would be binding upon any Indemnified Party or any of their
Affiliates, (C) if the Third-Party Claim is in respect of an indemnification
claim by any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or any Seller
Indemnitee pursuant to Section 8.3(a) and the majority of the reasonably
anticipated Losses associated with such Third-Party Claim would not reasonably
be anticipated to be borne by the Indemnified Party, (D) if the Indemnified
Party does not have available to it one or more defenses or counterclaims
which are inconsistent with one or more defenses or counterclaims which may be
alleged by the Indemnifying Party and (E) with respect to any matter if the
Indemnified Party shall not have been advised by outside counsel that there
would be an actual conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party with respect to such matter.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) No Indemnified Party may compromise or settle any Third-
Party Claim for which it is seeking indemnification hereunder without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the Indemnifying Party is controlling
the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.7(a), it shall permit
the Indemnified Party to participate in, but not control, the defense of any
such Action through counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _further_ , that (without limiting the
Indemnified Party's ability to assume control of the defense of such Third
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense pursuant to the last sentence
of Section 8.7(a)) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
counsel to represent it, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, if either (i)
the Indemnified Party has available to it one or more defenses or
counterclaims which are inconsistent with one or more defenses or
counterclaims which may be alleged by the Indemnifying Party or (ii) there is
a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to control or conduct the defense
or prosecution of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party nevertheless
shall have the right to participate in the defense or prosecution of any
Third-Party Claim and, at its own expense, to employ counsel of its own
choosing for such purpose. An Indemnifying Party will lose any previously
acquired right to control the defense of any Third-Party Claim if for any
reason the Indemnifying Party ceases (after notice and reasonable opportunity
to cure) to actively, competently and diligently conduct the defense or
otherwise fails to continue to have the right to control such defense as
described in Section 8.7(a).

 



 

(c) The Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
of any Third-Party Claim, with such cooperation to include (i) the retention
and the provision of the Indemnifying Party records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and (ii) the making available
of employees on a mutually convenient basis for providing additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Environmental Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Article VIII, with respect to any claim for
indemnification hereunder for any breach of Section 3.9 (collectively, "
_Environmental Matters_ "), the parties agree on behalf of themselves and
their respective Affiliates that, in addition to the provisions set forth in
Article VIII (and in the case of any conflict between the provisions of this
Section 8.8 and any other provision in Article VIII, the provisions of this
Section 8.8 shall prevail and apply):

 



 

(a) Seller shall have no liability under this Agreement for any
Losses arising out of or resulting from any testing, sampling, other invasive
investigation of, or Remedial Action relating to, the air, soil, soil gas,
surface water, groundwater, sediment, building materials or other
environmental media or any disclosure, report or communication to, or
initiation or encouragement of any action by, any Governmental Authority or
other third party (each of the foregoing, an "Investigative Action") relating
to any Environmental Matter unless (A) such Investigative Action is reasonably
necessary to respond to a Third-Party Claim, (B) such Investigative Action is
reasonably necessary to respond to an imminent and substantial threat to human
health or safety, (C) Purchaser is required by an Environmental Law to
undertake such Investigative Action or (D) such Investigative Action taken by
Purchaser or an Affiliate is (i) undertaken for a primary purpose other than
seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII and (ii) reasonably
related to such purpose.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Any obligation of Seller to indemnify a Purchaser Indemnitee
(including as of the Closing, the Conveyed Companies) for any Environmental
Matter shall be limited to, and its obligations under this Agreement shall be
satisfied upon achievement of, in a reasonably cost-effective manner, the
minimum standards required to be met, based on the use of the relevant
property as of the Closing Date (or any subsequent use expressly contemplated
by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement), by applicable Environmental
Laws as in effect at the time such Environmental Matter is addressed or by any
Order or requirement of a Governmental Authority. Both parties expressly agree
that such minimum standards may include risk-based clean-up remedies and
standards and/or the imposition of engineering or institutional controls such
as deed or other use restrictions, in each case so long as acceptable to the
relevant Governmental Authorities.

 



 

(c) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not unreasonably
interfere with or disturb the performance by Seller and its representatives in
connection with its defense or control of any Environmental Matter it is
entitled to defend or control pursuant to this Article VIII. In connection
with any such Environmental Matter which Seller is defending or controlling,
on the one hand, or which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is defending or
controlling, on the other (as the case may be, the "Controlling Party"), the
Controlling Party shall (i) keep the other party reasonably informed on a
prompt basis relating to the progress of such Environmental Matter (including
consulting with the other party with respect to strategies and communications
with Governmental Authorities, providing the other party with drafts of all
materials to be submitted to Governmental Authorities and a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such drafts, reasonably considering the
other party's comments on such materials, and permitting the other party to
attend material meetings with any Governmental Authority with respect to such
matter); (ii) diligently and promptly pursue the resolution thereof; (iii) not
interfere with the continuing use of such relevant property, except to the
extent required in order to perform the required actions; (iv) promptly
provide the other party with copies of any non-privileged reports, data,
notices and other documentation related to such Environmental Matter; (v)
reasonably consult with the other party with respect to such Environmental
Matter; and (vi) indemnify the other party for all Losses to the extent shown
to have been caused by any Remedial Action at a Purchased Asset undertaken by
the Controlling Party or its representatives in respect of such Environmental
Matter. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit a Party having a reporting
obligation pursuant to any applicable Law from fulfilling such obligation;
_provided_ , that if either party has any such obligation which affects an
Environmental Matter which the other party is defending or controlling, such
party shall, to the extent practicable, promptly notify the Controlling Party
of such requirement and the content and timing of any reporting and the
parties shall cooperate in satisfying such requirement. For the sake of
clarification, nothing in this Section 8.8(c) is intended to supersede or
abrogate the provisions of Section 8.7.

 



 

(d) Subject to Section 8.8(a), but notwithstanding anything else
herein to the contrary, Seller shall have no liability under this Agreement
for any Losses relating to any Environmental Matter to the extent arising from
or relating to the coming into force of, or the change in, any requirement or
obligation set forth in any Environmental Law or Permit required by
Environmental Law (or the interpretation or enforcement of such Environmental
Law or Permit), including any new or modified standard or requirement for
Remedial Action) on or after Closing.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 8.9 _Sole Remedy/Waiver_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that, in the event that the Closing occurs:

 



 

(a) the sole and exclusive remedy of any Purchaser Indemnitee
with respect to any and all Losses arising in connection with the Business,
the Purchased Assets, the Conveyed Entities or otherwise in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby will be pursuant to the indemnification
obligations set forth in Section 7.6 and Section 8.2; and

 



 

(b) the sole and exclusive remedy of any Seller Indemnitee with
respect to any and all Losses arising in connection with the Business, the
Purchased Assets, the Conveyed Entities or otherwise in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby will be pursuant to the indemnification
obligations set forth in Section 7.6 and Section 8.3.

 



 

In furtherance of the foregoing, the Parties hereby waive, effective upon the
occurrence of the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
any and all other rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of
contribution, if any, and claims for rescission) known or unknown, foreseen or
unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may have against
Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives, any member of the board of
directors of any Conveyed Company, or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives, as the case may be, arising under or based upon any Law
(including any Environmental Law or arising under or based upon any securities
Law, common law or otherwise) for any misrepresentation or breach of the
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, except with respect to
claims of fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, nothing in
this Agreement shall limit or be construed to limit (i) any Person's rights or
remedies in the event of fraud, willful breach or intentional
misrepresentation, as to which such Person shall have all remedies available
at Law or in equity (ii) limit any right of any Person to seek and obtain
equitable relief (including specific performance or injunctive relief) in
accordance with, and subject to, Section 10.17 or (iii) limit any Person's
rights or remedies under the Ancillary Agreements other than this Agreement.

Section 10.2 _Joinder_. At the Closing and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, each Conveyed Company and each applicable Permitted Designee
shall execute a joinder to this Agreement (in a form reasonably agreed between
Purchaser and Seller) pursuant to which such Conveyed Company or Permitted
Designee will assume, and will be obligated with Purchaser and each other on a
joint and several basis, to perform and satisfy each of Purchaser's
obligations under this Agreement. At the Closing and to the extent required

each other on a joint and several basis, to perform and satisfy each of

Section 10.3 _Amendment; Waiver_. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in
the case of an amendment, by Purchaser and Seller or, in the case of a waiver,
by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay
by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 10.4 _Assignment_. No Party to this Agreement may assign any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may assign
its rights or obligations hereunder to any one or more Permitted Designee(s)
(including (a) the right to acquire all or part of the Purchased Assets and/or
Equity Interests or (b) assume all or part of the Assumed Liabilities, as the
case may be, in which event all references herein to Purchaser will be deemed
to refer to Purchaser and/or such Permitted Designee(s)), in such combinations
as appropriate; _provided_ , _further_ , that if such an assignment by
Purchaser to any one or more Permitted Designee(s) would not be permitted by
applicable local Law, then Purchaser and any one or more Permitted Designee(s)
may enter into, and upon request by Purchaser the Seller shall join as a party
to, a novation or similar agreement required by local Law or custom to
transfer its rights or obligations hereunder to any one or more Permitted
Designee(s) (including (a) the right to acquire all or part of the Purchased
Assets and/or Equity Interests or (b) assume all or part of the Assumed
Liabilities, as the case may be, in which event all references herein to
Purchaser will be deemed to refer to Purchaser and/or such Permitted
Designee(s)), in such combinations as appropriate. Any obligation of any Party
to any other Party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed,
satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such Party, shall be deemed to have
been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such Party. Contemporaneously with
the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser is (i) assigning the right to
acquire the Conveyed Entities set forth on Schedule 10.4(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, and the related obligations, to Littelfuse Semiconductor
(Wuxi) Co. Ltd., and (ii) assigning the right to acquire all of the remaining
Conveyed Entities and all Purchased Assets (other than the Purchased Assets
set forth on Schedule 10.4(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter and the
Purchased Assets which are assets of a Conveyed Company), and the related
obligations, to Littelfuse Netherlands CV, in each case with the further right
of assignment as if such Permitted Designee were vested with all rights of
Purchaser for such purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
assignment of Purchaser's obligations hereunder, Purchaser shall remain liable
for all of its and its Affiliates' obligations arising under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all
Schedules and Exhibits, the Purchaser Disclosure Letter and the Seller
Disclosure Letter) contains the entire agreement between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters except for (i)
the Confidentiality Agreement which will remain in full force and effect for
the term provided for therein if this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Article IX and (ii) any written agreement of the Parties that expressly
provides that it is not superseded by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any Person other than Purchaser, Seller or their successors or
permitted assigns any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement,
except the Conveyed Company Covered Persons shall be third-party beneficiaries
of the obligations of Purchaser set forth in Section 5.15 and any Affiliates
of Seller that have provided Parent Guarantees shall be third-party
beneficiaries of the obligations of Purchaser set forth in Section 5.16.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Public Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, each of Purchaser and Seller agrees that, except as may be
required to comply with the requirements of any applicable Laws and the rules
and regulations of each stock exchange upon which the securities of such Party
is listed, if any, no press release or similar public announcement or
communication shall be made concerning the execution or performance of this
Agreement unless the Parties shall have consulted in advance with respect
thereto. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts (a) to develop
a joint communications plan and (b) to ensure that all press releases and
other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be consistent with such joint communications plan. Without limiting the
foregoing, Seller shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with
Purchaser regarding the form and content of any public disclosure of any
material developments or matters involving the Business (including its
financial condition or results of operations), Purchased Assets, Assumed
Liabilities or the Conveyed Companies, including earnings releases, reasonably
in advance of publication or release, and shall give good faith consideration
to Purchaser's comments.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 10.8 _Return of Information_. If for any reason whatsoever the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, each Party
shall promptly return to the other Party all books and records furnished by
such Party or any of its respective Affiliates, agents, employees, or
representatives (including all copies, summaries and abstracts, if any,
thereof) in accordance with the terms, and subject to the exceptions, of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the Party incurring
such costs and expenses; _provided_ that, except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, any costs and expenses of the Conveyed Companies
incurred in connection with this Agreement (and the Ancillary Agreements and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby) up to and including the
Closing shall be borne by, and paid by, Seller.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Disclosure of Certain Matters; Disclosure Letters_. Seller
shall give prompt written notice to Purchaser of (a) any written notice
received by Seller subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing of (or other written communication relating to), any material default
under any Material Contract, (b) the occurrence of any material default under
any Material Contract of which Seller has Knowledge and (c) any written notice
or other written communication from any third party alleging that the consent
of such third party is required in connection with the Transactions. The
disclosure of any matter in any Schedule of the Seller Disclosure Letter or
the Purchaser Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be a disclosure for any
other Schedule of the Seller Disclosure Letter or Purchaser Disclosure Letter,
as applicable, to the extent its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face,
but shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by the disclosing
Party, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material for the
purposes of this Agreement. No disclosure hereunder or supplement to either
the Seller Disclosure Letter or the Purchaser Disclosure Letter from and after
the execution of this Agreement will be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty made in this Agreement for any purposes of this
Agreement, including for purposes of the indemnification provided for in
Section 7.6 and Article VIII or for purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in Article VI have been satisfied.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial;
Limitation of Liability_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflicts of law principles of such state.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) With respect to any Action, each Party irrevocably (i)
agrees and consents to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware or any Delaware State court
and (ii) waives (x) any objection which it may have at any time to the laying
of venue of any Action brought in any such court, (y) any claim that such
Action has been brought in an inconvenient forum and (z) the right to object,
with respect to such Action, that such court does not have any jurisdiction
over such Party. The foregoing consent to jurisdiction shall not constitute
general consent to service of process in the State of Delaware for any purpose
except as provided above and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any
Person other than the respective Parties to this Agreement. Each of Seller and
Purchaser irrevocably agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by United States registered mail to such Party's address set forth in
Article X shall be effective service of process for any Action in Delaware
with respect to any matters for which it has submitted to jurisdiction
pursuant to this Section 10.11. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not
bring or support any Action described in this Section 10.11 other than in the
courts as described above.

 



 

(c) EACH OF PURCHASER AND SELLER HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION AS BETWEEN THE PARTIES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR DISPUTES RELATING HERETO. EACH OF PURCHASER AND SELLER
(I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION Section 10.1110.11(c).

 



 

(d) The Parties agree that the prevailing party or parties, as
the case may be, in any Action shall be entitled to reimbursement of all costs
of litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees, from the non-prevailing
party. For purposes of this Section 10.11(d) each of the "prevailing party"
and the "non-prevailing party" in any Action shall be the party designated as
such by the court or other appropriate official presiding over such Action,
such determination to be made as a part of the judgment rendered thereby.

 



 

(e) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO
THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE
FOR ANY PUNITIVE DAMAGES (OTHER THAN AS MAY BE PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES) OR
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR DAMAGES
BASED UPON ANY MULTIPLE OF LOST EARNINGS (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF
REVENUE, LOST SALES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE) (IN EACH CASE, OTHER THAN AS ARE
REASONABLY FORSEEABLE OR AS MAY BE PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES) IN CONNECTION
WITH ANY CLAIMS, LOSSES, DAMAGES OR INJURIES ARISING OUT OF THE CONDUCT OF
SUCH PARTY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE NONPERFORMING
PARTY WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR NOT.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 10.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
constitute one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Party, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same
counterpart.

 



 

Section 10.13 _Headings_ . The heading references herein and the table of
contents hereto are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of
this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the
provisions hereof.

 



 

Section 10.14 _No Strict Construction_. The Parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event any
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as if drafted jointly by all Parties and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.15 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If
any term or other provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to
any Person or any circumstance, is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, (a) a
suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

Section 10.16 _Release_.

 



 

(a) Except in the case of fraud, effective as of the Closing
Date, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including the
Conveyed Companies), heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, with Purchaser, the " _Purchaser Releasors_ "), hereby
releases, acquits and forever discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, each of Seller, the stockholders of Seller and each of their respective
past, present or future officers, managers, directors, stockholders, partners,
members, Affiliates, employees, counsel and agents (each, a " _Purchaser
Releasee_ ") of, from and against any and all Actions, causes of action,
demands, damages, judgments, debts, dues and suits of every kind, nature and
description whatsoever, in law or in equity, which such Purchaser Releasor or
its heirs, legal representatives, successors or assigns ever had, now has or
may in the future have on or by reason of any matter, cause or thing
whatsoever related to the Business, Purchased Assets, Excluded Assets, Assumed
Liabilities, Retained Liabilities or Conveyed Companies prior to the Closing
Date (other than Assumed Intercompany Payables and Assumed Intercompany
Receivables) (a " _Purchaser Released Claim_ "). Purchaser covenants and
agrees that no Purchaser Releasor shall, nor shall any Purchaser Releasor
cause its respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries to, assert any Purchaser
Released Claim against any Purchaser Releasee. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Section 10.16(a) to the contrary, the release set forth in
this Section 10.16(a) shall not affect or release the obligations of Seller
and its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement entered
into pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including the Ancillary
