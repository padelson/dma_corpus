<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(i)&nbsp;The Buyer, at its own expense, shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or
cause to be filed) when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to
any Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date and all Tax Returns with respect to a Straddle Period. Buyer will provide a copy of
each such Tax Return (with copies of any supporting schedules, workpapers and other relevant
documentation) and, in the case of a Tax Return for a Straddle Period, a statement setting forth
the amount of Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period (with copies of any supporting
schedules, workpapers and other relevant documentation), to the Sellers&#146; Representative, in the
case of an income Tax Return, no later than 60&nbsp;days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is
due, and in the case of a non-Income Tax Return, no later than 15&nbsp;days prior to the date on which
such Tax Return is due, and the Sellers&#146; Representative will advise Buyer in writing of any
proposed change to such Tax Return (a &#147;<U>Buyer&#146;s Change</U>&#148;, in the case of an Income Tax
Return, not less than 30&nbsp;days prior to its due date, and in the case of a non-Income Tax Return,
not less than 5&nbsp;days prior to its due date. Buyer shall, in preparing such Tax Return, cause the
items for which Sellers may be liable hereunder to be reflected in accordance with the
instructions provided by Sellers&#146; Representative unless, in the opinion of a nationally
recognized law firm or accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and the Sellers&#146;
Representative (the &#147;<U>Tax Opinion Firm</U>&#148;), complying with the instructions provided by
Sellers&#146; Representative would result in Buyer taking a position on such Tax Return that does not
satisfy the &#147;more likely than not&#148; requirement.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(ii)&nbsp;If Buyer decides to seek a Tax opinion in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;7.1(a)(i)</U>,
Buyer shall act promptly and in good faith to obtain such an opinion. In the event the Tax
Opinion Firm is unable to issue its Tax opinion before the due date for filing such Tax Return,
the Buyer may timely file such Tax Return without making the disputed Buyer Change. In the event
the Tax opinion, when issued by the Tax Opinion Firm, necessitates that a Tax Return filed in
accordance with the previous sentence be amended, Buyer shall cause such amended Tax Return to be
filed promptly after such resolution that incorporates the conclusion expressed in such opinion.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(iii)&nbsp;For purposes of <U>Section&nbsp;7.1(a)(i)</U>, a position satisfies the &#147;more likely than
not&#148; requirement if such position would more likely than not be affirmed by a court of competent
jurisdiction if such position were to be challenged and disallowed by the applicable Taxing
Authority. The fees and other costs incurred by Buyer in connection with such opinion shall be
borne by Buyer unless the Tax Opinion Firm opines that the instructions provided by Sellers&#146;
Representative would result in Buyer taking a position that does not satisfy the &#147;more likely
than not&#148; requirement, in which event such fees and costs shall be borne by the Sellers&#146;
Representative.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(b)&nbsp;<B>Cooperation</B>. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit examinations, and
any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the Tax liabilities imposed on the Company
or any Subsidiary for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on
the other hand, shall cooperate fully with each other, including, without limitation, the
furnishing or making available during normal business hours of records, personnel (as reasonably
required), books of account, powers of attorney or other materials necessary or helpful for the
preparation of such Tax Returns, the conduct of audit examinations or the defense of claims by
Taxing Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes. The Buyer shall and shall cause the Companies to
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to any Company relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or the Sellers&#146; Representative, any extension
thereof) for the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority. The Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall, upon
request, use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from
any Governmental Body or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions). The Sellers will deliver to Buyer within 20 Business Days of Buyer&#146;s request any
information required to be reported by the Buyer, the Companies or any Affiliate of the foregoing
under Section&nbsp;6043A of the Code.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(c)&nbsp;<B>Payment of Pre-Closing Taxes</B>. The Buyer shall provide written notice to the Sellers&#146;
Representative of the amount of any Taxes for which the Sellers are liable under <U>Section
11.1(b)</U> of this Agreement with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and any Pre-Closing
Straddle Period, together with copies of any relevant schedules, workpapers and other relevant
documentation to establish the amount of such Taxes. The Sellers&#146; Representative, on behalf of the
Sellers, shall pay to the applicable Company the amount of Taxes, if any, for which the Sellers are
liable at least two Business Days prior to the date on which the Tax Returns for the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and for the Straddle Period are due to be filed with the relevant Taxing Authority;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Sellers&#146; Representative shall not be required to pay
any Tax earlier than ten Business Days after its receipt of such written notice. In the event
Buyer disagrees with a Buyer Change and submits the issue to a Tax Opinion Firm in accordance with
<U>Section&nbsp;7.1(a)(i)</U>, the amount of Tax payable by the Sellers&#146; Representative to Buyer shall
be calculated on the assumption that the Buyer&#146;s Change is correct. The Buyer shall promptly
provide the Sellers&#146; Representative a copy of any opinion issued by the Tax Opinion Firm, together
with revised schedules, workpapers and other relevant documents establishing the additional amount
of Taxes, if any, which are payable by the Sellers&#146; Representative; such additional Taxes, if any,
shall be paid by the Sellers&#146; Representative within ten Business Days after receipt of such written
information.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(d)&nbsp;<B>Straddle Period Allocation</B>. For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of any Tax
payable with respect to a Straddle Period will be allocated between the period of the Straddle
Period that extends before the Closing Date through the Closing Date (the &#147;<U>Pre-Closing Straddle
Period</U>&#148;) and the period of the Straddle Period that extends from the day after the Closing Date
to the end of the Straddle Period (the &#147;<U>Post-Closing Straddle Period</U>&#148;) in accordance with
this <U>Section&nbsp;7.4(d)</U>. The portion of such Tax allocable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period
shall (i)&nbsp;in the case of any Taxes other than sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, employment
taxes, withholding taxes and any Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned
during a Straddle Period, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period, and (ii)&nbsp;in the case of any
sales or uses taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes and any Tax based on or
measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on and included the Closing Date. To
the extent that any Tax for a Straddle Period is based on the greater of a Tax on net income, on
the one hand, and a Tax measured by net worth or some other basis not otherwise measured by income,
on the other, the portion of such Tax related to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period will be deemed to
be (1)&nbsp;if the amount of such Tax for the Straddle Period is measured by net worth or other basis,
the amount of such Tax determined as though the taxable values for the entire Straddle Period equal
the respective values as of the Closing Date and multiplying the amount of such Tax by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period or (2)&nbsp;if
the amount of such Tax for the Straddle Period is measured by net income, the amount of such Tax
determined as though the applicable Tax period terminated at the end of the day on the Closing
Date. In the case of a Tax that is (a)&nbsp;paid for the privilege of doing business during a period (a
&#147;<U>Privilege Period</U>&#148;) and (b)&nbsp;computed based on business activity occurring during an
accounting period ending prior to the Privilege Period, any reference to a &#147;Tax period,&#148; a &#147;tax
period&#148; or a &#147;taxable period&#148; shall mean such accounting period and not the Privilege Period. With
respect to real property Taxes and personal property Taxes described in (i)&nbsp;above, the allocation
shall be made on the basis of the most recent officially certified Tax valuation and assessment for
the real property or the personal property, as the case may be. If such valuation pertains to a tax
period other than that in which the Closing Date occurs, such apportionment will be recalculated at
such time as actual Tax bills for such period are available, and the parties will cooperate with
each other in all respects in connection with such recalculation and pay any sums due in
consequence thereof to the party entitled to recover the same within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after the
issuance of such actual Tax bills. The portion of Tax attributable to a Post-Closing Straddle
Period will be calculated in a corresponding manner.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(e)&nbsp;<B>Tax Matters</B>. Whenever any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment, or
otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which the Sellers may be liable under this Agreement,
the Buyer shall, within ten (10)&nbsp;days after receipt of such assertion, inform the Sellers&#146;
Representative in writing (&#147;<U>Tax Notice</U>&#148;). The Tax Notice must describe such assertion in
reasonable detail and must indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary and to the extent feasible)
of the Adverse Consequence that has been or may be suffered by the Sellers and the Sellers&#146;
Representative. The Buyer&#146;s failure to give a Tax Notice the Sellers&#146; Representative within such
ten (10)&nbsp;day period will not relieve the Sellers&#146; Representative of any Liability that it may have
to the Buyer, except to the extent that the Sellers&#146; Representative demonstrates that the
resolution of such claim is prejudiced by the Buyer&#146;s failure to give such notice.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(i) <B>Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Matter</B>. The Sellers&#146; Representative has the right to
represent the interests of the Companies before the relevant Taxing Authority with respect to any
audit, claim or contest relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a &#147;<U>Pre-Closing Tax Matter</U>&#148;)
and has the right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any such Pre-Closing
Tax Matter, including responding to inquiries, filing Tax Returns and contesting, defending
against and resolving any assessment for additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other
adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, such Pre-Closing Tax Matter. The Buyer has the right
(but not the duty) to participate in the defense of such Pre-Closing Tax Matter and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from counsel employed by the Sellers&#146; Representative. The
Sellers&#146; Representative shall not enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any such
Pre-Closing Tax Matter to the extent that it adversely affects the Tax liability of the Buyer
without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(ii) <B>Straddle Period Tax Matter</B>. The Buyer has the right to represent the interests of the
Companies before the relevant Taxing Authority with respect to any audit, claim or contest
relating to a Straddle Period (a &#147;<U>Straddle Period Tax Matter</U>&#148;) and has the right to
control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any such Straddle Period Tax Matter,
including responding to inquiries, filing Tax Returns and contesting, defending against and
resolving any assessment for additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of
Taxes of, or relating to, such Straddle Period Tax Matter. If the Sellers would be required to
indemnify the Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;11.1(b)</U>
of this Agreement with respect to such Straddle Period Tax Matter then: (A)&nbsp;the Sellers have the
right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense of such Straddle Period Tax Matter and to
employ counsel, at their own expense, separate from counsel employed by the Buyer, and (B)&nbsp;the
Buyer shall not enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Straddle Period Tax
Matter to the extent that it adversely affects the Tax liability of the Sellers without the prior
written consent of the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(f)&nbsp;<B>Transfer Taxes</B>. All transfer, excise, franchise, property, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connect ion with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(&#147;<U>Transfer Taxes</U>&#148;) will be borne one-half by the Sellers, on the one hand, and one-half by
Buyer, on the other hand, when due. All necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to Transfer Taxes will be prepared and filed by the party required to file such Tax Returns under
applicable Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(g)&nbsp;<B>Post-Closing Consolidated Tax Return</B>. The Buyer shall elect to file a consolidated U.S.
federal income Tax Return with Techni-Core and MPC for the taxable year of Buyer that includes the
day after the Closing Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(h)&nbsp;<B>Closing of the Tax Year</B>. The parties acknowledge and agree that, as a consequence of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (i)&nbsp;the taxable year of Techni-Core and MPC shall close for U.S.
federal income tax purposes at the end of the day on the Closing Date, (ii)&nbsp;to the extent
applicable Law in other taxing jurisdictions so permits, the taxable year of Techni-Core and MPC
shall close at the end of the day on the Closing Date, and (iii)&nbsp;all federal, state, local and
foreign Income Tax Returns of Techni-Core and MPC shall be filed on the foregoing basis.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(i)&nbsp;<B>Closing Date Transactions</B>. Each Company shall report all transactions not in the Ordinary
Course of Business, which occur on the Closing Date and after the Closing, on the consolidated U.S.
federal Income Tax Return of such Company and Buyer for the Post-Closing Period to the extent
permitted by Treasury Regulation &#167;1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (and to the extent permitted or required
under comparable provisions of state, local and foreign Tax law).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(j)&nbsp;<B>Amendment of Tax Returns</B>. Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates, nor any Company,
shall amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return of any Company with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of the Sellers&#146; Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.
Except with respect to amendments required by Law, the Sellers&#146; Representative may withhold its
consent in its sole and absolute discretion if it reasonably determines that such amendment,
refiling, revocation, or other modification may (i)&nbsp;increase the income or gain, or decrease the
deductions, losses or credits, of a Company for a taxable period or portion thereof ending on or
prior to the Closing Date, or (ii)&nbsp;increase the indemnification obligation of any Seller under this
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(k)&nbsp;<B>Refunds or Credits</B>. To the extent not specifically identified as an asset in Final Net
Working Capital, the Buyer shall within 10 Business Days pay to the Sellers&#146; Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) any refunds or credits of Taxes attributable to any Company that relate to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Pre-Closing Straddle Period as follows: (i)&nbsp;in the case of a refund,
when such refund is actually received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, any of the
Companies), and (ii)&nbsp;in the case of a credit, when such credit is applied against, credited to, or
used to offset Taxes or other amounts owed or otherwise payable by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including any of the Companies); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, to the extent such refund or
credit of Taxes is attributable (i)&nbsp;a Buyer Tax Act, such refunds or credits shall be for the
account of the Buyer, and (ii)&nbsp;to a net operating loss or other Tax attribute of the Buyer, any
Company, or any Affiliate of the foregoing generated in or otherwise attributable to either a
taxable period beginning after the Closing Date or the Post-Closing Straddle Period, such refunds
and credits shall be for the account of the Buyer if the carryback of such loss or other Tax
attribute was permitted under this Agreement. The Buyer shall be entitled to all other refunds and
credits of Taxes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(l)&nbsp;<B>Tax Sharing Agreements</B>. All Tax allocation agreements, Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving any Company will be terminated as of the Closing Date and,
after the Closing Date, no Company will be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder, other
than such allocation, sharing and similar agreements entered into by one or more Companies with a
third party that is not a Taxing Authority.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(m)&nbsp;<B>Post Closing Tax Obligations</B>. Buyer shall be responsible for all Taxes incurred by or
with respect to each of the Companies, whether resulting from the assets or operations of the
Companies or otherwise, for all taxable periods or portions thereof beginning after the Closing
Date, including the Post-Closing Straddle Period. In the event the Sellers or the Sellers&#146;
Representative pays any such Taxes after the Closing Date, Buyer shall reimburse the Sellers&#146;
Representative therefor within two Business Days after the date on which the Taxes are paid.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(n)&nbsp;<B>Other Tax Matters</B>.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(i)&nbsp;None of Buyer, the Companies, or any of their Affiliates shall make any election under
Code Section&nbsp;338 (or any comparable provision of state, local or foreign law) with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(ii)&nbsp;Unless otherwise required by applicable Law or expressly permitted under this
Agreement, no party or any of its Affiliates shall make or change any Tax election, amend any Tax
Return, take any action or enter into any transaction, in each case after the Closing, that
results in any increased Tax liability of any other party, or that increases the indemnification
obligation of any other party or any other party&#146;s Affiliates under this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(o)&nbsp;<B>Certain Post-Closing Settlement Payments</B>. If the examination of, or amendment or other
adjustment to, a Tax Return of a Company for a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date results (by settlement, assessment, or otherwise) in any adjustment which
permits Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including a Company) to increase the amount of deductions,
losses or Tax credits, or to decrease the amount of income, gains or the recapture of Tax credits,
which would otherwise (but for such adjustments) have been reported or taken into account
(including by way of any increase in basis) by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including a Company)
for one or more periods ending after the Closing Date (a &#147;<U>Post-Closing Tax Adjustment</U>&#148;),
Buyer shall promptly (i)&nbsp;notify the Sellers&#146; Representative of such Post-Closing Tax Adjustment,
and (ii)&nbsp;pay to the Sellers&#146; Representative the Tax Benefit attributable to such Post-Closing
Adjustment within ten Business Days.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(p)&nbsp;<B>Certain Pre-Closing Adjustments</B>.&nbsp; If Buyer determines that an adjustment to a previously
filed Tax Return of a Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period would result in an adjustment which
would permit a Company to increase the amount of deductions, losses or Tax credits, or to decrease
the amount of income or gains than had been reported on such Tax Return (a &#147;<U>Pre-Closing Tax
Adjustment</U>&#148;), Buyer shall (i)&nbsp;notify the Sellers&#146; Representative of such Pre-Closing Tax
Adjustment and (ii)&nbsp;obtain the prior written consent of the Sellers&#146; Representative, such consent
to be granted or withheld in accordance with the standards set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;7.1(j)</U>.&nbsp; If
Seller&#146;s Representative consents to such Pre-Closing Tax Adjustment to the Tax Return, the
Sellers&#146; Representative shall pay to Buyer within 10 Business Days an amount equal to 25% of any
refunds or credits of Taxes actually received by the Company, but only if and to the extent such
refund or credit is attributable to such Pre-Closing Tax Adjustment. In computing the amount of
any such Tax benefits, the Company shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit with respect to such taxable year (including any other adjustments that
may be made, whether required by Law or otherwise) before recognizing any items related to such
Pre-Closing Tax Adjustment and shall be deemed to have paid the amount of Taxes owed with respect
to any other adjustments (whether required by Law or otherwise) in computing the amount of the
refund or credit attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Adjustment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
such adjustment is required by Law, or is accepted by a Taxing Authority in connection with a
Pre-Closing Tax Matter or a Straddle Period Tax Matter, then any resultant refunds or credits of
Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall be paid in full by Buyer
to the Sellers&#146; Representative within ten Business Days, and the Buyer shall not be entitled to
receive or retain 25% of any such Tax refund or credit.

indemnity pending on any Expiration Date for which a Claim Notice has been given in accordance with
<U>Section&nbsp;11.4</U> on or before such Expiration Date may continue to be asserted and indemnified
against until finally resolved.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(b)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this <U>Article&nbsp;11</U>, the Sellers
will not have any liability under this Agreement (i)&nbsp;as a result of any breach of or inaccuracy in
any representation or warranty referred to in this Agreement or (ii)&nbsp;with respect to the
indemnification obligations provided in <U>Section&nbsp;11.1(c)</U> (including with respect to
indemnification obligations provided in <U>Section&nbsp;11.1(d)</U>, but only with respect to a
Proceeding, demand or assessment incidental to the matters set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;11.1(c)</U>),
until and to the extent the aggregate amount of all such Losses sustained by the Buyer exceeds
$1,000,000, nor will the Sellers&#146; maximum, aggregate liability as a result of any such breach or
inaccuracy exceed the Escrow Amount; provided, however, that nothing in this <U>Section
11.3(b)</U> will limit the Sellers&#146; liability with respect to fraud or with respect to the Seller
Fundamental Representations. After the Closing, other than with respect to fraud, no Seller shall
be liable to any Buyer Indemnitee for any amount exceeding the sum of (a)&nbsp;the portion of the
Purchase Price received by such Seller in exchange for his or her Shares, plus (b)&nbsp;the total value
of distributions received by such Seller from any Non-Natural Person Seller to which such Seller is
a beneficiary. Other than with respect to fraud, Sellers&#146; aggregate liability in the event of a
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;3.5(b)</U> is limited to the
value by which the Companies&#146; estimated net worth was underreported on the financial statement
described on <U>Schedule&nbsp;3.5(b)</U> when compared to the actual financial statement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(c)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers do not have any
individual right to assert any claim for indemnification under this <U>Article&nbsp;11</U> and any such
claim on behalf of the Sellers may be brought only by the Sellers&#146; Representative.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(d)&nbsp;The right to indemnification, payment of damages, forfeiture of some or all of the Escrow
Amount or other remedy pursuant to this <U>Article&nbsp;11</U> will not be affected by the Indemnified
Person&#146;s investigation with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of having been
acquired) about, the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation, warranty,
agreement, covenant or obligation under this Agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant, agreement or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification, payment of
damages, forfeiture of some or all of the Escrow Amount or other remedy based on such
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(e)&nbsp;The Sellers&#146; obligation to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees with respect to a particular Loss
will be reduced by an amount equal to (i)&nbsp;80% of any net insurance proceeds actually received and
retained by the Buyer Indemnitees on account of such Loss under any insurance policy of any of the
Companies that existed prior to the Closing and (ii)&nbsp;the Tax benefit actually realized by the Buyer
Indemnitees on account of the portion of such Loss paid by Sellers, as reduced by clause (i)&nbsp;of
this <U>Section&nbsp;11.3(e)</U>, in the year such Loss occurs and the subsequent two years, whether
realized by way of a refund, credit or reduction in Tax due by a Buyer Indemnitee or any of its
Affiliates, but only with respect to the portion of such Loss that falls within the aggregate claim
thresholds set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;11.3(b)</U>. Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue the insurance proceeds referred to in <U>Section&nbsp;11.3(e)(i)</U>. In computing the amount
of any such Tax benefits, the Buyer Indemnitees shall be deemed to recognize all other items of
income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any items arising from the incurrence
of the Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement. &nbsp;For purposes of this
Agreement, a Buyer Indemnitees shall be deemed to have &#147;realized&#148; a reduction in Taxes to the
extent that, and at such time, as the amount of Taxes (i)&nbsp;payable by the Buyer Indemnitee is
reduced below the amount of Taxes that the Buyer Indemnitee would have been required to pay but
for the incurrence of the Loss such amount for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement, or (ii)&nbsp;refunded or credited to the Buyer Indemnitee is increased above the amount of
Taxes that would have been refunded or credited to the Buyer Indemnitee but for the incurrence of
the Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(f)&nbsp;After the Closing, other than the equitable remedies set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;13.8</U>,
the remedies set forth in <U>Sections&nbsp;11.1</U> and <U>11.2</U> will be the sole and exclusive
remedies with respect to any Losses arising from the breach of any covenant, representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in <U>Articles 3</U> and <U>4</U> of this Agreement
(other than to the extent any such claims are grounded in fraud).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(g)&nbsp;The provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;11</U> shall apply in such a manner as not to give
duplicative effect to any item of adjustment. If, under <U>Section&nbsp;2.5(g)</U>, there has been an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for any Losses, there shall not be any charge against the Escrow
Fund or the deductible provided in <U>Section&nbsp;11.1(b)</U> and the Buyer may claim a breach of any
representation or warranty with respect to any such Losses that gave rise to such adjustment in the
Purchase Price.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(h)&nbsp;The right to indemnification under this <U>Article&nbsp;11</U> will apply only to those claims
for indemnification that are given before the applicable Expiration Date in accordance with
<U>Section&nbsp;11.4</U> or <U>Section&nbsp;11.5</U>, as applicable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(i)&nbsp;Despite anything to the contrary in this <U>Article&nbsp;11</U>, any indemnification
obligations of any of the Sellers to any of the Buyer Indemnities shall be first paid from the
Escrow Funds subject to the Escrow Agreement. After the Escrow Funds are exhausted, the Sellers
will be jointly and severally liable to the Buyer Indemnities for all of their indemnification
obligations to the Buyer Indemnities under this <U>Article&nbsp;11</U>, subject to the limitations
contained in other Sections of this <U>Article&nbsp;11</U>.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(a)&nbsp;Within 10&nbsp;days after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity under <U>Sections&nbsp;11.1</U>
or <U>11.2</U> (an &#147;<U>Indemnified Person</U>&#148;) of notice of the assertion of a third-party claim
against it, the Indemnified Person will, if a claim is to be made against a Person obligated to
indemnify under such Section (an &#147;<U>Indemnifying Person</U>&#148;), give notice (&#147;<U>Claim
Notice</U>&#148;) to the Indemnifying Person (who, in the case of the Sellers, will be, for purposes of
this <U>Section&nbsp;11.4</U>, the Sellers&#146; Representative) of the assertion of such claim. A Claim
Notice must describe such claim in reasonable detail and must indicate the amount (estimated, if
necessary and to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the
Indemnified Person. An Indemnified Person&#146;s failure to give a Claim Notice to an Indemnifying
Person within such 10&nbsp;day period will not relieve the Indemnifying Person of any Liability that it
may have to the Indemnified Person, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person demonstrates
that the resolution of such claim is prejudiced by the Indemnified Person&#146;s failure to give such
notice.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(b)&nbsp;If any claim referred to in <U>Section&nbsp;11.4(a)</U> is brought against an Indemnified
Person by means of a Proceeding, then the Indemnifying Person will be entitled to participate in
such Proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes, to assume the defense of such Proceeding with
counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (unless (i)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Person is also a party
to such Proceeding and the Indemnified Person determines in good faith that joint representation
would be inappropriate or (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Person fails to provide reasonable assurance to the
Indemnified Person of its financial capacity to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification
with respect to such Proceeding) by providing notice (&#147;<U>Response</U>&#148;) to the Indemnified Person
within 10&nbsp;days after receiving a Claim Notice that it will assume such defense. The Response must
clearly state whether the Indemnifying Person is (A)&nbsp;conceding that claims made in that Proceeding
are within the scope of and subject to indemnification hereunder in which case it will be
conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements that they are
or (B)&nbsp;reserving its determination as to whether claims made in that Proceeding are within the
scope of and subject to indemnification hereunder. If the Indemnifying Person assumes such defense
subject to such reservation, then within 15&nbsp;days of providing the Indemnified Person with a
Response, it must provide a second notice to the Indemnified Person stating whether it is conceding
that claims made in that Proceeding are within the scope of and subject to indemnification. If the
Indemnified Person concedes that claims made in that Proceeding are within the scope of and subject
to indemnification, then it will be conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements that they are. After any notice from the Indemnifying Person to the
Indemnified Person of its concession that the claims made are within the scope of and subject to
indemnification, the Indemnifying Person will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense,
be liable to the Indemnified Person under this <U>Article&nbsp;11</U> for any fees of other counsel or
any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Proceeding, in each case subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, other than
reasonable costs of investigation, provided, however, that the Indemnifying Person shall be liable
for any fees of counsel and any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Proceeding
incurred by the Indemnified Person until such time as this notice was provided. The Indemnifying
Party, if it has assumed the defense of any such Proceeding, may not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any such Proceeding that (i)&nbsp;does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party a complete release from all liability in
respect of the claim underlying such Proceeding, (ii)&nbsp;grants any injunctive or equitable relief or
(iii)&nbsp;may reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the affected business of the
Indemnified Party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(c)&nbsp;If a Claim Notice is given to an Indemnifying Person of the commencement of any Proceeding
and the Indemnifying Person does not, within 10&nbsp;days after the Indemnified Person&#146;s Claim Notice is
given, give a Response to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such
Proceeding, then the Indemnifying Person will be bound by any determination made in such Proceeding
or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Person.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">(d)&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person determines in good faith that
there is a reasonable probability that a Proceeding may adversely affect it or its affiliates other
than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, then the Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying Person, assume the
exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Proceeding, but the Indemnifying Person will
not be bound by any determination of a Proceeding so defended or any compromise or settlement
effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld).
