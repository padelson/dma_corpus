     2.5  |   | ADJUSTMENTS  
---|---|--- 
     

(a) Estimates.    

(i) Within five, but no fewer than three, Business Days before the Closing
Date, the Sellers will prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the
Buyer a statement (the " _Estimated Statement_ ") setting forth a good faith
estimate of: (i) the Net Working Capital as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles set forth on  _Schedule
2.5ý(a)_ (such estimate, the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) the
aggregate amount of the Companies Indebtedness (other than Intercompany
Indebtedness) as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated
Indebtedness_ ") and (iii) the aggregate amount of the Selling Expenses (the
" _Estimated Selling Expenses_ "). The Estimated Statement will be subject to
the Buyers approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld. If the Buyer
and the Sellers cannot agree on the Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated
Indebtedness, or Estimated Selling Expenses, then the Buyers estimated values
of such items, proposed in good faith, will be the estimated values of such
items used for purposes of this Agreement. The Sellers and MPC will promptly
provide the Buyer with such documents and information as the Buyer reasonably
requests in connection with its review of the Estimated Statement. Subject to
further adjustment as provided in this _Section 2.5_, the Closing Payment
will be reduced by the (i) Estimated Indebtedness and (ii) the Estimated
Selling Expenses.   

(b) Adjustment Statement. Within 60 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer
will cause to be prepared and delivered to the Sellers Representative an
audited statement (the " _Adjustment Statement_ "), setting forth (i) Net
Working Capital as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date (the " _Final Net
Working Capital_ "); (ii) the aggregate amount of the Companies
Indebtedness (other than Intercompany Indebtedness) as of 12:01 a.m. on the
Closing Date (" _Final Indebtedness_ "); (iii) the actual, aggregate amount
of the Selling Expenses (the " _Final Selling Expenses_ ") and (iv) the Cash
and Cash Equivalents as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date (the " _Final Cash_
"). The Adjustment Statement will be prepared in accordance with
the accounting principles set forth on _Schedule 2.5(a)_.   

(c) Acceptance or Dispute.    

(i) Within 45 days following receipt by the Sellers Representative of the
Adjustment Statement, the Sellers Representative may deliver a written
notice to the Buyer of any dispute it has with respect to the amount of the
Final Net Working Capital, Final Indebtedness, Final Selling Expenses or
Final Cash. If the Sellers Representative does not provide such a notice
to the Buyer within such 45 day period, then the Adjustment Statement will be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties.    

(ii) If the Sellers Representative notifies the Buyer of a dispute within
such 45 day period, then the Buyer and the Sellers Representative will
negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute. If the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative fail to resolve the dispute within 15 days after the Sellers
Representative advises the Buyer of its objections, then the Buyer and the
Sellers Representative will jointly engage a big four accounting firm except
as to any such firm that is then service as the Buyers independent
registered public accountants to resolve such dispute. The Sellers may
propose an eligible big four accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") to
be employed as the Accounting Firm, provided, however that if the Buyer does
not consent to the Sellers initial selection, the Sellers will be permitted
to select another of the eligible big four accounting firms, which such firm
will serve as the Accounting Firm. As promptly as practicable thereafter, the
Buyer and the Sellers Representative will each prepare and submit a
presentation to the Accounting Firm only with respect to the Adjustment
Statement, the specific items and amounts in the Adjustment Statement
remaining under dispute by the parties (and each such presentation will
include a calculation of the Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to _Sections
2.5(f)_ or _Section 2.5(g)_ based on such partys position with respect to
each such item). As promptly as practicable thereafter, the Buyer and the
Sellers Representative will cause the Accounting Firm to (a) only decide the
specific items in the Adjustment Statement in dispute by the parties, solely
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (b) in resolving any
disputed item, assign a value to any item no greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by either party and no less than the smallest value for
such item claimed by either party. The Accounting Firms determination will
be provided to the Buyer and the Sellers Representative in writing and will
be based solely on the presentations by the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative (i.e., not on independent review) and on the definitions and
other terms included herein, including _Schedule 2.5(a)_ (the "
_Final Determination_ "). The Final Net Working Capital, Final Indebtedness,
Final Selling Expenses and Final Cash, will be finally and conclusively
determined to be, respectively, the mean of the values of each such item as
set forth on the Adjustment Statement and the Final Determination. Such
values will be binding upon the parties.   

(d) Fees and Expenses. The fees and expenses, if any, of the Accounting Firm
will be paid by the party disputing the Adjustment Statement, provided,
however, if (i) the Sellers Representative disputes the Adjustment Statement
and (ii) the Accounting Firm determines that the Adjustment Statement was not
prepared in good faith, then the Buyer will bear all of the Accounting
Firms fees.   

(e) Access. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this
_Section  ý2.5_, each party will cooperate with and make available to the
other parties and their respective Representatives all information, records,
data and working papers, and will permit access during normal business hours
and upon reasonable advance notice to its facilities and personnel as may be
reasonably required in connection with the preparation and analysis of
the Adjustment Statement and the resolution of any disputes thereunder.   

(f) Adjustment. The Purchase Price will be:    

(i) adjusted downward by the amount, if any, to which: (a) Final Indebtedness
exceeds the Estimated Indebtedness and (b) the Final Selling Expenses exceed
the Estimated Selling Expenses;    

(ii) adjusted upward by the amount, if any, to which: (a) Final Indebtedness
is less than the Estimated Indebtedness and (b) the Estimated Selling
Expenses exceed the Final Selling Expenses;    

(iii) adjusted upward by the amount of the Final Cash (as determined pursuant
to _Section 2.5(c_ ));    

(iv) to the extent the sum of the EBITDA Adjustment and the Final Net Working
Capital Adjustment (1) exceeds $2,000,000, adjusted upward or (2) is less
than negative $2,000,000, adjusted downward.   

(g) Payment.    

(i) Net Decrease; Payment by the Sellers. If there is a net decrease in the
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.5(f)_, then within five Business Days
of the date on which the Final Determination is rendered or, if applicable,
the date when the Adjustment Statement becomes final under _Section
2.5(c)(i)_, the Sellers Representative will release from the Sellers Escrow
to the Buyer an amount of cash equal to the amount of such reduction, together
with interest thereon from the Closing Date at the rate of 7% per annum;
provided, however that to the extent the Sellers Representative does not
have sufficient funds remaining in the Sellers Escrow to fund such amount,
then each of the Sellers will be jointly and severally liable to the Buyer
for such payments. Such payments will be made within ten Business Days of the
date on which the Final Determination is rendered pursuant to _Section
2.5(c)_.    

(ii) Net Increase and Payment by the Buyer. If there is a net increase in the
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.5(f)_, then within five Business Days
of the date on which the Final Determination is rendered, if applicable, the
date when the Adjustment Statement becomes final under _Section 2.5(c)(i)_,
the Buyer will pay an amount in cash equal to such increase to the Sellers
Representative, together with interest thereon from the Closing Date at the
rate of 7% per annum, for distribution to the Sellers in the proportions set
forth in  _Schedule 2.2(a)_.

withdrawn or rescinded.   

     3.6  |   | BOOKS AND RECORDS  
---|---|---

(a) All Accounts Receivable that are reflected on the Balance Sheet or the
accounting records of any Company as of the Closing Date represent or will
represent valid obligations arising from sales actually made or services
actually performed in the Ordinary Course of Business. All reserves with
respect to such Accounts Receivable have been calculated consistent with GAAP
and past practice (except for changes in estimates). There is no contest,
claim, defense or right of setoff, other than returns in the Ordinary Course
of Business, under any Contract with any obligor of an Account Receivable
relating to the amount or validity of such Account Receivable.   

(b) All items included in the Inventories are of a quality and quantity usable

Business, except for obsolete items and items of below-standard quality, all

value on the Adjustment Statement, or the accounting records of the Companies
as of the Closing Date, as the case may be. All of the Inventories now on
hand that were purchased after the date of the Companies December 31, 2007
audited financial statements were purchased in the Ordinary Course of
Business at a cost not exceeding market prices prevailing at the time
of purchase. The quantities of each item of Inventory (whether raw materials,

circumstances. Work-in-process Inventories are now valued and on the Closing
Date will be valued according to GAAP (except for changes in
estimates), applied on a basis consistent with the bases on which the
December 31, 2007 audited financial statements were prepared. All Inventories

in, or a valid and enforceable license to, all of its tangible assets,
properties and Intellectual Property. Each Company owns good and transferable
title to all other assets owned by it, in each case free and clear of
any Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances.   

(b) _Real Property_.    

(i) No Company owns any Real Property. _Schedule 3.11(b)_ sets forth a true,

and any security deposits. The Leased Real Property comprises all of the Real
Property interests used in the conduct of the business and operations of the
Companies. Each Company owns good and marketable title to its respective
estates in the Leased Real Property, free and clear of any Encumbrances other
than Permitted Encumbrances. No Company has granted any Person the right to
occupy or use any of the Leased Real Property, including by lease, license,
assignment or sublease and no Person, other a Company, is in possession of
any portion of the Leased Real Property. Other than with respect to the

lessor of any Leased Real Property.    

(ii) A true and correct copy of each lease, license or occupancy agreement,
and any amendments thereto, with respect to the Leased Real Property
(collectively, the " _Real Property Leases_ ") has been delivered to the
Buyer, and no changes have been made to any Real Property Lease since the
date of delivery. Each Real Property Lease is in full force and effect and is
valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms. There are no
existing breaches or defaults by any Company or the lessor under any Real
Property Lease and no event has occurred or right exists which (with notice,
lapse of time or both) could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or
default under any Real Property Lease by any party or give any party the
right to terminate, accelerate or modify any Real Property Lease.    

(iii) Use of the Leased Real Property for the various purposes for which it is
presently being used is permitted as of right under applicable zoning Laws
and is not subject to "permitted non-conforming" use or structure
classifications. All Improvements located on the Leased Real Property are in
material compliance with all Laws, including those pertaining to zoning,
building and the disabled. No part of any Improvement encroaches on any Real
Property not included in the Leased Real Property and there are no
Improvements primarily situated on adjoining property which encroach on any
part of the Leased Real Property.    

(iv) There is no pending condemnation, expropriation, eminent domain or
similar Proceeding affecting all or any portion of the Leased Real Property.
The Sellers have not received any written notice or oral notice of any such
Proceeding, and, to the Sellers Knowledge, no such Proceeding is

tangible personal property, with an individual original cost of $500,000 or
more, that is owned or leased by any Company (the " _Tangible Personal
Property_ "). All Tangible Personal Property is in the possession of a
Company.

(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, (i) the Improvements are structurally sound, are in good operating
condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, are free from material
latent and patent defects and are adequate for the uses to which they are
being put and (ii) the Tangible Personal Property is in the aggregate in
good operating condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, free
from material latent and patent defects and suitable in all material respects
for immediate use in the Ordinary Course of Business.   

(b) The Leased Real Property, Tangible Personal Property and Intellectual
Property constitute all such assets necessary for the continued operation of
the business of each Company after the Closing in substantially the same
manner as immediately prior to the Closing.

---|---|---

interest in and to the Intellectual Property, free and clear of all
Encumbrances and of any requirement to make any royalty payments, license
fees and charges, except for such payments, fees and charges of less
than $150,000 per year in the aggregate. Since January 1, 2000, no Company
has, or has agreed to, other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, sell,
license, sublicense, covenant not to sue under, abandon, assign, transfer,
disclose, create an Encumbrance on, or grant any rights to any third party
under any Intellectual Property that is material to any Company. All of the
issued Patents and registered Marks and Copyrights are currently in
compliance with all Laws, and are not subject to any maintenance fees or
Taxes or actions falling due within 90 days after the Closing Date. There are
no actions that must be taken by any Company within 60 days after the Closing
Date that, if not taken, will result in the loss of any issued Patents or
registered Marks or Copyrights, including the payment of any registration,
maintenance or renewal fees.   

(b) The Marks used by the Companies in the operation of their businesses and
the Patents and Copyrights are valid and enforceable, and no Person has
challenged in writing the validity or enforceability of the Marks used by the
Companies in the operation of their businesses or the Patents or Copyrights.
No Patent, Mark or Copyright is currently involved in any
infringement, interference, reissue, reexamination, invalidation,
cancellation or opposition Proceeding and, to the Sellers Knowledge, no such
action has been threatened in writing to any Company or Seller with respect
to any Patent, Mark or Copyright.   

(c) No registered Mark used by the Companies in the operation of their
businesses or issued Patent or Copyright is currently being infringed,
diluted or misappropriated by any other Person.

name, uniform resource locator, system, process or know-how currently used or
held for use in any Companys business, infringes, dilutes, or
misappropriates any patent, trade name, trademark, service mark or other
proprietary right of any other Person. None of the subject matter of any of

work based on the work of any other Person.

Benefit Plan, by the IRS or other Governmental Body to any Seller, any
Company or Affiliate or to such Employee Benefit Plan or the plan
administrator thereof since December 31, 2004 and (ix) copies of most recent
favorable determination letters issued by the IRS with respect to each
Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" and which is
entitled to rely on such determination letter within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code and copies of the most recent opinion letters issued by
the IRS to the sponsor of each master or prototype plan which is an Employee
Benefit Plan that is intended to be so "qualified and which is entitled under
applicable Law to rely on such determination letter.   

(c) Each Company has materially performed and complied with all of their
respective obligations under all Employee Benefit Plans, and each Employee
Benefit Plan has been materially operated and administered in accordance with
its terms in all respects. Each Company has made, or caused to be made,
appropriate entries in its financial records and statements for all
obligations and liabilities under each Employee Benefit Plan that have
accrued but are not due. Each of the Companies, with respect to all Employee
Benefit Plans, is, and each Employee Benefit Plan is in form, operation and
administration, in compliance in all respects with all Laws and the
provisions of all Laws and with any applicable contract or labor or
collective bargaining agreement. No transaction prohibited by ERISA Section
406 that is a non-exempt transaction and no non-exempt "prohibited
transaction" under Code Section 4975(c) has occurred with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan subject to said statutes. No Company has any Liability
to the IRS with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan or any employee benefit
plan of any ERISA Affiliate, including any Liability imposed by Chapter 43 of
the Code, except for contributions which are due and payable but as to which
the required time for payment has not expired. No Seller nor any Company or
other Person has engaged in any act or omission with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plans that could subject any Company (or any officer, director,
employee or independent contractor thereof) to any liability for breach of
fiduciary responsibilities under ERISA. All contributions and payments made or
accrued with respect to all Employee Benefit Plans are deductible under Code
Section 162 or 404 or other Law. There are no unpaid contributions or
payments with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan that are required to have
been made or paid under its terms and provisions, any related trust
or insurance contract or any Law that have not been timely paid. No event has
occurred or circumstance exists that may result in a material increase in
premium costs of Employee Benefit Plans that are insured or a material
increase in benefit costs of Employee Benefit Plans that are self-insured.
Other than routine claims for benefits submitted by participants or
beneficiaries, no claim against, or Proceeding involving, any Employee
Benefit Plan is pending or, to the Sellers Knowledge, is threatened, and no
event has occurred or circumstances exist which could form a reasonable basis
for any such Proceeding.   

(d) Each individually designed Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS that it is qualified under Code
Section 401(a) and that its related trust is exempt from federal income tax
under Code Section 501(a). The sponsor of each prototype plan adopted as
an Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received an opinion letter from the
IRS as to the acceptability of such prototype plan under Code Section 401(a),
and each Company timely adopted such plan, and each Company timely adopted
such plan. No event has occurred or circumstance exists that may give rise
to disqualification or loss of tax-exempt status of any such plan or trust.
There is no unfunded liability under any Employee Benefit Plan, and no
Employee Benefit Plan has incurred any accumulated funding deficiency (within
the meaning of Section 412 of the Code as in effect prior to 2008) or failed
to satisfy the minimum funding standards (as required by Section 412 of the
Code as in effect after 2007), whether or not waived.   

(e) No Company or ERISA Affiliate has ever established, maintained or
contributed to, or had an obligation to maintain or contribute to, any
Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA. No Company has
ever established, maintained or contributed to, or had an obligation to
maintain or contribute to, any organization or trust described in Code Section
501(c)(9), 501(c)(17) or 501(c)(20), or any welfare benefit fund as defined
in Code Section 419(e). No Company or ERISA Affiliate has ever established,
maintained or contributed to or otherwise participated in, or had an
obligation to maintain, contribute to or otherwise participate in,
any "multiemployer pension plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA) or any "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as such terms is
defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA). Except to the extent required under ERISA
Section 601 et seq. and Code Section 4980B and any similar state laws, no
Company provides health or welfare benefits for any retired or former
employee, officer, director, independent contractor or consultant, nor is it
obligated to provide health or welfare benefits to any active employee,
officer, director, independent contractor or consultant following retirement
or other termination of service.   

(f) Each Company has the right to modify and terminate benefits provided under
any Employee Benefit Plan to retirees (other than pensions) with respect to
both retired and active employees.   

(g) No individual classified as a non-employee for purposes of receiving
employee benefits (such as an independent contractor, leased employee or
consultant), regardless of treatment for other purposes, is eligible to
participate in or receive benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan.   

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event) will result in the payment, vesting, acceleration or funding of
any benefit, or any increase in the amount of compensation due or benefits
payable, under or in connection with any Employee Benefit Plan.   

(i) Each Employee Benefit Plan outside the United States required to be
registered with any Governmental Body has been registered and maintained in
good standing with applicable authorities, and each Employee Benefit Plan
outside the United States that is intended to be subject to beneficial tax
treatment is subject to such treatment and nothing has occurred that could
reasonably affect such status.   

(j) Except for any other Company, no Company now has, nor has it ever had, any
ERISA Affiliate. For purposes of this Agreement, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means
any other Person that, together with a Company, would be treated as a single
employer under Code Section 414(b),(c), (m), or (o).   

(k) Each Employee Benefit Plan subject to Code Section 409A is and has been
operated in compliance therewith since the effective date of Section
409A.   

(l) No Company has made or become obligated to make, and will not as a result
of any Contemplated Transaction become obligated to make, any payments that
could be nondeductible by reason of Section 280G (without regard to
subsection (b)(4) thereof) or 162(m) of the Code, nor will any Company be
required to "gross up" or otherwise compensate any individual because of
the imposition of any excise tax on such a payment to the individual.

Securities Act and cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the
Securities Act unless an exemption from such registration is available.   

     4.5  |   | BROKERS OR FINDERS  
---|---|---

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties in this Agreement and in the Ancillary Agreements, none of the

any of the Companies or any of the Sellers, or as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information furnished or made available to Buyer or
its Representatives.

vendors, representatives and (ii) furnish the Buyer and its
Representatives with copies of all such Contracts, Company Books and Records

(ii) deliver the Buyer an accurate and complete copy (in the case of each
written Applicable Other Contract) or accurate and complete written summary
(in the case of each oral Applicable Other Contract) of each of the
Applicable Other Contracts; and    

(iii) provide a schedule of Applicable Contracts, organized into the
categories set forth in  _Sections 3.14(a)_ and _3.14(d)_.   

(b) Within 15 days of the date hereof, the Sellers will, or will cause the

complete and accurate copies of such audited Financial Statements (the "
_Audited Financial Statements_ ").   

(c) Within 15 days of the date hereof, Seller shall deliver all reports in its
possession to Buyer. Within ten (10) days of the date the reports are
delivered, Buyer shall advise the Sellers Representative whether or not it
intends to perform an environmental site assessment on the property. Should
Buyer not so advise Sellers Representative by such deadline, or if Buyer
advises Sellers Representative that it does not intend to perform an
environmental site assessment, Buyer shall have been deemed to have waived
its opportunity to perform such assessment.

Agreement and the Closing Date, the Sellers, Techni-Core and MPC will and
will cause MPC Europe to: (i) conduct the businesses of each Company in the

outside the Ordinary Course of Business, and Buyer consents to such action,
which such consent will not be unreasonably withheld; (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve intact the current businesses
and organizations of the each Company, keep available the services of the
current Representatives of each Company and maintain relations and goodwill
with suppliers, customers, landlords, creditors, employees, agents and others
having business relationships with any Company; (iii) not, without the prior
written Consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, (A) make or change any Tax election, (B)
change any annual Tax accounting period, (C) file any amended Tax Return, (D)
enter into any closing agreement, (E) settle any Tax claim or assessment, (F)
surrender any right to claim a Tax refund, or (G) consent to any extension
or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment,

materially increasing the Tax liability of the Companies for any period
ending after the Closing Date or materially decreasing any Tax attribute of
the Companies existing on the Closing Date; and (iv) not enter into any
collective bargaining agreements without the Buyers consent.   

     5.3  |   | NEGATIVE COVENANTS  
---|---|--- 
     

(a) Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement, between the
date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Sellers will not, and will
cause each Company not to, without the Buyers prior consent, which will not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, take any affirmative

result of which any of the representations in _Sections 3.10_ or
_3.20(d)(i)_ becomes or is likely to be untrue.   

(b) Without Buyers consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the
Sellers and Techni-Core will not, except in connection with the death of the
Shareholder, sell, assign or otherwise transfer any of their respective
Shares, or discuss, negotiate, make an offer or enter into an
agreement, commitment or other arrangement with respect thereto.   

     5.4  |   | REQUIRED APPROVALS  
---|---|--- 
     

As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Sellers,
Techni-Core and MPC will, and will cause the Companies to, as required by Law
in order to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, obtain all Consents,

the Closing Date, the Sellers, Techni-Core and MPC will, and will cause the
Companies to, cooperate with the Buyer with respect to all Consents, filings
and notices that the Buyer elects to obtain, make or give or that Laws

or Company becomes aware of: (i) any fact or condition that causes or
constitutes a breach of any of the Sellers representations and warranties as

Agreement of any fact or condition that would (except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a breach of any such
representation or warranty had that representation or warranty been made as
of the time of the occurrence or discovery of such fact or condition. Should
any such fact or condition require any change in the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule, the Sellers Representatives will promptly deliver to
the Buyer a supplement to the Sellers Disclosure Schedule specifying such
change. Such delivery will not affect any rights of the Buyer under _Articles
9_ or _11._ During the same period, the Sellers Representatives will
promptly notify the Buyer of the occurrence of any breach of any covenant
of the Sellers, Techni-Core and MPC in this _Article 5_ or of the occurrence
of any event that may make the satisfaction of the conditions in _Article 8_
impossible or unlikely.   

(b) The Sellers will cause the Sellers Representative to promptly notify the

involving or otherwise affecting any Company which relate to the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions; and    

(iv) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or

     5.6  |   | NO NEGOTIATION  
---|---|--- 
     

(a) The Sellers, Techni-Core and MPC will not, will cause the Companies not to

Proposal;    

(iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal;    

(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or    

(v) enter into any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any violation of any of
the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Seller or
Company, or their respective Affiliates or Representatives, whether or not
such Affiliate is purporting to act on behalf of any Seller or Company, will
be deemed to constitute a material breach of this _Section 5.6_ by the
Sellers.   

(c) The Sellers, Techni-Core and MPC will, and will cause the Companies to,
promptly (and in no case later than 24 hours after receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that could lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information concerning any
Company outside the Ordinary Course of Business) advise the Buyer orally and
in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest
that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information relating to any of the Companies (including the identity of the
Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of
interest or request, and the terms thereof) that is made or submitted by any
Person. The Sellers will keep the Buyer fully informed with respect to the
status of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or
request and any modification or proposed modification thereto.   

(d) The Sellers, Techni-Core and MPC will, and will cause the Companies and
their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions with any Person that relate to any
Acquisition Proposal.   

(e) The Sellers, Techni-Core and MPC will not release or permit the release of
any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which any Company or
any Seller is a party, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to
enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement at the request of
the Buyer. The Sellers will promptly request each Person that has executed,

agreement in connection with its consideration of a possible Acquisition
Transaction or equity investment to return or destroy all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf
of any Company.   

     5.7  |   | EFFORTS  
---|---|---

(b) terminate or cause to be terminated any Contract between a Company and any
Seller or Affiliate of any Seller, other than (i) Contracts between two

ARTICLE 6    

COVENANTS OF BUYER BEFORE CLOSING    

     6.1  |   | REQUIRED APPROVALS  
---|---|--- 
     

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Buyer will
cooperate with the Sellers Representative with respect to all Consents,
filings and notices that the Sellers Representative elects to obtain, make
or give or that Laws require the Sellers to obtain, make or give in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions, including (i) any HSR Required
Filings, (ii) any Export Control Laws, and (iii) any filings required by any
other applicable antitrust or fair trade law, of any applicable foreign
jurisdiction as determined by the Buyer; provided, however, that this
_Section 6.1_ will not require the Buyer to dispose of or make any change in
any portion of its business or to incur any other burden except as
contemplated by this Agreement.   

     6.2  |   | EFFORTS  
---|---|--- 
     

Except as set forth in the proviso to _Section 6.1_, the Buyer will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions in _Sections 8.3_
and _Article 9_ to be satisfied.   

     6.3  |   | NOTIFICATION  
---|---|--- 
     

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Buyer will
promptly notify the Sellers Representative if the Buyer becomes aware of:
(a) any fact or condition that causes or constitutes a breach of any of the
Buyers representations and warranties as of the date of this Agreement or
(b) the occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any fact or condition
that would (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or
constitute a breach of any such representation or warranty had that
representation or warranty been made as of the time of the occurrence or
discovery of such fact or condition. Should any such fact or condition require
any change in the Buyers Disclosure Schedule, the Buyer will promptly
deliver to the Sellers Representative a supplement to the Buyers Disclosure
Schedule specifying such change. Such delivery will not affect any rights of
the Sellers under _Articles 9_ and _11._ During the same period, the Buyer
will promptly notify the Sellers Representative of the occurrence of any
breach of any covenant of the Buyer in this _Article 6_ or of the occurrence
of any event that may make the satisfaction of the conditions in _Article 9_
impossible or unlikely.   

ARTICLE 7    

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES    

     7.1  |   | TAXES  
---|---|--- 
     

(a) Tax Returns. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, any Tax
Return to be prepared pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 7.1(a)_,
including any amendments thereto, shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with practices followed by the Companies in prior years with respect to
similar Tax Returns, except for changes required by changes in applicable
Law or changes in fact. The following provisions shall govern the allocation
of responsibility as between the Parties for certain Tax matters following
the Closing Date:    

(i) The Buyer, at its own expense, shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and
file (or cause to be filed) when due all Tax Returns that are required to be
filed by or with respect to any Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period that are required to be filed after the Closing Date and all Tax
Returns with respect to a Straddle Period. Buyer will provide a copy of each
such Tax Return (with copies of any supporting schedules, workpapers and other
relevant documentation) and, in the case of a Tax Return for a Straddle
Period, a statement setting forth the amount of Taxes allocable to the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period (with copies of any supporting schedules, workpapers
and other relevant documentation), to the Sellers Representative, in
the case of an income Tax Return, no later than 60 days prior to the date on
which such Tax Return is due, and in the case of a non-Income Tax Return, no
later than 15 days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due, and the
Sellers Representative will advise Buyer in writing of any proposed change
to such Tax Return (a " _Buyer s Change_", in the case of an Income
Tax Return, not less than 30 days prior to its due date, and in the case of a
non-Income Tax Return, not less than 5 days prior to its due date. Buyer
shall, in preparing such Tax Return, cause the items for which Sellers may be
liable hereunder to be reflected in accordance with the instructions provided
by Sellers Representative unless, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
law firm or accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and the
Sellers Representative (the " _Tax Opinion Firm_ "), complying with the
instructions provided by Sellers Representative would result in Buyer taking
a position on such Tax Return that does not satisfy the "more likely than
not" requirement.    

(ii) If Buyer decides to seek a Tax opinion in accordance with _Section
7.1(a)(i)_, Buyer shall act promptly and in good faith to obtain such an
opinion. In the event the Tax Opinion Firm is unable to issue its Tax opinion
before the due date for filing such Tax Return, the Buyer may timely file
such Tax Return without making the disputed Buyer Change. In the event the
Tax opinion, when issued by the Tax Opinion Firm, necessitates that a Tax
Return filed in accordance with the previous sentence be amended, Buyer shall
cause such amended Tax Return to be filed promptly after such resolution that
incorporates the conclusion expressed in such opinion.    

(iii) For purposes of _Section 7.1(a)(i)_, a position satisfies the "more
likely than not" requirement if such position would more likely than not be
affirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction if such position were to be
challenged and disallowed by the applicable Taxing Authority. The fees and
other costs incurred by Buyer in connection with such opinion shall be borne
by Buyer unless the Tax Opinion Firm opines that the instructions provided by
Sellers Representative would result in Buyer taking a position that does not
satisfy the "more likely than not" requirement, in which event such fees and
costs shall be borne by the Sellers Representative."   

(b) Cooperation. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit
examinations, and any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the
Tax liabilities imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary for all Pre-Closing
Tax Periods, the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand,
shall cooperate fully with each other, including, without limitation,
the furnishing or making available during normal business hours of records,
personnel (as reasonably required), books of account, powers of attorney or
other materials necessary or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns,
the conduct of audit examinations or the defense of claims by Taxing
Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes. The Buyer shall and shall cause the
Companies to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to any Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Buyer or the Sellers Representative, any
extension thereof) for the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority. The Buyer
and the Sellers Representative shall, upon request, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Body or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce
or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to,
with respect to the Contemplated Transactions). The Sellers will deliver to
Buyer within 20 Business Days of Buyers request any information required to
be reported by the Buyer, the Companies or any Affiliate of the
foregoing under Section 6043A of the Code.   

(c) Payment of Pre-Closing Taxes. The Buyer shall provide written notice to
the Sellers Representative of the amount of any Taxes for which the Sellers
are liable under _Section 11.1(b)_ of this Agreement with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period and any Pre-Closing Straddle Period, together with copies
of any relevant schedules, workpapers and other relevant documentation to
establish the amount of such Taxes. The Sellers Representative, on behalf of
the Sellers, shall pay to the applicable Company the amount of Taxes, if any,
for which the Sellers are liable at least two Business Days prior to the date
on which the Tax Returns for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and for the Straddle
Period are due to be filed with the relevant Taxing Authority;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Sellers Representative shall not be required to pay any
Tax earlier than ten Business Days after its receipt of such written notice.
In the event Buyer disagrees with a Buyer Change and submits the issue to a
Tax Opinion Firm in accordance with  _Section 7.1(a)(i)_, the amount of Tax
payable by the Sellers Representative to Buyer shall be calculated on the
assumption that the Buyers Change is correct. The Buyer shall
promptly provide the Sellers Representative a copy of any opinion issued by
the Tax Opinion Firm, together with revised schedules, workpapers and other
relevant documents establishing the additional amount of Taxes, if any, which
are payable by the Sellers Representative; such additional Taxes, if
any, shall be paid by the Sellers Representative within ten Business Days
after receipt of such written information.   

(d) Straddle Period Allocation. For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of
any Tax payable with respect to a Straddle Period will be allocated between
the period of the Straddle Period that extends before the Closing Date
through the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_ ") and the
period of the Straddle Period that extends from the day after the Closing
Date to the end of the Straddle Period (the " _Post-Closing Straddle Period_
") in accordance with this _Section 7.4(d)_. The portion of such Tax
allocable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall (i) in the case of any
Taxes other than sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes,
withholding taxes and any Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or
profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of
any sales or uses taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes, withholding
taxes and any Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned
during a Straddle Period, be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the Straddle Period ended on and included the Closing Date. To the
extent that any Tax for a Straddle Period is based on the greater of a Tax on
net income, on the one hand, and a Tax measured by net worth or some other
basis not otherwise measured by income, on the other, the portion of such Tax
related to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period will be deemed to be (1) if the
amount of such Tax for the Straddle Period is measured by net worth or other
basis, the amount of such Tax determined as though the taxable values for the
entire Straddle Period equal the respective values as of the Closing Date and
multiplying the amount of such Tax by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in
the Straddle Period or (2) if the amount of such Tax for the Straddle Period
is measured by net income, the amount of such Tax determined as though the
applicable Tax period terminated at the end of the day on the Closing Date.
In the case of a Tax that is (a) paid for the privilege of doing business
during a period (a " _Privilege Period_ ") and (b) computed based on business
activity occurring during an accounting period ending prior to the Privilege
Period, any reference to a "Tax period," a "tax period" or a "taxable period"
shall mean such accounting period and not the Privilege Period. With respect
to real property Taxes and personal property Taxes described in (i) above, the
allocation shall be made on the basis of the most recent officially certified
Tax valuation and assessment for the real property or the personal property,
as the case may be. If such valuation pertains to a tax period other than
that in which the Closing Date occurs, such apportionment will be recalculated
at such time as actual Tax bills for such period are available, and the
parties will cooperate with each other in all respects in connection with
such recalculation and pay any sums due in consequence thereof to the party
entitled to recover the same within sixty (60) days after the issuance of
such actual Tax bills. The portion of Tax attributable to a Post-Closing
Straddle Period will be calculated in a corresponding manner.   

(e) Tax Matters. Whenever any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an
assessment, or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which the Sellers
may be liable under this Agreement, the Buyer shall, within ten (10) days
after receipt of such assertion, inform the Sellers Representative in
writing (" _Tax Notice_ "). The Tax Notice must describe such assertion
in reasonable detail and must indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary
and to the extent feasible) of the Adverse Consequence that has been or may
be suffered by the Sellers and the Sellers Representative. The Buyers
failure to give a Tax Notice the Sellers Representative within such ten (10)
day period will not relieve the Sellers Representative of any Liability that
it may have to the Buyer, except to the extent that the Sellers
Representative demonstrates that the resolution of such claim is prejudiced
by the Buyers failure to give such notice.    

(i) Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Matter. The Sellers Representative has the
right to represent the interests of the Companies before the relevant Taxing
Authority with respect to any audit, claim or contest relating to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Matter_ ") and has the right to
control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any such Pre-
Closing Tax Matter, including responding to inquiries, filing Tax Returns and
contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for additional
Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or
relating to, such Pre-Closing Tax Matter. The Buyer has the right (but not
the duty) to participate in the defense of such Pre-Closing Tax Matter and to
employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from counsel employed by the
Sellers Representative. The Sellers Representative shall not enter into any
settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Pre-Closing Tax Matter to the
extent that it adversely affects the Tax liability of the Buyer without the
prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.    

(ii) Straddle Period Tax Matter. The Buyer has the right to represent the
interests of the Companies before the relevant Taxing Authority with respect
to any audit, claim or contest relating to a Straddle Period (a " _Straddle
Period Tax Matter_ ") and has the right to control the defense, compromise or
other resolution of any such Straddle Period Tax Matter, including responding
to inquiries, filing Tax Returns and contesting, defending against
and resolving any assessment for additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency
or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, such Straddle Period Tax
Matter. If the Sellers would be required to indemnify the Buyer, the Company
or any of their Affiliates pursuant to _Section 11.1(b)_ of this Agreement
with respect to such Straddle Period Tax Matter then: (A) the Sellers have
the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense of such Straddle
Period Tax Matter and to employ counsel, at their own expense, separate from
counsel employed by the Buyer, and (B) the Buyer shall not enter into any
settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Straddle Period Tax Matter to
the extent that it adversely affects the Tax liability of the Sellers without
the prior written consent of the Sellers, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.   

(f) Transfer Taxes. All transfer, excise, franchise, property, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connect ion with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") will be
borne one-half by the Sellers, on the one hand, and one-half by Buyer, on the
other hand, when due. All necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to Transfer Taxes will be prepared and filed by the party required to
file such Tax Returns under applicable Law.   

(g) Post-Closing Consolidated Tax Return. The Buyer shall elect to file a
consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return with Techni-Core and MPC for the
taxable year of Buyer that includes the day after the Closing Date.   

(h) Closing of the Tax Year. The parties acknowledge and agree that, as a
consequence of the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) the taxable year of
Techni-Core and MPC shall close for U.S. federal income tax purposes at the
end of the day on the Closing Date, (ii) to the extent applicable Law in
other taxing jurisdictions so permits, the taxable year of Techni-Core and
MPC shall close at the end of the day on the Closing Date, and (iii) all
federal, state, local and foreign Income Tax Returns of Techni-Core and MPC
shall be filed on the foregoing basis.   

(i) Closing Date Transactions. Each Company shall report all transactions not
in the Ordinary Course of Business, which occur on the Closing Date and after
the Closing, on the consolidated U.S. federal Income Tax Return of such
Company and Buyer for the Post-Closing Period to the extent permitted by
Treasury Regulation §1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (and to the extent permitted or
required under comparable provisions of state, local and foreign Tax
law).   

(j) Amendment of Tax Returns. Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates, nor
any Company, shall amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return
of any Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior
written consent of the Sellers Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless otherwise required by applicable
Law. Except with respect to amendments required by Law, the Sellers
Representative may withhold its consent in its sole and absolute discretion
if it reasonably determines that such amendment, refiling, revocation, or
other modification may (i) increase the income or gain, or decrease
the deductions, losses or credits, of a Company for a taxable period or
portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) increase the
indemnification obligation of any Seller under this Agreement.   

(k) Refunds or Credits. To the extent not specifically identified as an asset
in Final Net Working Capital, the Buyer shall within 10 Business Days pay to
the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) any refunds or credits
of Taxes attributable to any Company that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or a Pre-Closing Straddle Period as follows: (i) in the case of a
refund, when such refund is actually received by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, any of the Companies), and (ii) in the case of a
credit, when such credit is applied against, credited to, or used to offset
Taxes or other amounts owed or otherwise payable by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including any of the Companies); _provided_ , _however_ , to the
extent such refund or credit of Taxes is attributable (i) a Buyer Tax Act,
such refunds or credits shall be for the account of the Buyer, and (ii) to a
net operating loss or other Tax attribute of the Buyer, any Company, or any
Affiliate of the foregoing generated in or otherwise attributable to either
a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date or the Post-Closing
Straddle Period, such refunds and credits shall be for the account of the
Buyer if the carryback of such loss or other Tax attribute was permitted
under this Agreement. The Buyer shall be entitled to all other refunds
and credits of Taxes.   

(l) Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax allocation agreements, Tax sharing
agreements or similar agreements with respect to or involving any Company
will be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, no
Company will be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder, other than
such allocation, sharing and similar agreements entered into by one or more
Companies with a third party that is not a Taxing Authority.   

(m) Post Closing Tax Obligations. Buyer shall be responsible for all Taxes
incurred by or with respect to each of the Companies, whether resulting from
the assets or operations of the Companies or otherwise, for all taxable
periods or portions thereof beginning after the Closing Date, including the
Post-Closing Straddle Period. In the event the Sellers or the
Sellers Representative pays any such Taxes after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall reimburse the Sellers Representative therefor within two Business Days
after the date on which the Taxes are paid.   

(n) Other Tax Matters.    

(i) None of Buyer, the Companies, or any of their Affiliates shall make any
election under Code Section 338 (or any comparable provision of state, local
or foreign law) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.    

(ii) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law or expressly permitted under
this Agreement, no party or any of its Affiliates shall make or change any
Tax election, amend any Tax Return, take any action or enter into any
transaction, in each case after the Closing, that results in any increased
Tax liability of any other party, or that increases the
indemnification obligation of any other party or any other partys Affiliates
under this Agreement.   

(o) Certain Post-Closing Settlement Payments. If the examination of, or
amendment or other adjustment to, a Tax Return of a Company for a taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date results (by
settlement, assessment, or otherwise) in any adjustment which permits Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including a Company) to increase the amount of
deductions, losses or Tax credits, or to decrease the amount of income, gains
or the recapture of Tax credits, which would otherwise (but for such
adjustments) have been reported or taken into account (including by way of
any increase in basis) by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including a
Company) for one or more periods ending after the Closing Date (a " _Post-
Closing Tax Adjustment_ "), Buyer shall promptly (i) notify the Sellers
Representative of such Post-Closing Tax Adjustment, and (ii) pay to the
Sellers Representative the Tax Benefit attributable to such Post-
Closing Adjustment within ten Business Days.   

(p) Certain Pre-Closing Adjustments. If Buyer determines that an adjustment
to a previously filed Tax Return of a Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
would result in an adjustment which would permit a Company to increase the
amount of deductions, losses or Tax credits, or to decrease the amount of
income or gains than had been reported on such Tax Return (a " _Pre-Closing
Tax Adjustment_ "), Buyer shall (i) notify the Sellers Representative of
such Pre-Closing Tax Adjustment and (ii) obtain the prior written consent of
the Sellers Representative, such consent to be granted or withheld in
accordance with the standards set forth in _Section 7.1(j)_. If Sellers
Representative consents to such Pre-Closing Tax Adjustment to the Tax Return,
the Sellers Representative shall pay to Buyer within 10 Business Days an
amount equal to 25% of any refunds or credits of Taxes actually received by
the Company, but only if and to the extent such refund or credit is
attributable to such Pre-Closing Tax Adjustment. In computing the amount
of any such Tax benefits, the Company shall be deemed to recognize all other
items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit with respect to such taxable
year (including any other adjustments that may be made, whether required by
Law or otherwise) before recognizing any items related to such Pre-Closing
Tax Adjustment and shall be deemed to have paid the amount of Taxes owed with
respect to any other adjustments (whether required by Law or otherwise) in
computing the amount of the refund or credit attributable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Adjustment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such adjustment is required
by Law, or is accepted by a Taxing Authority in connection with a Pre-Closing
Tax Matter or a Straddle Period Tax Matter, then any resultant refunds or
credits of Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Pre-Closing Straddle
Period shall be paid in full by Buyer to the Sellers Representative within
ten Business Days, and the Buyer shall not be entitled to receive or retain
25% of any such Tax refund or credit.   

     7.2  |   | PRESS RELEASE AND ANNOUNCEMENTS  
---|---|--- 
     

The Sellers have the sole right to draft any portion of any press release
which refers to Joseph or Vince Roberti, which language will be subject to
approval by the Buyer, which such approval will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. No party will issue any press release or announcement
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or Contemplated Transactions
without the prior approval of the Shareholders Representative and the Buyer;
provided that the Buyer may make any public disclosure it believes in good
faith is required by Law or the rules of any securities exchange or any
automated inter-dealer quotation system on which the securities of the Buyer
are listed or admitted for trading.   

     7.3  |   | THIRD PARTY CLAIMS AGAINST DIRECTORS  
---|---|--- 
     

The Buyer will cause MPC to, following the Closing, indemnify each individual
serving as of the date hereof as a member of the board of directors or an
officer of MPC (as described in MPCs Organizational Documents) against third
party claims solely to the extent arising from or solely to the extent
relating to the Companies conduct following the Closing to the same extent as
MPCs then current directors and officers would be indemnified for such
claims.   

     7.4  |   | PENDING INVESTIGATION  
---|---|--- 
     

(a) Following the Closing, the Buyer will cause MPC to indemnify and defend
and will use reasonable best efforts, to the extent in MPCs control, to
cause MPC to obtain a concurrent release of the Techni-Core Shareholders with
respect to the facts underlying the investigation set forth on _Schedule
1.2_, provided, however, MPC will have no obligation to defend or indemnify
the Techni-Core Shareholders in the event the financial statements described
in  _Schedule 3.5(b)_ were fraudulently submitted.   

(b) The Buyer will cause MPC not to seek contribution, indemnity or other
remedy from, or otherwise institute any Proceeding against, any Seller with
respect to any settlement, resolution, finding or other disposition of the
Proceeding set forth on _Schedule 1.2_ or the defense thereof, provided,
however, that nothing in this _Section 7.4(b)_ shall in any way
modify, change, alter, terminate, reduce or diminish Buyers rights to be
indemnified by Sellers as otherwise set forth in this Agreement with respect
to other matters or acts by such Persons (including a breach of the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.5(b)_).

ARTICLE 9    

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO SELLERS OBLIGATION TO CLOSE

     9.1  |   | ACCURACY OF REPRESENTATIONS  
---|---|--- 
     

(a) Each of the Buyers representations and warranties in this Agreement will

specific representation or warranty), in each case on the date of this
Agreement and on and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the

     9.4  |   | REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY INSURANCE  
---|---|--- 
     

(a) Buyer will not, and will cause the Companies not to, enter into any
agreement with any insurer specifically for the purpose of insuring against a
breach by Sellers of their representations, warranties and covenants under
this Agreement that enables such insurer to seek indemnity, contribution or
subrogation to the extent the amount recoverable by the insurer against the
Sellers on account of a claim exceeds the maximum the Buyer would be able to
recover in an action directly against the Sellers for its own interests
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  In the event that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, such insurer seeks contribution, indemnity or subrogation
against any of the Sellers, Buyer hereby agrees that Sellers (individually or
in the aggregate) shall not be liable for an amount or amounts that,
individually or in the aggregate, (x) exceed or would exceed the maximum
liability of the Sellers hereunder or (y) would result in a duplicate payment
by any of the Sellers under the terms of this Agreement. To the extent that
such insurers claim for contribution, indemnity or subrogation against any
of the Sellers would result in liability of the Sellers or any Seller in
excess of the maximum liability of the Sellers or any such Seller provided
hereunder or would result in a duplicate payment by any of the Sellers,
Buyer agrees to, or will cause MPC to, defend such Sellers or Seller with
respect to such claim and Buyer will, or will cause MPC to, indemnify and
hold harmless the applicable Sellers or Seller from such claim and liability,
but only to the extent such claim exceeds the Sellers or applicable
Sellers maximum liability for such claim under this Agreement or results in
a duplicate payment by any of the Sellers pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.   

(b) The parties hereto agree that this _Section 9.4_ provides that, with
respect to any claims by the Buyer, the Companies or the Buyers or
Companies insurers, no Seller shall at any point be liable for an amount or
amounts that in the aggregate would exceed such Sellers maximum liability
for Losses under this Agreement. In the event that a claim is made against any
Seller for any amount described in the prior sentence of this _Section
9.4(b)_, Buyer and MPC each agree to indemnify and hold harmless any such
Seller from such Loss as set forth in this  _Section 9.4_.   

(c) Buyer will not, and will cause the Companies not to, seek any claim of
indemnity from any insurer described in the first sentence of _Section
9.4(a)_ for matters arising solely out of a breach of a Seller Fundamental
Representation or solely out of a breach of covenants, other than with
respect to covenants related to representations or warranties that are not
Seller Fundamental Representations, if the effect of such claim results or
may result in a claim by such insurer against any Seller for indemnity,
contribution or subrogation for such breach of a Seller Fundamental
Representation or covenant.

party on or before the Closing Date) or    

(ii) if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Body has
issued a final and nonappealable order, decree or ruling, or has taken any
other action, having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Contemplated Transactions;

(i) upon written notice to the Sellers Representative, and provided that
Buyer is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,

date or period of time specified for performance has lapsed, promptly
following written notice thereof from Buyer or (B) is incapable of being

obligations or covenants contained in this Agreement, and such breach
or failure to perform: (A) is not cured within ten (10) days after written
notice thereof or, in the case where the date or period of time specified for
performance has lapsed, promptly following written notice thereof from Buyer
or (B) is incapable of being cured by the breaching party; or    

(vi) upon written notice to the Sellers Representative if, since the date of
this Agreement, there has occurred any Material Adverse Effect, or there has

Effect, that: (A) is not cured within the later of (1) fourteen (14) days
after written notice thereof and (2) December 1, 2008 or (B) is incapable
of being cured.   

(d) by the Sellers Representative if:    

(i) any of the Buyers representations and warranties are or become inaccurate
such that the condition set forth in _Section 9.1_ could not be
satisfied;    

(ii) any of the Buyers covenants contained in this Agreement have been
breached such that the condition set forth in _Section 9.2_ could not be
satisfied; or

MPC or Techni-Core is then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement, if Buyer
has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
obligations or covenants contained in this Agreement, and such breach
or failure to perform: (A) is not cured within ten (10) days after written
notice thereof or, in the case where the date or period of time specified for
performance has lapsed, promptly following written notice thereof from the
Sellers Representative or (B) is incapable of being cured by
the Buyer.   

     10.2  |   | EFFECT OF TERMINATION

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1_, then, the
following will apply:

breach will be indemnity under _Article 11_ until and to the extent Buyers
aggregate Losses arising from any such breach equals $5 million, except that
the $5 million cap will not apply if Buyer so terminates because of any
Sellers fraudulent misrepresentation of any of the Sellers Fundamental
Representations or the representation set forth in _Section 3.8_ ;   

(d) if Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement under _Sections
10.1(c)(iii)_,  _10.1(c)(iv)_ , _10.1(c)(v)_ or _10.1(c)(vi)_ because any of
the Sellers, Techni-Core, or MPC willfully breached any of their respective
covenants under this Agreement (other than their covenants under _Sections
5.3(b)_ or _5.6_ then, the Buyers sole remedy (in addition to termination)

however, that the Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
pay such amounts as soon as reasonably practicable; and   

(g) the limitations on Buyers right of recovery set forth in _Sections

and indemnified against until finally resolved.   

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Article 11_,
the Sellers will not have any liability under this Agreement (i) as a result
of any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty referred to
in this Agreement or (ii) with respect to the indemnification obligations
provided in _Section 11.1(c)_ (including with respect to indemnification
obligations provided in _Section 11.1(d)_, but only with respect to
a Proceeding, demand or assessment incidental to the matters set forth in
_Section 11.1(c)_), until and to the extent the aggregate amount of all such
Losses sustained by the Buyer exceeds $1,000,000, nor will the Sellers
maximum, aggregate liability as a result of any such breach or inaccuracy
exceed the Escrow Amount; provided, however, that nothing in this
_Section 11.3(b)_ will limit the Sellers liability with respect to fraud or
with respect to the Seller Fundamental Representations. After the Closing,
other than with respect to fraud, no Seller shall be liable to any Buyer
Indemnitee for any amount exceeding the sum of (a) the portion of
the Purchase Price received by such Seller in exchange for his or her Shares,
plus (b) the total value of distributions received by such Seller from any
Non-Natural Person Seller to which such Seller is a beneficiary. Other than
with respect to fraud, Sellers aggregate liability in the event of a breach
of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.5(b)_ is
limited to the value by which the Companies estimated net worth was
underreported on the financial statement described on _Schedule 3.5(b)_ when
compared to the actual financial statement.   

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers do
not have any individual right to assert any claim for indemnification under
this _Article 11_ and any such claim on behalf of the Sellers may be brought
only by the Sellers Representative.   

(d) The right to indemnification, payment of damages, forfeiture of some or
all of the Escrow Amount or other remedy pursuant to this _Article 11_ will
not be affected by the Indemnified Persons investigation with respect to, or
any knowledge acquired (or capable of having been acquired) about, the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation,
warranty, agreement, covenant or obligation under this Agreement. The waiver
of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or
on the performance of or compliance with any covenant, agreement or
obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification, payment of damages,
forfeiture of some or all of the Escrow Amount or other remedy based on
such representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation.   

(e) The Sellers obligation to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees with respect to a
particular Loss will be reduced by an amount equal to (i) 80% of any net
insurance proceeds actually received and retained by the Buyer Indemnitees on
account of such Loss under any insurance policy of any of the Companies that
existed prior to the Closing and (ii) the Tax benefit actually realized by the
Buyer Indemnitees on account of the portion of such Loss paid by Sellers, as
reduced by clause (i) of this _Section 11.3(e)_, in the year such Loss
occurs and the subsequent two years, whether realized by way of a refund,
credit or reduction in Tax due by a Buyer Indemnitee or any of
its Affiliates, but only with respect to the portion of such Loss that falls
within the aggregate claim thresholds set forth in _Section 11.3(b)_. Buyer
will use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue the insurance proceeds
referred to in _Section 11.3(e)(i)_. In computing the amount of any such Tax
benefits, the Buyer Indemnitees shall be deemed to recognize all other items
of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any items
arising from the incurrence of the Loss for which indemnification is provided
under this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a Buyer Indemnitees
shall be deemed to have "realized" a reduction in Taxes to the extent that,
and at such time, as the amount of Taxes (i) payable by the Buyer Indemnitee
is reduced below the amount of Taxes that the Buyer Indemnitee would have
been required to pay but for the incurrence of the Loss such amount for which
indemnification is provided under this Agreement, or (ii) refunded or
credited to the Buyer Indemnitee is increased above the amount of Taxes that
would have been refunded or credited to the Buyer Indemnitee but for the
incurrence of the Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement.   

(f) After the Closing, other than the equitable remedies set forth in _Section
13.8_, the remedies set forth in _Sections 11.1_ and _11.2_ will be the sole
and exclusive remedies with respect to any Losses arising from the breach of
any covenant, representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in
_Articles 3_ and _4_ of this Agreement (other than to the extent any such
claims are grounded in fraud).   

(g) The provisions of this _Article 11_ shall apply in such a manner as not
to give duplicative effect to any item of adjustment. If, under _Section
2.5(g)_, there has been an adjustment to the Purchase Price for any Losses,
there shall not be any charge against the Escrow Fund or the deductible
provided in _Section 11.1(b)_ and the Buyer may claim a breach of
any representation or warranty with respect to any such Losses that gave rise
to such adjustment in the Purchase Price.   

(h) The right to indemnification under this _Article 11_ will apply only to
those claims for indemnification that are given before the applicable
Expiration Date in accordance with  _Section 11.4_ or _Section 11.5_, as
applicable.   

(i) Despite anything to the contrary in this _Article 11_, any
indemnification obligations of any of the Sellers to any of the Buyer
Indemnities shall be first paid from the Escrow Funds subject to the Escrow
Agreement. After the Escrow Funds are exhausted, the Sellers will be jointly
and severally liable to the Buyer Indemnities for all of their
indemnification obligations to the Buyer Indemnities under this _Article
11_, subject to the limitations contained in other Sections of this _Article
11_.   

     11.4  |   | NOTICE AND OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND  
---|---|--- 
     

(a) Within 10 days after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity under
_Sections 11.1_ or _11.2_ (an " _Indemnified Person_ ") of notice of the
assertion of a third-party claim against it, the Indemnified Person will, if
a claim is to be made against a Person obligated to indemnify under such
Section (an " _Indemnifying Person_ "), give notice (" _Claim Notice_ ") to
the Indemnifying Person (who, in the case of the Sellers, will be, for
purposes of this _Section 11.4_, the Sellers Representative) of the
assertion of such claim. A Claim Notice must describe such claim in
reasonable detail and must indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary and
to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by
the Indemnified Person. An Indemnified Persons failure to give a Claim
Notice to an Indemnifying Person within such 10 day period will not relieve
the Indemnifying Person of any Liability that it may have to the Indemnified
Person, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person demonstrates that
the resolution of such claim is prejudiced by the Indemnified Persons failure
to give such notice.   

(b) If any claim referred to in _Section 11.4(a)_ is brought against an
Indemnified Person by means of a Proceeding, then the Indemnifying Person
will be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent that it
wishes, to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel satisfactory to
the Indemnified Person (unless (i) the Indemnifying Person is also a party to
such Proceeding and the Indemnified Person determines in good faith that joint
representation would be inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnifying Person fails
to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Person of its financial
capacity to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification with respect
to such Proceeding) by providing notice (" _Response_ ") to the Indemnified
Person within 10 days after receiving a Claim Notice that it will assume such
defense. The Response must clearly state whether the Indemnifying Person is
(A) conceding that claims made in that Proceeding are within the scope of and
subject to indemnification hereunder in which case it will be conclusively
established for purposes of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements that
they are or (B) reserving its determination as to whether claims made in that
Proceeding are within the scope of and subject to indemnification hereunder.
If the Indemnifying Person assumes such defense subject to such reservation,
then within 15 days of providing the Indemnified Person with a Response, it
must provide a second notice to the Indemnified Person stating whether it is
conceding that claims made in that Proceeding are within the scope of and
subject to indemnification. If the Indemnified Person concedes that claims
made in that Proceeding are within the scope of and subject to
indemnification, then it will be conclusively established for purposes of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements that they are. After any notice from
the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person of its concession that the
claims made are within the scope of and subject to indemnification, the
Indemnifying Person will not, as long as it diligently conducts such
defense, be liable to the Indemnified Person under this _Article 11_ for any
fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of
such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person
in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, other than reasonable
costs of investigation, provided, however, that the Indemnifying Person shall
be liable for any fees of counsel and any other expenses with respect to the
defense of such Proceeding incurred by the Indemnified Person until such time
as this notice was provided. The Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the
defense of any such Proceeding, may not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any such Proceeding that (i) does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the
Indemnified Party a complete release from all liability in respect of the
claim underlying such Proceeding, (ii) grants any injunctive or equitable
relief or (iii) may reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the
affected business of the Indemnified Party.   

(c) If a Claim Notice is given to an Indemnifying Person of the commencement
of any Proceeding and the Indemnifying Person does not, within 10 days after
the Indemnified Persons Claim Notice is given, give a Response to the
Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding,
then the Indemnifying Person will be bound by any determination made in such
Proceeding or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified
Person.   

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Proceeding may adversely
affect it or its affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for
which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, then the
Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying Person, assume
the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Proceeding, but the
Indemnifying Person will not be bound by any determination of a Proceeding so
defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which
may not be unreasonably withheld).   

     11.5  |   | PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATIONOTHER CLAIMS  
---|---|--- 
     

A party may assert a claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a
third-party claim by providing notice to the party obligated to indemnify
such party.   

     11.6  |   | TAX REPORTING  
---|---|--- 
     

For Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat, and cause each of their
Affiliates to treat, any indemnification payment under this Article 11 as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by Law. The Parties
and their Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
this _Section 11.6_, and shall not take any position contrary thereto
except as required by Law.   

ARTICLE 12    

SELLERS REPRESENTATIVE    

     12.1  |   | APPOINTMENT AND POWERS  
---|---|--- 
     

The Sellers hereby irrevocably confirm, designate and appoint Lisa Downs as
their representative, agent and attorney-in-fact (the " _Sellers 
Representative_"), with exclusive power and authority to act for and on
behalf of each Seller after the Closing in connection with this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements, including:   

(a) all matters arising under or relating to this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, including all disputes relating hereto and thereto or arising
here from and therefrom;   

(b) the execution, delivery and receipt on behalf of the Sellers of all
notices, consents, waivers and other communications required or permitted to
be given or received under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements after
the Closing Date;   

(c) receiving disbursements and payments for distribution to the
Sellers;   

(d) taking all other actions and make all other decisions that this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements requires or permits the Sellers Representative
to take or make; and   

(e) receiving service of process or other notice for each Seller.   

This appointment and grant of authority to the Sellers Representative (a) is
coupled with an interest, such that it is irrevocable and may not be
terminated by the act of any Seller, or by operation of Law, whether upon the
death, incapacity or insolvency of any Seller or by the occurrence of any
other event and (b) will be binding upon the executors, heirs,
legal representatives and successors of each Seller. All actions and
decisions of the Sellers Representative pursuant to this _Section 12.1_
will be binding upon each Seller, and no Seller will have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest such actions
or decisions.   

     12.2  |   | SUCCESSORS  
---|---|--- 
     

If the Sellers Representative dies, resigns or becomes incapacitated such
that she cannot perform her responsibilities hereunder, then Maribeth R.
Gentry will immediately succeed her as the Sellers Representative without
the necessity of any action by any party. If Maribeth R. Gentry refuses to
perform the duties of the Sellers Representative, dies, resigns or
becomes incapacitated such that she cannot perform her responsibilities
hereunder, then a majority of the proportionate interests of the Sellers (as
set forth on _Schedule 2.2(a)_) will select another representative to fill
such vacancy and such substituted representative will be deemed to be the
Sellers Representative for all purposes under this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Sellers may replace the
Sellers Representative by election of a majority of the proportionate
interests of the Sellers (as set forth on _Schedule 2.2(a)_), provided,
however that the replacement of the Sellers Representative will be effective
only upon notice to the Buyer of such replacement.   

     12.3  |   | FEES AND EXPENSES  
---|---|--- 
     

All fees, expenses and Liabilities incurred by the Sellers Representative
after the Closing Date in connection with the performance of his duties
hereunder will be paid severally by the Sellers in proportion to their
respective ownership of the Shares. No Seller will seek reimbursement or
indemnification for such fees, expenses or Liabilities or otherwise from
any Company or the Buyer.   

     12.4  |   | RELIANCE  
---|---|--- 
     

The Buyer and the Escrow Agent will be entitled to rely upon any document
delivered by the Sellers Representative as (a) being genuine and correct and
(b) having been duly signed or sent by the Sellers Representative, and
neither the Buyer nor the Escrow Agent will be liable to any Seller for any
action taken or omitted by the Buyer or the Escrow Agent in such
reliance.   

     12.5  |   | NO LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION  
---|---|--- 
     

The Sellers agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Sellers Representative from and against any and all Losses that
may be incurred by the Sellers Representative arising out of or in
connection with its appointment as the Sellers Representative under this
Agreement (except such as may result from the Sellers Representatives
willful violation of Law or gross negligence in the performance of his duties
under this Agreement), including the legal costs of defending against any
claim or liability in connection with his performance under this Agreement
and all other documents and agreements executed and delivered by the Sellers
Representative in connection with this Agreement.   

ARTICLE 13    

GENERAL PROVISIONS

     13.2  |   | FURTHER ASSURANCES  
---|---|--- 
     

The parties agree (a) to furnish upon request to each other such further
information, (b) to execute and deliver to each other such other documents
and (c) to do such other acts and things, all as the other party may
reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of
this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions.   

     13.3  |   | INCORPORATION OF SCHEDULES  
---|---|--- 
     

The Schedules identified in this Agreement, including the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule and the Buyers Disclosure Schedule, are incorporated herein by
reference and made a part of this Agreement.   

     13.4  |   | ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND MODIFICATION  
---|---|--- 
     

Other than (i) the Non-Disclosure Agreement by and among Techni-Core, MPC and
the Buyer dated as of June 2, 2008 and (ii) the Joint Defense Common Interest
Agreements by and among Buyer and the Companies effective as of July 10,
2008, this Agreement supersedes all prior agreements among the parties, with
respect to its subject matter (including the Letter of Intent among the Buyer,
MPC, Techni-Core and the Techni-Core Shareholders dated as of July 23, 2008)
and this Agreement constitutes (along with the Schedules, Ancillary
Agreements and other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement) a
complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between
the parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may not be
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except by a written agreement
executed by the party to be charged with the modification.   

     13.5  |   | DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES  
---|---|--- 
     

The statements in the Sellers Disclosure Schedule and the Buyers Disclosure
Schedule, and those in any supplement thereto, relate only to the provisions
in the Section of the Agreement to which they expressly relate and not to any
other provision. If there is any inconsistency between the statements in the
body of this Agreement and those in the Sellers Disclosure Schedule or
the Buyers Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be (other than an exception
expressly set forth as such in the relevant disclosure schedule with respect
to a specifically identified representation or warranty), then the statements
in the body of this Agreement will control.   

     13.6  |   | SEVERABILITY  
---|---|--- 
     

If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any
court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will
remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid
or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect
to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.   

     13.7  |   | ASSIGNMENTS, SUCCESSORS AND NO THIRD PARTY RIGHTS  
---|---|--- 
     

No party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding
in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of each of the partys
successors, permitted assigns, heirs, executors and administrators. Nothing
expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any
Person, other than the parties to this Agreement, any legal or equitable
right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any
provision of this Agreement except such rights as will inure to a successor or
permitted assignee pursuant to this _Section 13.7_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Buyer may, and after the Closing the Company may,
assign any or all of its rights hereunder and under the Ancillary Agreements
to its lenders as collateral security, provided, however, that no bank
assignee shall have any right to enforce any payment, indemnification or other
obligation of the Sellers hereunder, other than a bank assignee of the Buyer
agreed to by the Sellers Representative.   

     13.8  |   | ENFORCEMENT OF AGREEMENT  
---|---|--- 
     

The Sellers acknowledge and agree that the Buyer would be damaged irreparably
if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with the specific terms, and that any breach of this Agreement by any Seller
would not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone.
Accordingly, the Sellers agree that, in addition to any other right or remedy
to which the Buyer may be entitled, at law or in equity, it will be entitled
to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific
performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of
this Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking.   

     13.9  |   | WAIVER  
---|---|--- 
     

The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and
not alternative. Neither any failure nor any delay by any party in exercising
any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or any of the documents
referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power,
or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power,
or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right,
power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege.
To the maximum extent permitted by Law, (a) no claim or right arising out of
this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement can be
discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of
the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver
that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific
instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party
will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that party or of the right
of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without
notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to
in this Agreement.   

     13.10  |   | GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS  
---|---|--- 
     

This Agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State
of Delaware without regard to conflicts of laws principles that would require
the application of any other Law. The parties hereto hereby declare that it
is their intention that this Agreement will be regarded as made under the
laws of the State of Delaware and that the laws of the State of Delaware will
be applied in interpreting its provisions in all cases where legal
interpretation will be required. Each of the parties hereto agrees (a) that
this Agreement involves at least $100,000.00. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to be subject to the
jurisdiction of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois,
provided, however, if any action is brought or heard in a court other than
the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the action shall be
immediately transferred to the Chancery Court for the State of Delaware.
(1) To the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process
in the States of Delaware and Illinois, to appoint and maintain an agent in
the States of Delaware and Illinois as such partys agent for acceptance of
legal process and (2) that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, service
of process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a
proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service
constituting evidence of valid service, and that service made pursuant to (1)
or (2) above will, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, have the same
legal force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the
State of Delaware or the State of Illinois, as applicable. Any Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement must be brought in the courts of
the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois or the State of
Delaware, County of New Castle and each of the parties irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such Proceeding, waives
any objection it may now or hereafter have to venue or to convenience of
forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Proceeding will be heard and
determined only in any such court and agrees not to bring any Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Any party may
file a copy of this paragraph with any court as written evidence of the
knowing, voluntary and bargained agreement amongst the parties irrevocably to
waive any objections to venue or to convenience of forum. In connection with
any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the non-
prevailing party will pay all of the fees, costs and expenses, including
without limitation the reasonable attorneys fees and costs of investigation
of the prevailing party.   

     13.11  |   | COUNTERPARTS  
---|---|--- 
     

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which will
be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when
taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement.
