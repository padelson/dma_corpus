Therefore, (i) Stock Consideration otherwise issuable pursuant to Section 2.6(b)     ##### 

  

    

in exchange for shares of Unvested Company Common Stock shall not
automatically be issued by Parent or Exchange Agent to such holder at the
Effective Time, and shall instead be issued by Parent or Exchange Agent on the

vested (if at all) under the vesting schedule in place for such shares
immediately prior to or at the Effective Time (subject to the restrictions
and other terms of such vesting schedule) and (ii) Cash
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.6(b) in exchange for
shares of Unvested Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "Unvested Cash") shall not automatically be
paid by Parent or Exchange Agent to such holder at the Effective Time,
and shall instead be paid out by Parent or Exchange Agent to such holder on
the date that such shares of Unvested Company Common Stock would have become
vested under the vesting schedule in place for such shares immediately prior
to or at the Effective Time (subject to the restrictions and other terms of
such vesting schedule), less the amount of such newly Vested Cash which vests
in escrow in accordance with Section 2.6(e); _provided, however_ , that
Parent may in its discretion make all such required payments to holders of
Unvested Cash on the last business day of each calendar month during which
vesting occurs for administrative convenience. All amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 2.6(f) shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and
shall be paid without interest. A portion of such newly Vested Cash so
distributed will be treated as imputed interest to the extent required under
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. All outstanding rights
to repurchase shares of Unvested Company Common Stock that the Company may
hold or similar restrictions in the Companys favor immediately prior to the
Effective Time (all such rights, the "Repurchase Rights") shall be assigned
to Parent in the Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon
the same terms and subject to the same conditions that were in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms of the
applicable agreement, except that Repurchase Rights may be exercised by
Parent retaining the Unvested Cash and Unvested Parent Common Stock into
which such shares of the Company Unvested Common Stock have been converted and
paying to the former holder thereof the repurchase price in effect for each
such share subject to that Repurchase Right immediately prior to the

sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by operation of law), by

 (g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any Merger Consideration otherwise payable or issuable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Capital Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any applicable provision of federal, local or foreign Tax law or under any applicable legal requirement. Any such deduction shall be withheld first from the Cash Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement and, to     ##### 

  

    

the extent that such cash amounts are insufficient, from the Stock
Consideration issuable pursuant to this Agreement, it being understood and
hereby agreed that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be so
deducted from the Stock Consideration shall be determined by dividing the
amount required to be so deducted or withheld by the closing price of one
share of Parent Common Stock on The Nasdaq National Market on the last full
trading day prior to the Closing. To the extent such amounts are so deducted
or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.    

 (h) _No Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each Company Stockholder and each Company Optionholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (determined after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise be receivable by such Company Stockholder or Company Optionholder pursuant to the Merger in respect of all shares of Company Capital Stock held by such Company Stockholder or issuable upon exercise of Company Options by a Company Optionholder) shall, upon surrender of such holders Company Stock Certificates or exercise of such Company Optionholders Company Option, be entitled to receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) such fraction by (y) the Parent Trading Price.    

 2.7 _Dissenting Shares for Holders of Company Capital Stock_.   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to contrary set forth in this Agreement, any shares of Company Capital Stock that are held by a holder who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such holders appraisal, dissenters or similar rights for such shares under Delaware Law or California Law ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration payable and issuable in respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to this Agreement, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by Delaware Law and/or California Law, as applicable.    

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.7(a), if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his, her or its appraisal or dissenters rights, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders Dissenting Shares shall then cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable or issuable in respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to this Agreement, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares.    

 (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for dissenters rights received by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of Delaware Law and/or California Law, as applicable, and (ii) the opportunity     #####

demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent or if directed to do so by a court order or judgment, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle
any such demands. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Parent or

any Dissenting Shares in excess of the Merger Consideration that otherwise
would have been payable or issuable in respect of such shares under this
Agreement, or (ii) incurs any other costs or expenses in respect of any
Dissenting Shares (excluding payments for such shares) (together

amount equal to the portion of the Cash Consideration to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement (without interest), less such holders

 (h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_.

intent to take such actions, and (6) prior to or contemporaneously
with delivering or making available any such nonpublic information to such

The Companys obligation to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall not be limited to or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or any subsequent action by the Companys Board of Directors.    

 (b) (i) The Companys Board of Directors shall unanimously recommend (acting without the participation of David Strohm) that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement; (ii) subject to the provisions of the second sentence of this Section 6.2(b), any information statement or other disclosure document distributed to the Company Stockholders in connection with this transaction shall include a statement to the effect that the Companys Board of Directors has unanimously recommended (acting without the participation of David Strohm) that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of and approve and adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger; and (iii) subject to the provisions of the second sentence of this Section 6.2(b), neither the Companys Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the unanimous (acting without the participation of David Strohm) recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to receipt by the Company of the Requisite Stockholder Approval approving the Merger and adopting this Agreement, the Companys Board of Directors may withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation to the Company Stockholders if (i) it receives an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal and reasonably concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated (taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal, the likelihood of the proposal being financed and the Person making the proposal), and would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the Company Stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger and (ii) it reasonably concludes in good faith (following the receipt     ##### 

  

    

of advice from outside counsel) that modification or withdrawal of its
recommendation is required in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations
to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law and California Law, as
applicable (a "Superior Proposal").

 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 6.3(a), the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of any parties to any Contracts to which the Company is a party (including all consents, waivers and approvals set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule) as are required thereunder in connection with the Merger in order to ensure that all such Contracts remain in full force and effect from and after the Effective Time in accordance with their respective terms and to preserve all rights of, and benefits to, Parent and the Surviving Corporation under such Contracts from and after the Effective Time. All such consents, waivers and approvals shall be in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent. In the event that the other parties to any such Contract, including any lessor or licensor of any Leased Real Property, conditions its grant of a consent, waiver or approval (including by threatening to exercise a "recapture" or other termination right) upon the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration, including increased rent payments or other payments under the Contract, (i) the Company shall not make or commit to make any such payment or provide any such consideration without Parents prior written consent, and (ii) any such payment shall be deemed to be a Transaction Expense for all purposes of and under this Agreement.    

 6.4 _Regulatory Approvals_.   

 (a) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent shall promptly execute and file, or join in the execution and filing of, any application, notification or other document that may be necessary in order to obtain the authorization, approval or consent of any Governmental Authority, whether federal, state, local or foreign, that may be reasonably required, or that Parent may reasonably request, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain all such authorizations, approvals and consents. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly inform the other of any material communication between the Company or Parent (as applicable) and any Governmental Authority regarding the     ##### 

  

    

transactions contemplated hereby. If the Company or Parent or any affiliate
thereof shall receive any formal or informal request for supplemental
information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, then the Company or Parent
(as applicable) shall make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable, a response in compliance with such request. Each of
the Company and Parent shall direct, in its sole discretion, the making of
such response, but shall consider in good faith the views of the
other.    

 (b) Without limiting the generality or effect of Section 6.4(a), each of the Company and Parent shall, as soon as practicable, and in any event no later than ten (10) business days after the date hereof, make any initial filings required under the HSR Act. The parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other federal or state antitrust or fair trade law. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the Antitrust Laws. In connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent (each an _"_ Order _"_ ), that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the Merger or any such other transactions, unless the Company and Parent shall agree in writing that litigation is not in their respective best interests. Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, it is expressly understood and agreed that neither the Company nor Parent shall have any obligation to litigate any administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any Order beyond the earlier of (i) sixty (60) days after the date hereof and (ii) the date of a ruling preliminarily enjoining the Merger issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement.

capital stock or of any business, assets or property of Parent, or of the
Company or its affiliates, or the imposition of any limitation on the ability
of any of them to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of
such assets, properties and stock, or (ii) take any action under this Section
6.4, Section 6.3 or any other provision of this Agreement if any Governmental
Authority that has the authority to enforce any Antitrust Law seeks, or
authorizes its staff to seek, a preliminary injunction or restraining order to
enjoin consummation of the Merger.    

 6.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Effective Time, and (b) any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (x) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would cause any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Effective Time, and (y) any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall not (i) limit or otherwise affect any remedies otherwise available to Parent or the Company, as applicable, or (ii) constitute an acknowledgment or admission of a breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by the Company pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall affect or be deemed to modify, amend or supplement any representation or warranty set forth herein, the Company Disclosure Schedule or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, or limit any right to indemnification provided herein.   

 6.6 _Access to Information_. During the period from the date hereof and prior to the earlier of the Effective time or the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall afford Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable access during Companys normal business hours to (i) all of the Companys properties, books, Contracts, commitments and records, (ii) all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel (subject to restrictions imposed by applicable law) of the Company as Parent may reasonably request, and (iii) all employees of the Company as identified by Parent. The Company shall provide to Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives copies of internal financial statements (including Tax Returns and supporting documentation) promptly upon request. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify, amend or supplement any representation or warranty set forth herein, the Company Disclosure Schedule or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, or limit any right to indemnification provided herein.    #####

The Company shall deliver the Spreadsheet to Parent at least three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date. In the event that any information in the Spreadsheet becomes inaccurate as a result of the exercise, after delivery of the Spreadsheet to Parent and prior to the Effective Time, of Company Options issued and outstanding as of the date hereof or the conversion of Company Preferred Stock, the Company shall deliver an updated Spreadsheet and certification consistent with the first sentence of this Section 6.7 and such spreadsheet shall be deemed the "Spreadsheet" for all purposes hereunder.   

 6.8 _Transaction Expenses_.

 6.9 _Employment Arrangements_.   

 (a) At the discretion of Parent, certain persons who are employees of the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date may be offered "at-will" employment by Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation (which at-will employment may be for a transitional period), to be effective as of the Closing Date, upon proof of citizenship or appropriate employment authorization from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service or the U.S. Department of State evidencing a right to work in the United States and upon execution of an Employment, Proprietary Information and     ##### 

  

    

Inventions Assignment Agreement in Parents standard form; _provided,
however_ , that Parent shall assume and pay any severance and related costs
(if any) associated with terminating any employees of the Company who are not
offered employment with Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation. Such "at-
will" employment arrangements will (i) be set forth in offer letters (each,
an "Offer Letter"), (ii) have terms, including the position, salary and
responsibilities of such employee, to be determined by Parent in its sole
discretion, and (iii) supersede any prior employment agreements and
other arrangements with such employee in effect prior to the Closing Date.
Each employee of the Company who becomes an employee of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation as of the Closing Date shall be referred to hereafter
as a "Continuing Employee." Continuing Employees shall be eligible to receive
benefits consistent with Parents applicable human resources policies.    

 (b) Effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company and its affiliates, as applicable, shall each terminate any and all group severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements and any and all plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) plans shall not be terminated) (collectively, "Terminated Company Employee Plans"). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than five business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Terminated Company Employee Plan(s) have been terminated (effective no later than the day immediately terminated preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Companys board of directors. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Terminated Company Employee Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require.    

 6.10 _Parent Common Stock Listing_. If required by applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable, and those required to be reserved for issuance, in connection with the Merger to be authorized for listing on the Nasdaq National Market at or prior to the Closing Date.   

 6.11 _Form S-8_. Within five (5) business days after the Closing Date, Parent shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8, if available for use by Parent, registering that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all Company Options assumed by Parent pursuant to this Agreement that are eligible to be registered on Form S-8.   

 6.12 _Employee Benefit Matters_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall permit the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to participate in Parents employee benefit plans for which such individuals are eligible (the "Parent Plans") on terms no less favorable than those provided to    ##### 

  

 

similarly situated employees of Parent or its subsidiaries. Parent shall
recognize the prior service with the Company (or predecessor employers to the
extent the Company provides past service credit) of each of the
Continuing Employees for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
(but not benefit accruals or stock related vesting) under the Parent Plans
and for levels of benefits under Parents vacation and severance policies, if
any. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be waived
any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the
application of any pre-existing condition limitations under the Parent Plans.
This Section 6.12 shall not operate to (a) duplicate any benefit provided to
any Continuing Employee or to fund any such benefit, (b) require Parent
to continue to maintain any severance plan or other employee benefit plan in
effect following the Effective Time for Parents employees, including the
Continuing Employees, or (c) be construed to mean the employment of the
Continuing Employees is not terminable by Parent at will at any time, with or
without cause, for any reason or no reason.    

 6.13 _Section 280G Payments_. If and to the extent necessary, as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall submit to the Company Stockholders for approval (in a manner satisfactory to Parent), by such number of Company Stockholders as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any Section 280G Payments (which initial determination shall be made by the Company and shall be subject to review and approval by Parent), such that such Section 280G Payments shall not be deemed to be Section 280G Payments, and prior to the Effective Time the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence satisfactory to Parent that (a) a Company Stockholder vote was solicited in conformance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite Company Stockholder approval was obtained with respect to any Section 280G Payments that were subject to the Company Stockholder vote, or (b) that the Company Stockholder approval of Section 280G Payments was not obtained and as a consequence, that such payments and/or benefits shall not be made or provided to the extent they would cause any amounts to constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to the waivers of those payments and/or benefits, which were executed by the affected individuals prior to the Company Stockholder vote.   

 6.14 _Rule 145 Affiliates_. Section 6.14 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth those Persons who, in the Companys reasonable judgment, are or may be "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act (each such Person, a "Rule 145 Affiliate"). The Company shall provide Parent such information and documents as Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, as promptly as practicable on or following the date hereof, from each Rule 145 Affiliate who has not delivered a Rule 145 Affiliate Agreement on or prior to the date hereof, an executed Rule 145 Affiliate Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E. Parent and Merger Sub will be entitled to place appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing any Parent Common Stock to be received by a Rule 145 Affiliate pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop transfer    ##### 

  

 

instructions to the transfer agent for Parent Common Stock, consistent with
the terms of each Rule 145 Affiliate Agreement.    

 6.15 _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto, at the request of another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other certificates, instruments, agreements and other documents, and do and perform such other acts and things, as may be reasonably necessary or desirable for purposes of effecting completely the consummation of Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.   

 6.16 _Reorganization Matters_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that it will not engage in any action, or fail to take any action, and will cause its respective subsidiaries not to engage in any action, or fail to take any action, which action or failure to take action would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code.   

 6.17 _Indemnification_. Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to (i) each indemnification agreement in effect between the Company and each person who is a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time and (ii) any indemnification provision under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or equivalent organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement (each of the persons to be indemnified pursuant to the agreements and provisions referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 6.17 shall be referred to as a "Company Indemnified Party"). The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation from liability substantially similar to those set forth in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or equivalent organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time in any manner that would materially adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Company Indemnified Party.   

 6.18 _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that all of the closing conditions have been satisfied other than the receipt of one or more of the consents, waivers, approvals or assignments listed on Schedule 7.2(e), Parent and the Company may mutually agree to merge Merger Sub with and into the Company rather than effecting the Merger as described in Section 2.1 hereof. If Parent and the Company so mutually agree (i) the term "Merger" as used in the Agreement shall refer to the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company; and (ii) the term "Surviving Corporation" shall refer to the Company as the surviving entity after the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company. If, as result of the change in structure described in this Section 6.18, counsel to Parent and the Company are unable to deliver the tax opinions described in Section 7.2(l) and Section 7.3(f), the amount of Cash Consideration shall be reduced and the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock shall be correspondingly increased (by reference to the Parent Trading    ##### 

  

 

Price) to the minimum extent necessary in order to enable the tax opinions
described in Section 7.2(l) and Section 7.3(f) to be rendered.    

 6.19 _Additional Option Grants_. Company shall, within three (3) business days prior to Closing or such later time as directed by Parent, grant additional Company Options in amounts and to Employees out of the Company Plan as directed by Parent.

 (d) Subject to Section 8.3(e) and 8.3(f) below, if the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Indemnified Parties may not recover pursuant to the indemnity set forth in Section 8.2(i) unless and until one or more Officers Certificates identifying Losses in excess of the product of (1) the Escrow Amount multiplied by (2) 0.01, in the aggregate (the "Threshold") has or have been delivered to the Stockholder Representative in accordance with this Agreement, in which case Parent shall be entitled to recover pursuant to the indemnity set forth in Section 8.2(i) all such Losses (including the amount of the Threshold); _provided, however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to indemnification claims under Sections 8.2(ii)-(v).    

 (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit any rights or remedies an Indemnified Party may have under applicable law, whether pursuant to a proceeding at law or equity, against any Person arising out of fraud.    

 (f) It is understood that nothing in this Agreement shall eliminate the ability of any party hereto to apply for equitable remedies to enforce the other parties obligations under this Agreement.    

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that any Indemnified Party may bring a claim for indemnification for any Loss under this Article VIII notwithstanding the fact that any Indemnified Party had knowledge of the breach, event or circumstance giving rise to such Loss prior to the Closing or waived any condition to the Closing related thereto.    

 8.4 _Indemnification Claims_.    ##### 

  

  

 (a) Parent shall give notice of any claim for indemnification under Section 8.2 by delivering an Officers Certificate (as defined below) to the Stockholder Representative, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, for any claim for indemnification, at any time prior to the last day of the Escrow Period. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the term "Officers Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by any officer of Parent: (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, sustained or incurred Losses, or reasonably anticipates that it will pay, sustain or incur Losses, (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Loss included in the amount so stated (and the method of computation of each such item of Loss, if applicable), the date each such item of Loss was paid, sustained or incurred, or the basis for such reasonably anticipated Loss(es), (iii) a brief description in reasonable detail (to the extent available to Parent) of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to each item of Loss based on Parents good faith belief thereof, including the identity and address of any third-party claimant and copies of any formal demand or complaint relating thereto, and (iv) the basis for indemnification under Section 8.2 to which such item of Loss is related (including, if applicable, the specific nature of the misrepresentation, or the breach of warranty or covenant).    

 (b) If the Stockholder Representative shall not object in writing pursuant to Section 8.4(d) to any individual items of Loss set forth in an Officers Certificate delivered by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a) within thirty (30) calendar days after the Stockholder Representatives receipt of such Officers Certificate, the Stockholder Representative shall be conclusively deemed to have acknowledged and irrevocably consented, for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, (i) to the Indemnified Party recovery of the full amount of all such items of Loss set forth in such Officers Certificate solely to the extent that such Losses do not exceed the Escrow Amount at such time, and (ii) if and to the extent necessary, and without further notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a final judgment for damages against the Indemnifying Parties for such items of Loss in any court having competent jurisdiction over the matter. Upon receipt of any Officers Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall not release any portion of the Escrow Amount to Parent or any other Indemnified Party or Parties pursuant to this Agreement unless and until (i) the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the Stockholder Representative to release any portion of the Escrow Amount, or (ii) the Stockholder Representative shall have failed to object in writing pursuant to Section 8.4(d) to any individual items of Loss set forth in such Officers Certificate within thirty (30) calendar days after the Stockholder Representatives receipt of such Officers Certificate.    

 (c) In the event that the Escrow Agent shall receive written authorization from the Stockholder Representative to release to Parent or any other Indemnified Party or Parties any portion of the Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 8.4(b), the Escrow Agent shall release such portion of the Escrow Amount in accordance with such written instructions. In the event that the Stockholder Representative shall have failed to object in writing pursuant to Section 8.4(d) to any individual items of Loss set forth in an Officers Certificate relating to a claim for indemnification pursuant to     ##### 

  

    

Section 8.2 within thirty (30) calendar days after the
Stockholder Representatives receipt of such Officers Certificate, the
Escrow Agent shall promptly release to Parent or any other Indemnified Party
or Parties (as instructed by Parent in writing) an amount of cash equal to
the amount of all such items of Loss specified in such Officers Certificate
with respect to which the Stockholder Representative has not objected in
writing pursuant to Section 8.4(d). Any cash released to Parent or any other
Indemnified Party or Parties pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
deemed to reduce each Indemnifying Partys interest in the Escrow Fund in
accordance with his, her or its Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund.    

 (d) In the event that the Stockholder Representative shall seek to contest any individual items of Loss set forth in an Officers Certificate received from Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(b), the Stockholder Representative shall notify Parent in writing, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of such Officers Certificate, of the Stockholders Representatives objection, which notice shall set forth a brief description in reasonable detail of the Stockholder Representatives basis for objecting to each item of Loss based on the Stockholder Representatives good faith belief thereof. Upon Parents receipt of a written notice of objection from the Stockholder Representative pursuant to the preceding sentence, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to the disputed items of Loss. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth the agreement reached by the parties with respect to such disputed items of Loss shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a claim against the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the instructions set forth in any such memorandum.    

 (e) If within sixty (60) days after the Stockholder Representatives receipt of such Officers Certificate, and after good faith negotiations, the parties are unable to agree on the rights of the respective parties with respect to any disputed items of Loss set forth in an Officers Certificate, either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may bring suit in the courts of the State of California and the Federal courts of the United States of America, in each case, located within the county of Santa Clara in the State of California to resolve the matter. The decision of the trial court as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officers Certificate shall be nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and the Escrow Agent shall distribute the Escrow Amount in accordance therewith. Judgment upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.    

 (f) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third-party claim which Parent reasonably believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund or for other indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative of such claim, and the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, at its sole option and expense, to     ##### 

  

    

participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such claim.
If there is a third party claim that, if adversely determined would give rise
to a right of recovery for Losses hereunder, then any amounts incurred by the
Indemnified Parties in defense of such third-party claim, regardless of the
outcome of such claim, shall be deemed Losses hereunder. Parent shall have
the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle,
any such claim; _provided, however_ , that except with the consent of
the Stockholder Representative, no settlement of any such claim with third-
party claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Losses relating to
such matter or whether the Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification hereunder with respect thereto. In the event that the
Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement, the
Indemnifying Parties shall have no power or authority to object under any
provision of this Article VIII to the amount of any claim by Parent against
the Escrow Fund with respect to such settlement.    

 8.5 _Escrow Arrangements_.   

 (a) _Escrow Fund_. The Escrow Amount shall constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be governed by the terms set forth herein. The Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate the Indemnified Parties for any indemnification claims arising under Sections 8.2.    

 (b) _Escrow Periods; Distribution of Escrow Funds upon Termination of Escrow Period_. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence immediately following the Effective Time. An amount equal to fifty percent of the Escrow Amount (less any amount which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, is necessary to satisfy any unresolved claims specified in any Officers Certificate that is delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the First Escrow Release with respect to facts and circumstances existing on or prior to the First Escrow Release) shall be released from the Escrow Fund as promptly as practicable after (and in any event no later than at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on the fifth (5th) business day following) the one year anniversary of the Effective Time (the "First Escrow Release"). Any and all amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund (less any amount which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, is necessary to satisfy any unresolved claims specified in any Officers Certificate that is delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the Survival Date with respect to facts and circumstances existing on or prior to the Survival Date) shall be released from the Escrow Fund as promptly as practicable after (and in any event no later than at 5:00 p.m., Pacific time on the fifth (5th) business day after) the Survival Date (such eighteen-month period, the "Escrow Period"). Following the termination of the Escrow Period, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to each of the Indemnifying Parties such Persons Pro Rata Portion (if any) of the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy any then pending claims against the Escrow Fund, and shall deliver to each of the Indemnifying Parties such Persons Pro Rata Portion (if any) of the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund, if any, following resolution of all such claims.    

 (c) _Protection of Escrow Fund; Interest in Escrow Fund_.     ##### 

  

     

 (i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and not as the property of Parent (except as otherwise provided in Section 8.6(c)(ii)) and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms of this Article VIII.   

 (ii) The Escrow Fund shall be invested in U.S. Treasury bills with maturities of not more than thirty (30) days and any interest paid on such cash portion of the Escrow Fund shall be added to the Escrow Fund and become a part thereof and available for satisfaction of claims and, if not delivered to Parent in satisfaction of claims for Losses, shall be distributed to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with such Person Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 8.5(b). For any period of time before such U.S. Treasury bills can be purchased by the Escrow Agent or after such bills mature, the Escrow Fund shall be invested in an interest-bearing U.S. Bank money market account of the Escrow Agent and any interest paid on such Escrow Fund shall be added to the Escrow Fund and become a part thereof and available for satisfaction of claims and, if not delivered to Parent in satisfaction of claims for Losses, shall be distributed to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with such Person Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 8.5(b). The parties hereto agree that Parent is the owner of any cash in the Escrow Fund, and that all interest on or other taxable income, if any, earned from the investment of such cash pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for tax purposes as earned by Parent, and that Parent shall be entitled to a distribution from the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to 5% of such income, which shall be remitted to the Parent by Escrow Agent on a quarterly basis.   

 (d) _Escrow Agent_.    

 (i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any additional written escrow instructions that the Escrow Agent may receive after the date of this Agreement that are signed by an officer of Parent and the Stockholder Representative, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith.   

 (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other Person, excepting only orders or processes of courts of law or the arbitrator or arbitrators selected and authorized to act pursuant to Section 8.4(e), and is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court or the arbitrator or arbitrators selected and authorized to act pursuant to Section 8.4(e). In the event that the Escrow Agent shall obey or comply with any such order, judgment or decree of any court    ##### 

  

 

or the arbitrator or arbitrators selected and authorized to act pursuant
to Section 8.4(e), the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties
hereto or to any other Person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding
any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered
without jurisdiction.    

 (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder.   

 (iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.   

 (v) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses or expenses, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement of affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel in connection with performing the Escrow Agents duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the authority of any Person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.   

 (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all documents and the Escrow Fund and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agents discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damages. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and the Escrowed Amount and Subject Dispute Escrowed Cash held in escrow at any time, except all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action and which the parties jointly and severally agree to pay. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent shall be    ##### 

  

 

fully released and discharged of and from all obligations and
liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.    

 (vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, including allocated costs of in-house counsel and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties under this Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving its subject matter, other than those arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent.   

 (viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty (30) days written notice to the Parent and the Stockholder Representative; _provided, however_ , that no such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as follows: Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use their reasonable best efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the State of California. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally named as escrow agent hereunder. Upon appointment of a successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and liability under this Agreement.   

 (e) _Escrow Agent Fees_. All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties hereunder shall be paid by Parent in accordance with the standard fee schedule of the Escrow Agent. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if the parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated by Parent for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys fees, including allocated costs of in-house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or litigation.    

 (f) _Successor Escrow Agents_. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent in     ##### 

  

    

its individual capacity may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under
this Escrow Agreement without further act.    

 8.6 _Stockholder Representative_.   

 (a) In the event that this Agreement is adopted by the Company Stockholders, effective upon such vote, and without any further action of any Indemnifying Party, Dan Avida shall be appointed as the Indemnifying Parties agent and attorney-in-fact as the Stockholder Representative for and on behalf of to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize payment to Parent from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of either of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the Indemnifying Parties from time to time upon not less than fifteen (15) days prior written notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that the Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless holders of at least a majority of the interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of Stockholder Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Indemnifying Parties. The Indemnifying Parties shall, based on their Pro Rata Portions of the Escrow Fund, be responsible for the payment of all fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Stockholder Representative in performing its duties under this Agreement, and the Stockholder Representative shall have the right to have any such fees and expenses reimbursed from the Escrow Fund prior to any distribution to the Indemnified Parties of any amounts in the Escrow Fund, to the extent available.    

 (b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith, and any act done or omitted to be done pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Indemnifying Parties on whose behalf the Escrow Amount was contributed to the Escrow Fund shall indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholder Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Stockholder Representative.    

 (c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative shall constitute a decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Indemnifying Parties; and the Escrow Agent and Parent     ##### 

  

    

may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow Agent and Parent are
hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative.
