Indemnity Escrow and the amounts available under the Indemnity Policy, shall, to the extent
provided in this <U>Article&nbsp;VII</U> be indemnified and held harmless from and against, any and all
claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of actions, losses, costs, damages, liabilities and
out-of-pocket expenses incurred or paid, including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, costs of
investigation or settlement, other professionals&#146; and experts&#146; fees, court or arbitration costs and
Taxes of or with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or of or with respect to any
other member of the same consolidated group, or any of their respective predecessors) paid or
payable after the Effective Time but specifically excluding consequential damages, lost profits,
indirect damages, punitive damages, exemplary damages and any Taxes incurred as a result of any
recovery received under this <U>Article&nbsp;VII</U> (any and all such amounts subject to
indemnification hereunder, being hereinafter collectively referred to as &#147;<U>Damages</U>&#148;), to the
extent such Damages arise out of or result from, in connection with, or by virtue of (i)&nbsp;any
inaccuracy or misrepresentation in any of the representations or warranties given or made by the
Company in this Agreement (other than <U>Section&nbsp;3.20</U> and <U>Section&nbsp;3.23</U>), as qualified

misrepresentation, or (ii)&nbsp;any breach by the Shareholder Representative of any covenant set forth
in this Agreement, any Unpaid Company Transaction Expense to the extent it is not actually
reflected in the Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses used to determine the Merger Consideration, or
any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in the Company&#146;s representation and warranty in <U>Section
3.20</U> or <U>Section&nbsp;3.23</U>, as qualified by the Schedules hereto, or the facts or
circumstances constituting any such inaccuracy or misrepresentation (collectively, &#147;<U>Company

Claim as consequential damages, lost profits, indirect damages, punitive damages or exemplary
damages to any Person who is neither a Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person (as
the case may be) nor an Affiliate thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, no Buyer Indemnified Person
will be entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;7.1</U> for any Damages to the extent such amount is
actually reflected in the Net Closing Indebtedness, Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses or Closing
Working Capital used to determine the Merger Consideration. The Company will not be obligated to
indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Person for any Damages relating to any inaccuracy,
misrepresentation or breach of which Parent had actual knowledge on the date hereof, as and only to
