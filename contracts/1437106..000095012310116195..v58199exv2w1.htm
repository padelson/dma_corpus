upon the exercise of such Common Stock Equivalent exceeded the Closing Date
Share Amount with respect to a share of Common Stock 

   ##### 

  

  

       |   | in each case payable in accordance with and subject to,

_Stock Certificate_ ") or Common Stock Equivalents (" _Common Stock
Equivalent Documents_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the Applicable Share Amount for such shares of Common Stock or for the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents,
payable in accordance with and subject to this _Article II_. The holders of
such shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (each a " _Company
Holder_ ") shall from and after the Effective Time cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents,
except as otherwise provided herein or by the TBOC. In addition, all shares
of the Companys Class B Common Stock, if any, and all shares of the
Companys Series A Preferred Stock, if any, shall, as of the Effective Time,
cease to be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, without any consideration therefor, and each
certificate, instrument or agreement evidencing any such shares shall be null
and void. 

   

 (b) _Dissenters  Rights_. 

   

 (i) No later than ten days following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall mail to each record holder of Common Stock who is entitled to vote on the Merger and who does not consent in writing to the Merger, via first class United States mail, postage prepaid, at the address for each record holder as it appears in the Companys books and records, written notice of such holders appraisal rights and notice that the Merger was approved by the requisite action of the holders of Common Stock pursuant to Sections 6.202(d), 10.353, 10.354 and 10.355 of the TBOC (the " _Notice_ "). Promptly following its receipt thereof, the Surviving Corporation shall give Parent written notice of any demands for appraisal pursuant to Sections 10.353 and 10.354 of the TBOC received by the Surviving Corporation, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the TBOC and received by the Surviving Corporation in connection therewith. Each holder of Common Stock who has perfected the right, if any, for appraisal of such holders outstanding shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.354 and 10.356 of the TBOC and who has not withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal is referred to herein as a "Dissenting Holder" and each share of Common Stock held by a Dissenting Holder is referred to herein as a "Dissenting Share." On the 21st day after the date of the Notice, the Surviving Corporation shall provide to Shareholder Representative and Parent a list of all Dissenting Holders, stating the number of Dissenting Shares held by each Dissenting Holder and the aggregate number of Dissenting Shares, and, within three Business Days after receipt of such list, the Shareholder Representative shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the product of the Closing Date Share Amount multiplied by the aggregate number of Dissenting Shares. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no outstanding  shares of Common Stock that are held immediately prior to the Effective Time by Dissenting Holders shall be converted into or represent a right to receive the Applicable Share Amount, but the Dissenting Holders shall only be entitled, in lieu thereof, to receive payment of the fair value of their Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC. If a holder of outstanding shares of Common Stock who demands appraisal of such shares under the TBOC shall thereafter effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal with respect to such  shares, then each such share shall be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, into and represent only the right to receive the Applicable Share Amount in accordance with this _Section 2.2_, without any interest thereon, upon delivery of a duly completed and validly executed Transmittal Letter and such other documents as may be required pursuant to the instructions thereto, and the surrender of the related Stock Certificate(s) in accordance with _Section 2.5(d)_ (any such holder following the delivery of such items, a " _Formerly Dissenting Holder_ ", and the Dissenting Shares held by such Formerly Dissenting Holder, " _Formerly Dissenting Shares_ "). Promptly following the delivery of such items by a Formerly Dissenting Holder to the Shareholder Representative (prior to the Turnover Date), the Shareholder Representative shall provide written notice to Parent of the receipt of such items from a Formerly Dissenting Holder, and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable but within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, pay to the Shareholder Representative for distribution to such Formerly Dissenting Holder an amount equal to the product of the Closing Date Share Amount multiplied by the number of his or her Formerly Dissenting Shares, _plus_ any Post-Closing Share Amount attributable to such Formerly Dissenting Shares received by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)(ii)_. Formerly Dissenting Holders shall be treated as Company Holders for all purposes of this Agreement, and Formerly Dissenting Shareholders will cease to be treated as Dissenting Shareholders when they become Formerly Dissenting Shareholders. 

   

 (iii) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, if, at the time of any payment (x) to be made to the Shareholder Representative pursuant to Section 2.3(e) or from the Adjustment Escrow or the Indemnity Escrow pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)(ii)_, in each case, for the benefit of the Company Holders or (y) to be made to Company Holders pursuant to _Section 2.5(d)(v)_ from the unused portion of the Sellers Expense Amount, there are Dissenting Holders, then the amount of such payment will be reduced by a fraction thereof, the numerator of which is the number of Dissenting Shares and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, determined as if all Common Stock Equivalents outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time were fully exercisable and had been exercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time but disregarding all Excluded Shares, and the amount by which such payment is so reduced will be retained by or paid instead to the Parent. 

  

 (c) _Treasury Stock; Capital Stock held by Parent_. Any shares of capital stock of the Company held in the treasury of the Company or held by Parent or the Companys or Parents respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no cash or other 

   ##### 

  

 

property shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. Parent shall
cause any Excluded Shares held by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries not to be
Dissenting Shares. 

   

 SECTION 2.3. Calculation of Merger Consideration. 

  

 (a) Not fewer than three Business Days prior to the date hereof, the Company delivered to Parent a statement (the " _Estimate Statement_ ") setting forth the Companys good faith estimates of the amounts of the Closing Working Capital, the Net Closing Indebtedness and the Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, and the amount of the Merger Consideration (the " _Estimated Merger Consideration_ ") based on the foregoing estimates. The Estimate Statement also included the Sellers Expense Amount and the Companys determination of the estimated Closing Date Share Amount based on the Estimated Merger Consideration, the Indemnity Amount, the Adjustment Amount and the Sellers Expense Amount, together with the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Common Stock and the aggregate number of Common Stock Equivalents (and the aggregate exercise prices thereof) used in the determination thereof. The Company has provided to Parent prompt notice and the details of any exercise of Common Stock Equivalents that occurred following the calculation of any amounts included in the Estimate Statement and prior to the Effective Time. To the extent any Common Stock Equivalents have been exercised following Parents receipt of the Estimate Statement, the Estimated Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to give effect to the actual number of Common Stock Equivalents outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time rather than the number of Common Stock Equivalents estimated to be outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time in the Estimate Statement. 

  

 (b) No later than the 90th day after the Closing Date, Parent will prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to the Shareholder Representative a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Parents determination of (i) the actual Closing Working Capital as of the Adjustment Time, (ii) the actual Net Closing Indebtedness as of the Adjustment Time, and (iii) the actual Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses as of the Effective Time. The Closing Statement shall also include the Companys determination of the Merger Consideration and the Closing Date Share Amount, based on the Indemnity Amount, the Adjustment Amount and the Sellers Expense Amount, together with the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Common Stock and the aggregate number of Common Stock Equivalents (and aggregate exercise prices thereof) used in the determination thereof. Parent will prepare, or cause to be prepared, the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (including the determinations included therein) in accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_. 

  

 (c) During the 60-day period immediately following the Shareholder Representatives receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement ( _provided_ that, if Parent fails to deliver the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement within the 90-day period described in  _Section 2.3(b)_, then at the written election of the Shareholder Representative the Estimate Statement will be treated as the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement for purposes of this _Section 2.3_), the Shareholder Representative and its representatives and advisors (i) will be permitted to review, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, the Surviving Corporations and the Company Subsidiaries books and records and their and their outside accountants working papers related or relevant to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet 

   ##### 

  

 

and the Closing Statement (including the determinations included therein), and
(ii) will be given reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice, to knowledgeable employees and accounting
professionals of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Company Subsidiaries in order to facilitate the Shareholder Representatives
review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the review and access described in clauses (i) and (ii) will
be conducted at times and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere
with the operation of Parents, the Surviving Corporations or the
Company Subsidiaries respective businesses. The Closing Balance Sheet and
the Closing Statement (including the determinations included therein) will
become final, binding and conclusive upon Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
the Shareholder Representative and the Company Holders (the " _Interested
Persons_ ") (A) on the 60th day following the Shareholder Representatives
receipt thereof, unless Parent receives from the Shareholder Representative on
or prior to such 60th day written notice of the Shareholder Representatives
disagreement (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") with any account or determination set
forth in the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Statement or (B) on such
earlier date as the Shareholder Representative notifies Parent that it does
not dispute the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement;  _provided_
that, if Parent shall have failed to timely deliver the Closing Balance Sheet
and Closing Statement under _Section 2.3(b)_, the 60th day referred to in
clause (A) above shall refer to the 60th day after the same was due to be
delivered. The Dispute Notice will specify the items in the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Closing Statement disputed by the Shareholder Representative
(collectively, the " _Disputed Items_ "). Any item set forth or reflected on
the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Statement that is not objected to in
the Dispute Notice will be deemed final, binding and conclusive upon the
Interested Persons upon delivery of the Dispute Notice. If the Shareholder
Representative timely delivers the Dispute Notice, then the Closing Balance
Sheet and Closing Statement will become final, binding and conclusive upon
the Interested Persons on the first to occur of (x) the date on which Parent
and the Shareholder Representative resolve in writing all differences they
have with respect to the Disputed Items or (y) the date on which all of the
Disputed Items that are not resolved by Parent and the Shareholder
Representative in writing are finally resolved in writing by the
Independent Accountants in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_. 

   

 (d) During the 30 days following delivery of a Dispute Notice, Parent and the Shareholder Representative will seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the Disputed Items. Any Disputed Item agreed in writing by Parent and the Shareholder Representative will be deemed final, binding and conclusive on the Interested Persons when such written agreement has been entered into by each of Parent and the Shareholder Representative. If Parent and the Shareholder Representative do not reach agreement on all of the Disputed Items during such 30-day period (or such longer period as they shall mutually agree), then at the end of such 30-day (or longer) period Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall submit all unresolved Disputed Items (collectively, the " _Unresolved Items_ ") to Deloitte LLP (the " _Independent Accountants_ ") to review and resolve such matters. The Independent Accountants will determine each Unresolved Item (the amount of which may not be more favorable to Parent than the related amount reflected in the Closing Statement nor more favorable to the Shareholder Representative and the Company Holders than any related amount set forth in the Dispute Notice) in accordance with this _Section 2.3(d)_ and _Section 2.3(f)_ as promptly as may be reasonably practicable, and Parent and the Shareholder Representative will instruct the Independent Accountants to complete such process within a period of no more than 60 days from the date of its engagement. The Independent Accountants 

   ##### 

  

 

shall act as an arbitrator to resolve each Unresolved Item based solely on
written presentations by Parent and the Shareholder Representative and
their respective agents, and not by independent review. Except as Parent and
the Shareholder Representative may otherwise agree in writing, all
communications between Parent and the Shareholder Representative or any of
their respective representatives, on the one hand, and the Independent
Accountants, on the other hand, will be in writing, with copies
simultaneously delivered to the non-communicating party. The Independent
Accountants determination of the Unresolved Items will be final, binding and
conclusive on Parent, the Company Holders and the Shareholder Representative,
effective as of the date the Independent Accountants written determination
is received by Parent and the Shareholder Representative. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountants will be borne one-half by Parent and
one-half by the Shareholder Representative (for the account of the Company
Holders), and each of Parent and the Shareholder Representative (for the
account of the Company Holders) will bear its own legal, accounting and other
fees and expenses of participating in such dispute resolution procedure. 

   

 (e) Upon final determination of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ or  _(d)_ , as applicable, an adjustment will be determined and paid as follows: 

   

 (i) If the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Merger Consideration, the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall within five Business Days after such final determination issue joint written instructions directing the Escrow Agent to (x) pay to Parent the amount of such excess (or, if less, the entire amount of the Adjustment Escrow) out of the Adjustment Escrow, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by Parent, (y) pay to the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Holders) the remaining amount, if any, of the Adjustment Escrow ( _reduced_ by the amount provided for in _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ with respect to any Dissenting Shares, which amount shall instead be paid to Parent in the same method as specified in clause (x) above), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Shareholder Representative, and (z) if the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Merger Consideration by an amount that is greater than the amount of the Adjustment Escrow, pay the portion of such excess not paid from the Adjustment Escrow pursuant to clause (x) above to Parent from the Indemnity Escrow, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by Parent. 

   

 (ii) If the Merger Consideration exceeds the Estimated Merger Consideration, then within five Business Days after such final determination, Parent will pay to the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Holders) the amount of such excess ( _reduced_  by the amount provided for in _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ with respect to any Dissenting Shares) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Shareholder Representative, and the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay the amount of the Adjustment Escrow to the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Holders) ( _reduced_ by the amount provided for in _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ with respect to any Dissenting Shares, which amount shall instead be paid to Parent in the same method as specified in clause (i)(x) above).

 (f) Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, each accounting term used herein will have the meaning that is applied thereto in accordance with GAAP and, to the extent consistent with GAAP, the accounting principles, policies, procedures and methodologies consistently applied in preparing the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet Date and the accompanying statement of income (" _Company GAAP_ "). Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each amount included in the Estimate Statement, the Closing Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet will be (A) calculated in accordance with Company GAAP (without regard to materiality), including with respect to the nature or classification of accounts, and determining levels of reserves or levels of accruals, and the definitions for such amount (and the components of such amount) herein agreed; and (B) consistent with the books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; _provided_ that, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in determining current assets and liabilities hereunder, all accounting entries shall be taken into account regardless of their amount and all known errors and omissions shall be corrected. 

  

 (g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to the rights of the parties to seek specific performance of this _Section 2.3_ under _Section 8.9_ , this _Section 2.3_ sets forth the sole remedy of Parent and Merger Sub in respect of any Damages related to any asset or liability accounted for, or intended to be accounted for, in the calculation of Closing Working Capital, Net Closing Indebtedness or Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, and Parent and Merger Sub shall not be entitled to indemnification under _Article VII_ or any other recovery for any such Damages in respect thereof, whether or not the underlying facts constitute a breach of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this _Section 2.3(g)_ shall limit, restrict or negate Parents or Merger Subs right to indemnification for Damages arising out of or resulting from or in connection with a breach of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth herein or a breach of the Companys covenants set forth herein (including any such breach of representation or warranty or breach of covenant resulting from or relating to any such underlying facts) unless such Damages are included in the calculation of Merger Consideration as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ or _Section 2.3(d)_, as applicable. 

  

 SECTION 2.4. Exchange of Stock Certificates. 

  

 After the Effective Time, each Company Holder shall be entitled to receive, subject to the transfers and reductions provided for in _Section 2.5_, for each share of Common Stock or each Common Stock Equivalent (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) held by such Company Holder at the Effective Time: (i) the Closing Date Share Amount with respect to such share of Common Stock or such Common Stock Equivalent in cash, without interest, in exchange for the delivery of the corresponding Stock Certificate or Common Stock Equivalent Documents, duly endorsed for transfer or accompanied by appropriate transfer documents and accompanied by a duly executed Transmittal Letter, and (ii) the Post-Closing Share Amount with respect to such share of Common Stock or such Common Stock Equivalent in cash, without interest, payable in accordance with and subject to, and at the times provided for in this _Section 2.4_ and _Section 2.5_.

 SECTION 2.5. Payment; Escrow; Payment Procedures. 

  

 (a) _Initial Payment Fund_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent and/or Merger Sub shall pay to the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Holders) an amount in cash equal to the Estimated Merger Consideration _less_ the aggregate exercise price payable to the Company upon the exercise of all Common Stock Equivalents that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, _less_ the Adjustment Amount and the Indemnity Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Shareholder Representative. The amounts paid to the Shareholder Representative pursuant to this _Section 2.5(a)_ (the " _Initial Payment Fund_ "), and any and all amounts paid to the Shareholder Representative by Parent or the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.5(b)_ , and any and all amounts repaid by Parent to Shareholder Representative pursuant to  _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_ (collectively, the " _Additional Funds_ " and together with the Initial Payment Fund and all interest thereon, the " _Payment Fund_ "), shall be held and disbursed by the Shareholder Representative in accordance with this _Article II_.

Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent and/or Merger Sub shall deposit with the Escrow Agent (on behalf of the Company Holders) $3,000,000 (the " _Adjustment Amount_ " and, together with any interest or other earnings thereon, the " _Adjustment Escrow_ ") and $25 million (the " _Indemnity Amount_ " and, together with any interest or other earnings thereon, the " _Indemnity Escrow_ "; the Indemnity Escrow and the Adjustment Escrow are referred to as the " _Escrow Funds_ "), in each case, by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The Adjustment Escrow and the Indemnity Escrow shall be held by the Escrow Agent in segregated accounts to serve as the sole sources of payment of any adjustment to the Estimated Merger Consideration required by _Section 2.3(e)(i)_ or any indemnification obligation of the Company set forth in _Article VII_.

Parent). The date as of which all amounts in the Escrow Funds have been paid
out by the Escrow Agent is referred to as the " _Escrow Termination Date_ ".
Subject to _Section 2.5(c),_ any Escrow Funds paid to the
Shareholder Representative pursuant to this _Section 2.5(b)_ shall be
distributed by the Shareholder Representative to the Company Holders in
accordance with their respective shares of such amounts as determined in

The Shareholder Representative shall hold the Payment Fund on behalf of the Company Holders and use such funds for the sole purposes of (i) delivery of the Merger Consideration (less amounts withheld therefrom as the Sellers Expense Fund) to the Company Holders in accordance with the terms hereof, and (ii) establishing from the Closing Date Merger Consideration a reserve account (the " _Sellers  Expense Fund_"), in an amount determined by the Shareholder Representative prior to the Closing, which may be increased from time to time from the amount of any Escrow Funds received by it (the " _Sellers  Expense Amount_"), to pay actual or anticipated fees, expenses and other costs incurred by the Shareholder Representative for the benefit of the Company Holders on or after the Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including costs associated with the determination of the Merger Consideration and any investigation and resolution of indemnification claims and the fees and expenses of Kirkland and Ellis LLP payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). The Shareholder Representative shall have sole and exclusive authority to disburse and pay amounts placed into the Sellers Expense Fund consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. In no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives (including the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates and Representatives after the Closing) have any liability or obligation to any Company Holder with respect to the Payment Fund or any application thereof or disbursement therefrom, or otherwise for any amount paid or disbursed to the Shareholder Representative pursuant to this Agreement, other than, (x) with respect to the Surviving Corporation, as to (and only as to) any portion of the Payment Fund delivered to the Surviving Corporation for disbursements to Company Holders following the Turnover Date pursuant to  _Section 2.5(d)(iii)_ or (y) with respect to Parent, as to (and only as to) any portion of the Payment Fund to be delivered by Parent to the Shareholder Representative for disbursement to Formerly Dissenting Holders pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_.

Document(s), as applicable, to the Shareholder Representative (in its
capacity as paying agent for the Surviving Corporation) or, following the
Turnover Date, the Surviving Corporation, for payment pursuant to this
_Section 2.5_. The Transmittal Letter specifies that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the related Common Stock
and/or Common Stock Equivalent(s) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
such Stock Certificate(s) and/or Common Stock Equivalent Document(s) (or as
appropriate, in the reasonable judgment of the Shareholder Representative or,
following the Turnover Date, the Surviving Corporation, affidavit of loss in
respect thereof) to the Shareholder Representative or, following the Turnover
Date, the Surviving Corporation, in accordance with the terms of delivery
specified in the Transmittal Letter and the instructions for the use thereof
in surrendering such Stock Certificate(s) and/or Common Stock Document(s). 

   

 (ii) If a Company Holder delivered his, her or its Stock Certificate(s) and/or Common Stock Equivalent Document(s), as applicable, a properly completed Transmittal Letter and payment instructions (including wire transfer instructions if applicable) to the Shareholder Representative at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Closing Date Share Amount in respect of the Common Stock and/or Common Stock Equivalents represented by such Stock Certificate(s) and/or Common Stock Equivalent Document(s) so delivered will be paid to such Company Holder promptly but in no event later than five Business Days following the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time until surrendered in accordance with this _Section 2.5(d)_, each Stock Certificate and Common Stock Equivalent Document shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence only the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Applicable Share Amount into which such share of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalent previously represented thereby shall have been converted in the Merger in accordance with this _Article II_ (which Applicable Share Amount comprises the Closing Date Share Amount and any Post-Closing Share Amount, in each case, payable in accordance with and subject to, and at the times provided for in this _Article II_ ). No interest will accrue or be paid on any amount payable to the holder of any share of Common Stock and/or Common Stock Equivalent pursuant to this Agreement.

Post-Closing Merger Consideration was previously made to other Company
Holders) will be distributed to such Company Holder without interest, and
(ii) the later of the Escrow Termination Date and the first anniversary of
the Closing Date (such later date, the " _Turnover Date_ "). On or before the
fifth Business Day after the Turnover Date, the Shareholder Representative
shall pay all amounts then held by the Shareholder Representative on behalf
of all Company Holders, including any remaining portion of the Sellers
Expense Fund, to the Surviving Corporation. Thereafter the Surviving
Corporation will pay the Closing Date Share Amounts and any Post-Closing
Share Amounts attributable to such shares of Common Stock or Common Stock
Equivalents, without interest, as determined by the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with this Agreement, to each such Company Holder once such
Company Holder has delivered his, her or its Stock Certificate(s) and/or
Common Stock Equivalent Document(s), as applicable, a properly completed
Transmittal Letter and payment instructions (including wire transfer
instructions if applicable) to the Surviving Corporation. If a Company Holder
delivers his, her or its Stock Certificate(s) and/or Common Stock
Equivalent Document(s), as applicable, a properly completed Transmittal
Letter and payment instructions (including wire transfer instructions if
applicable) to the Shareholder Representative less than three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Closing Date Share Amounts attributable to
such Company Holders shares of Common Stock and/or Common Stock
Equivalents will be distributed to such Company Holder as soon as practicable
after the Closing Date, and any Post-Closing Share Amounts attributable to
such Company Holders shares of Common Stock and/or Common Stock Equivalents
will be paid thereafter to the extent, in the manner and at such times as
they are payable in accordance with this _Article II_. 

   

 (iv) If any Additional Funds are received by the Shareholder Representative from Parent pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_ or _Section 2.3(e)_ or from the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_, following the making of any payments to Company Holders who have delivered his, her or its Stock Certificate(s) and/or Common Stock Equivalent Document(s) as applicable, a properly completed Transmittal Letter and payment instructions (including wire transfer instructions if applicable) to the Shareholder Representative, pursuant to _Section 2.5(d)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ , after deducting any additions to the Seller Expense Fund, the Shareholder Representative shall pay to each such Company Holder, the additional portion of the Post-Closing Share Amount attributable to such Company Holders shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents as determined by the Shareholder Representative in accordance with this Agreement. 

   

 (v) To the extent the Shareholder Representative determines that amounts placed in the Sellers Expense Fund will not be used to pay fees, expenses and other costs incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such aggregate unused amount ( _reduced_ by the amount provided for in _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ with respect to any Dissenting Shares, which amount shall instead be paid to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by Parent) will be distributed by the Shareholder Representative to each Company Holder who has delivered his, her or its Stock Certificate(s) and/or Common Stock Equivalent(s), as applicable, a properly completed Transmittal Letter and payment instructions (including wire transfer instructions if applicable) to the Shareholder Representative, such Company

Holders allocable share of such amounts as determined by the Shareholder
Representative in accordance with this Agreement. 

  

 (e) _No Further Rights_.

 (b) For a period of two years following the Closing, the Shareholder Representative shall hold, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and advisors to hold, in confidence, all information received from, on behalf of or regarding the Company or any Company Subsidiaries as a result of or in connection with its majority equity interest in the Company or its role as Shareholder Representative; _provided_ , that the foregoing confidentiality obligation shall not apply to information (i) required or requested (under the terms of an Order or a subpoena, civil investigative demand, or other legal or investigative process) or otherwise required by applicable Law to be disclosed, (ii) already available to the public, or hereafter becoming available to the public, other than as a result of a breach of this _Section 6.2(b)_, or (iii) disclosed in connection with the exercise of any remedies provided in this Agreement or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights thereunder;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing confidentiality obligation shall not prevent the Shareholder Representative and its Affiliates and its and their respective direct and indirect equityholders, employees, officers, directors, representatives and advisors from disclosing such information to its Affiliates and its and their respective direct and indirect equityholders, employees, officers, directors, representatives and advisors (x) who have a need to know the information (i) to perform obligations under this Agreement and any other agreement or document delivered hereunder or (ii) to the extent necessary for the preparation of financial statements, regulatory filings or Tax returns in respect of periods ending on or prior to December 31, 2010 and (y) for reporting of financial results in the ordinary course of such Persons business in respect of periods ending on or prior to December 31, 2010. 

  

 SECTION 6.3. Further Assurances. 

  

 (a) In the event that after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desireable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers of each party to this Agreement, in their respective capacities as such, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all such action. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 6.4. Public Announcements. 

  

 Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the Merger and neither party shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the other partys written approval, except as may be required by Law, in which case the other party shall be advised and the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued to the extent practicable. 

  

 SECTION 6.5. Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees; Directors and Officers Insurance. 

  

 (a) Parent agrees that the certificate of formation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification of the former directors and officers of the Company and Company Subsidiaries on and prior to the Closing Date that are not less favorable to such persons than those set forth in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company on the date of this Agreement (the " _Current Charter_ "), and such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of Persons who at any time prior to the Effective Time were eligible to be indemnitees under the Current Charter in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless such modification is required by applicable Law. 

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the officers and directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on and prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, expenses (including reasonable costs, fees, expenses and disbursements of legal counsel), claims, damages, liabilities or amounts that are paid in settlement of, or otherwise in connection with, any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a " _Director/Officer Claim_ ") based in whole or in part on the fact that such Person is or was such a director or officer and arising out of actions or omissions or alleged actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), in each case to the fullest extent required by the Current Charter and permitted under the TBOC (and shall pay reasonable expenses (including all reasonable costs, fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel retained, in accordance with this  _Section 6.5(b)_, by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party) in advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the extent required by the Current Charter and permitted under the TBOC, upon receipt from the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced of the undertaking to repay such advances contemplated by Section 8.104 of the TBOC), _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement of any Director/Officer Claim effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section 6.5_, upon learning of any such Director/Officer Claim, shall notify the Surviving Corporation (although the failure to notify the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation from any 

   ##### 

  

 

liability which the Surviving Corporation may have under this _Section 6.5_
except to the extent such failure actually prejudices the Surviving
Corporation), and shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation the undertaking
contemplated by Section 8.104 of the TBOC. If there is one Indemnified Party
in connection with a Director/Officer Claim, such Indemnified Party may
retain one law firm (in addition to a single firm of local counsel, if
necessary) to represent it,  _provided_ that all counsel retained pursuant to
this sentence shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation. If there is more than one Indemnified Party in connection with a
Director/Officer Claim, such Indemnified Parties as a group shall retain one
law firm (in addition to a single firm of local counsel, if necessary) to
represent them with respect to each such matter unless there is, under
applicable standards of professional conduct (as determined by counsel to
such Indemnified Parties, in its reasonable judgment), a conflict on any
significant issue between the position of any two or more of such Indemnified
Parties, in which event, additional counsel may be retained by one or more of
such Indemnified Parties solely to the extent necessary to resolve such
conflict, _provided_ that all counsel retained pursuant to this
sentence shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation. 

   

 (d) The Company has obtained and fully paid the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance, and with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies. 

  

 (e) This _Section 6.5_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding _Section 6.5(a)_ through _(e)_ , the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to indemnify or advance expenses to or on behalf of any individual in respect of any matter that (disregarding dollar amounts and time limits set forth in _Article VII_) forms or would reasonably be expected to form the basis for a claim pursuant to _Section 7.1_. 

  

 SECTION 6.6. Employee Benefits Matters For a period of at least one year after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide compensation and employee benefits under plans, programs and arrangements, other than equity compensation plans, which, in the aggregate will provide compensation and employee benefits to the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries which, taken together, are no less favorable to the employees than those provided by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in effect on the date hereof. For purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate and level of benefits under the compensation and benefit plans covering any individual who is a current employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ ") after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company 

   ##### 

  

 

Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is comparable to a Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not
have been waived under the comparable Old Plans in which such employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be solely responsible for satisfying the requirements arising out of
Section 4980B of the Code with respect to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9. 

   

 SECTION 6.7. Labor Matters; WARN (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and all of the Company Subsidiaries not to, at any time prior to the 61st day following the Closing Date, without fully complying with the notice and other requirements of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 and any similar state or local Law (collectively, " _WARN Act_ "), effectuate (i) a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any site of employment of the Surviving Corporation or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or (ii) a "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment of the Surviving Corporation or any of the Company Subsidiaries. 

  

 (b) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary takes any action within 180 days after the Closing Date which independently, or in connection with any reduction in the size of the Surviving Corporations or any Company Subsidiarys work force occurring within the ninety day period prior to the Closing Date, could be construed as a "plant closing" or "mass layoff," as those terms are defined in the WARN Act, Parent shall be solely responsible for providing any notice required by the WARN Act and for making payments, if any, and paying all penalties and costs, if any, which may result from any failure to provide such notice. 

  

 (c) Except as contemplated by _Section 6.7(b)_, to the extent that any obligations, liability, expense or notice arises under the WARN Act (" _WARN Obligations_ ") on or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall be responsible for such WARN Obligations.

ARTICLE VII 

   

INDEMNIFICATION 

  

 SECTION 7.1. Indemnification of Parent. 

  

 (a) The Company agrees that, after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (each a " _Buyer Indemnified Person_ "), but only to the extent of funds on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow and the amounts available under the Indemnity Policy, shall, to the extent provided in this _Article VII_ be indemnified and held harmless from and against, any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of actions, losses, costs, damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses incurred or paid, including reasonable attorneys fees, costs of investigation or settlement, other professionals and experts fees, court or arbitration costs and Taxes of or with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or of or with respect to any other member of the same consolidated group, or any of their respective predecessors) paid or payable after the Effective Time but specifically excluding consequential damages, lost profits, indirect damages, punitive damages, exemplary damages and any Taxes incurred as a result of any recovery received under this _Article VII_ (any and all such amounts subject to indemnification hereunder, being hereinafter collectively referred to as " _Damages_ "), to the extent such Damages arise out of or result from, in connection with, or by virtue of (i) any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in any of the representations or warranties given or made by the Company in this Agreement (other than _Section 3.20_ and _Section 3.23_), as qualified by the Schedules hereto, or the facts or circumstances constituting any such inaccuracy or misrepresentation, or (ii) any breach by the Shareholder Representative of any covenant set forth in this Agreement, any Unpaid Company Transaction Expense to the extent it is not actually reflected in the Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses used to determine the Merger Consideration, or any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in the Companys representation and warranty in _Section 3.20_ or _Section 3.23_, as qualified by the Schedules hereto, or the facts or circumstances constituting any such inaccuracy or misrepresentation (collectively, " _Company Breaches_ "); _provided_ that Damages shall also include amounts awarded in a Third-Party Claim as consequential damages, lost profits, indirect damages, punitive damages or exemplary damages to any Person who is neither a Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person (as the case may be) nor an Affiliate thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, no Buyer Indemnified Person will be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ for any Damages to the extent such amount is actually reflected in the Net Closing Indebtedness, Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses or Closing Working Capital used to determine the Merger Consideration. The Company will not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Person for any Damages relating to any inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of which Parent had actual knowledge on the date hereof, as and only to the extent that such knowledge is supported by the exchange of information during Parents due diligence investigation of the Company. 

  

 (b) Any Claim for indemnification under this _Section 7.1_ must be raised in a Notice of Claim pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ prior to the Release Date and, if so raised prior to such date, such Claim shall survive the Release Date until final resolution thereof. Any Claim for indemnification by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this _Section 7.1_ for amounts contained in the Indemnity Escrow must be raised in a Notice of Claim pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ prior to 

   ##### 

  

 

the Escrow Release Date, and if not so raised, the amounts available under
the Indemnity Policy will be the sole source of recovery for the Buyer
Indemnified Parties for such Claim. 

   

 (c) The aggregate liability on account of Company Breaches pursuant to _Section 7.1_ or otherwise shall be limited to the Indemnity Escrow and the amounts available under the Indemnity Policy, and claims by the Buyer Indemnified Persons for Damages, whether under this _Article VII_ or otherwise, shall be satisfied solely from and to the extent of funds on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow and the amounts available under the Indemnity Policy. All Claims made on behalf of any Buyer Indemnified Person under this _Article VII_ shall first be applied against the Indemnity Escrow, and, following the first to occur of the depletion of the Indemnity Escrow and the Escrow Release Date, all such Claims remaining unresolved at that time or thereafter made under this _Article VII_ shall be applied against the Indemnity Policy, and recovery for any such Claims shall be limited to amounts available under the Indemnity Policy; _provided_ , that to the extent any Buyer Indemnified Person recovers the full amount of any Claim from the Indemnity Escrow (whether before or after the Escrow Release Date), no recovery for the same Claim may be obtained against the Indemnity Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 7.1_, the indemnification provided for in _Section 7.1(a)(i)_ shall not apply unless and until the aggregate Damages determined to be due for which the Buyer Indemnified Persons seek or have sought indemnification hereunder exceeds a cumulative aggregate amount equal to $10 million (the " _Basket_ "), in which event the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall, subject to the other limitations herein, be indemnified for all such Damages in excess of the Basket. 

  

 (d) The amount to which a Buyer Indemnified Person may become entitled under this _Article VII_ shall be (x) _less_ any actual recovery (whether by way of payment, discount, credit, off-set, counterclaim or otherwise, but excluding any tax benefit, credit or refund received or realized by any Buyer Indemnified Person, or to which any Buyer Indemnified Person may be entitled) received from a third party (including any insurer) and (y) _plus_ any out-of-pocket cost associated with receiving such recovery in respect of a claim. 

  

 (e) Each Buyer Indemnified Person shall be responsible for taking or causing to be taken all reasonable steps to mitigate its Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to Damages that may be indemnifiable under this _Section 7.1_ (it being agreed that the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of doing so shall themselves constitute Damages, to the extent the Damages mitigated would have been indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_, assuming timely notice pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ and compliance with the other applicable provisions of this _Article VII_, and disregarding, for this purpose only, the Basket and caps provided for in _Section 7.1(c))._ 

  

 (f) For purposes of this _Article VII_, including for purposes of calculating Damages, the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (other than the representations and warranties contained in the first sentence of _Section 3.7_ and clause (v) of _Section 3.12(a)_ ) shall be deemed to have been made without any qualifications as to materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications; _provided_ , _however_ , that exceptions citing specific dollar amounts will be given effect solely for purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred and not for purposes of calculating the amount of Damages resulting from or arising out of such breach. An Indemnitee shall have the right to seek indemnity under this _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ arising out of or relating to any breach of representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of 

   ##### 

  

 

the Indemnitor in respect of any fact or circumstance that reveals the
occurrence of such breach after the execution and delivery hereof. 

   

 SECTION 7.2. Indemnification of Company Holders. 

  

 (a) Parent agrees that, after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company Holders and the Shareholder Representative (each a " _Seller Indemnified Person_ ") from and against any and all Damages arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or (ii) any breach by Parent, Merger Sub or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, of any covenant set forth in this Agreement. Parent will not be obligated to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Person for any damages relating to any inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of which the Company or the Shareholder Representative had actual knowledge of the date hereof. 

  

 (b) The amount to which a Seller Indemnified Person may become entitled under this _Article VII_ shall be (x) _less_ any actual recovery (whether by way of payment, discount, credit, off-set, counterclaim or otherwise, but excluding any tax benefit, credit or refund received or realized by any Seller Indemnified Person, or to which any Seller Indemnified Person may be entitled) received from a third party (including any insurer) and (y) _plus_ any out-of-pocket cost associated with receiving such recovery in respect of a claim. 

  

 (c) Each Seller Indemnified Person shall be responsible for taking or causing to be taken all reasonable steps to mitigate its Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to Damages that may be indemnifiable under this _Section 7.2_ (it being agreed that the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of doing so shall themselves constitute Damages, to the extent the Damages mitigated would have been indemnifiable pursuant to  _Section 7.2(a)_, assuming timely notice pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_ and compliance with the other applicable provisions of this _Article VII_). 

  

 (d) Any Claim for indemnification under this _Section 7.2_ must be raised in a Notice of Claim pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ prior to the Release Date and, if so raised prior to such date, such Claim shall survive the Release Date until final resolution thereof. 

  

 SECTION 7.3. Notice of Claim. 

  

 (a) As used in this _Article VII_, the term " _Claim_ " means a claim for indemnification by any Buyer Indemnified Person or any Seller Indemnified Person, as the case may be, for Damages under this _Article VII_ (such Person making a Claim, an " _Indemnitee_ "). An Indemnitee may give notice of a Claim under this Agreement, whether for its own Damages or for Damages incurred by any other Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, pursuant to written notice of such Claim executed by Parent (in the case of a Claim by a Buyer Indemnified Person) or the Shareholder Representative (in the case of a Claim by a Seller Indemnified Person) (a " _Notice of Claim_ "), and delivered to the other of them (such receiving party, the " _Indemnitor_ "), promptly after such Indemnitee becomes aware of the existence of any potential claim by such Indemnitee for indemnification under this _Article VII_ , but in any event before the Release Date, arising out of or resulting from: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of _Section 7.1_ or _7.2_ ; or 

   

 (ii) the assertion, whether orally or in writing, against any Indemnitee of a claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or proceeding brought by a third party against any Indemnitee (in each such case, a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that arises out of or results from any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of _Section 7.1_ or  _7.2_ ; 

 

 _provided_ that, so long as such notice is given prior to the Release Date,
the failure to timely give such notice shall not limit or reduce the
Indemnitees right to indemnification hereunder unless (and then only to the
extent that) the Indemnitor is (or the Company Holders are, in the case of a
Notice of Claim on behalf of a Buyer Indemnified Person) prejudiced thereby.
Each Notice of Claim with respect to a Claim made by or on behalf of a Buyer
Indemnified Person that is delivered to the applicable Indemnitor shall be
concurrently delivered to the Insurance Carrier. 

   

 (b) Each Notice of Claim shall: 

   

 (i) state that the Indemnitee has incurred or paid or, in good faith, believes that it is reasonably likely that it will have to incur or pay, Damages in an aggregate stated amount (where practicable) arising from such Claim (which amount may be the amount of damages claimed by a third party in an action brought against any Indemnitee based on alleged facts, which if true, would give rise to liability for Damages to such Indemnitee under this _Article VII_, or a good faith estimate, based on the information available to the Indemnitee at such time, of Damages that the Indemnitee believes that it is reasonably likely that it will have to incur or pay); and 

   

 (ii) contain a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably available to the Indemnitee), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the alleged Damages based on the Indemnitees good faith belief and knowledge thereof, including the identity and address of any third-party claimant (to the extent reasonably available to the Indemnitee). 

 

Following delivery of the Notice of Claim (or at the same time if the
Indemnitee so elects) the Indemnitee shall deliver copies of any demand or
complaint, the amount of Damages, the date each such item was incurred or
paid, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the specific nature of
the breach to which such item is related. 

   

 SECTION 7.4. Defense of Third-Party Claims. 

  

 (a) Subject to the provisions hereof, the Indemnitor on behalf of the Indemnitee shall have the right to elect to defend and control the defense of any Third-Party Claim, and, as provided by  _Section 7.5_, the costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnitor in connection with such defense (including attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be paid by the Indemnitor (it being understood that if the Indemnitee is a Buyer Indemnified Person, the Shareholder Representative shall use the Sellers Expense Fund (and not any portion of the Indemnity Escrow, except to the extent the Seller Expense Fund is increased from any portion of the Indemnity Escrow received by the Shareholder Representative) to fund the expenses it incurs in connection with the defense of any such Third-Party Claim). If the Sellers Expense Fund is depleted prior to the date on which no unresolved Claims against 

   ##### 

  

 

the Indemnity Escrow by any Buyer Indemnified Person remain, Shareholder
Representative may elect to have Parent (on behalf the Buyer Indemnified
Persons) defend, or assume control of the defense of, any Third-Party
Claim against a Buyer Indemnified Person, in which case Parent shall have
available to it the Indemnity Escrow to fund its reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the defense of such Third-
Party Claim, and Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall from time
to time execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
directing disbursements from the Indemnity Escrow for such purpose. The
Indemnitee (unless itself controlling the Third-Party Claim in accordance
with this _Section 7.4(a)_) may participate, through counsel of its own
choice and, except as provided herein, at its own expense, in the defense of
any Third-Party Claim. 

   

 (b) The Indemnitee shall give prompt written notice of any Third-Party Claim to the Indemnitor; _provided_ that, so long as such notice is given prior to the Release Date, the failure to timely give such notice shall not limit or reduce the Indemnitees right to indemnity hereunder unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnitor is (or the Company Holders are, in the case of a Notice of Claim on behalf of a Buyer Indemnified Person) prejudiced thereby. The Indemnitor shall be entitled to assume the control and defense thereof utilizing legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee; _provided_ that the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense if (A) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (B) the claim seeks an injunction against the Indemnitee (or against any Company Subsidiary, if the Indemnitee is a Buyer Indemnified Person), to the extent that such defense relates to the claim for such injunction, or (C) the Shareholder Representative has elected to have Parent defend, or assume the control and defense of, a Third-Party Claim in accordance with _Section 7.4(a)_. 

  

 (c) If the Indemnitor has the right to and does elect to control the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall: (i) conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim with reasonable diligence and keep the Indemnitee reasonably informed of material developments in the Third-Party Claim at all stages thereof; (ii) promptly submit to the Indemnitee copies of all pleadings, responsive pleadings, motions and other similar legal documents and papers received or filed in connection therewith; (iii) permit the Indemnitee and its counsel to confer on the conduct of the defense thereof; and (iv) permit the Indemnitee and its counsel an opportunity to review all legal papers to be submitted prior to their submission. If the Parent controls the defense of any Third-Party Claim against a Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_, Parent shall: (i) conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim with reasonable diligence and keep the Indemnitor reasonably informed of material developments in the Third-Party Claim at all stages thereof; (ii) promptly submit to the Indemnitor copies of all pleadings, responsive pleadings, motions and other similar legal documents and papers received or filed in connection therewith; (iii) permit the Indemnitor and its counsel to confer on the conduct of the defense thereof; and (iv) permit the Indemnitor and its counsel an opportunity to review all legal papers to be submitted prior to their submission. Parent and the Shareholder Representative will make available to each other and each others counsel and accountants, without charge, all of its or their books and records relating to the Third-Party Claim, and each party will render to the other party such assistance as may be reasonably required in order to insure the proper and adequate defense thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the other party in connection therewith. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) If the Indemnitor controls the defense of and defends any Third-Party Claim under this  _Section 7.4_, the Indemnitor shall have the right to effect a settlement of such Third-Party Claim on the Indemnitees behalf without the consent of the Indemnitee; _provided_ that (A) in the case of a Third-Party Claim against a Buyer Indemnified Person, the amount to be paid as a result of such settlement does not exceed the balance of the Indemnity Escrow (after taking into account all Claims then pending against the Indemnity Escrow and assuming for purposes of this  _Section 7.4(d)_ that the full amount of each such Claim is payable from the Indemnity Escrow), (B) such settlement does not involve any injunctive relief binding upon the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, and (C) such settlement expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnitee and the other applicable Indemnified Persons (that is, each of the Buyer Indemnified Persons, if the Indemnitee is a Buyer Indemnified Person, and each of the Seller Indemnified Persons, if the Indemnitee is a Seller Indemnified Person) from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third-Party Claim, without prejudice. If the Indemnitee controls the defense of and defends any Third-Party Claim under this _Section 7.4_, the Indemnitee shall have the right to effect a settlement of such Third-Party Claim with the consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). No settlement by the Indemnitee of such Third-Party Claim shall limit or reduce the right of any Indemnified Person to indemnity hereunder for all Damages they may incur arising out of or resulting from the Third-Party Claim to the extent indemnified in this _Article VII_ (provided that no such settlement that occurs without the Indemnitors consent (provided that such consent was not unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be binding upon the Indemnitor (or any Company Holder, in the case of a Claim on behalf of a Buyer Indemnified Person) or constitute evidence that any Indemnitee has suffered Damages that are indemnifiable pursuant to _Sections 7.1(a)_ or _7.2_ , or of the amount of such Damages). As used in this _Article VII_, the term "settlement" refers to any consensual resolution of the claim in question, including by consent, decree or by permitting any judgment or other resolution of a claim to occur without disputing the same, and the term "settle" has a corresponding meaning. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Indemnitor under this Agreement shall not have any rights under this _Section 7.4_ to the extent any Claims for indemnification under _Section 7.1_ are made by or on behalf of a Buyer Indemnified Person against the Indemnity Policy in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, including the right to defend or control the defense of any such Claim, effect a settlement of any such Claim or consent to a settlement of any such Claim. 

  

 SECTION 7.5. Resolution of Notice of Claim. 

  

 Each Notice of Claim given by an Indemnitee shall be resolved as follows: 

  

 (a) _Admitted Claims_. If, within 20 Business Days after a Notice of Claim is delivered to the Indemnitor, the Indemnitor agrees in writing that liability for such Claim is indemnified under _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, as applicable, the full amount of the Damages specified in the Notice of Claim is agreed to, and that such Notice of Claim is timely, the Indemnitor (on behalf of the Company Holders if the Indemnitee is a Buyer Indemnified Person) shall be conclusively deemed to have consented to the recovery by the Indemnitee of the full amount of Damages specified in the Notice of Claim in accordance with this _Article VII_, including, if the Indemnitee is a Buyer Indemnified Person, the forfeiture of a portion of the Indemnity Escrow equal to such 

   ##### 

  

 

Damages, and Parent shall be authorized to deliver such agreement to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to make a wire transfer to Parent
in the amount of such Damages;  _provided_ _,_ that to the extent the full
amount of Damages is not known at the time such Notice of Claim is delivered
(such as in the case of a Third-Party Claim which is subject to an unresolved
dispute between the claimant and the Indemnitee, with respect to amounts
claimed by the claimant), payment by the Indemnitor under this _Section
7.5(a)_ with respect to any speculative Damages shall not be due until the
actual amount of such Damages is known. 

   

 (b) _Contested Claims_. If the Indemnitor does not so agree in writing to such Notice of Claim or gives the Indemnitee written notice contesting all or any portion of a Notice of Claim (a " _Contested Claim_ ") within the 20 Business Day period specified in _Section 7.5(a)_ , then such Contested Claim shall be resolved by either (i) a written settlement agreement executed by Parent and the Shareholder Representative or (ii) in the absence of such a written settlement agreement within 60 days after Indemnitors receipt of the Notice of Claim related to such Contested Claim or such longer period as is mutually agreed upon by the parties, by binding arbitration between Parent and the Shareholder Representative in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 7.5_. 

  

 (c) _Arbitration of Contested Claims_. Any Contested Claim against the Indemnity Escrow that is not settled by the Parent and the Shareholder Representative as set forth in _Section 7.5(b)_ shall be submitted to mandatory, final and binding arbitration before J.A.M.S./ENDISPUTE or its successor (" _J.A.M.S._ ") pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (" _FAA_ "), 9 U.S.C., _Section 1_ et seq., and any such arbitration shall be conducted in New York, New York. If J.A.M.S. ceases to provide arbitration service, then the term "J.A.M.S." shall thereafter mean and refer to the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ "). Either Parent or the Shareholder Representative may commence the arbitration process called for by _Section 7.5_ by filing a written demand for arbitration with J.A.M.S. and giving a copy of such demand to the other. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of J.A.M.S.s Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration (or, if J.A.M.S. then means the AAA, the applicable commercial arbitration rules of the AAA then in effect), subject to the provisions of this _Section 7.5(c)_. The parties shall cooperate with J.A.M.S. and with each other in promptly selecting a single arbitrator from J.A.M.S.s panel of neutrals and in scheduling the arbitration proceedings in order to fulfill the provisions, purposes and intent of this Agreement. If the parties do not agree upon the selection of an arbitrator within at least 21 calendar days before the commencement of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall be selected by J.A.M.S. The Parent and the Shareholder Representative covenant that they shall participate in the arbitration in good faith and that Parent, on the one hand, and the Company Holders (through the Sellers Expense Fund or, if such fund is depleted, through the Shareholder Representative), on the other hand, shall pay half of the arbitration costs in accordance with this Agreement. The provisions of this _Section 7.5(c)_ may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude the parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court having competent jurisdiction. 

  

 (d) _Payment of Costs_. Parent, on the one hand, and the Company Holders (through the Sellers Expense Fund or, if such fund is depleted, through the Shareholder Representative), on the other hand, shall each bear one-half of the burden of deposits and advances required by the arbitrator, but either of them may advance such amounts, subject to recovery as an addition or 

   ##### 

  

 

offset to any award. For the avoidance of doubt, the monetary recovery owed to
the prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding shall include
reimbursement of such advances. 

   

 (e) _Burden of Proof_. Except as may be otherwise expressly provided herein, for any Contested Claim submitted to arbitration, the burden of proof shall be as it would be if the claim were litigated in a judicial proceeding governed exclusively by the internal Laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts executed and entered into within the State of New York, without regard to the principles of choice of law or conflicts of law that could cause the laws of any other jurisdiction to be applied. 

  

 (f) _Award_. Upon the conclusion of any arbitration proceedings hereunder, the arbitrator shall render findings of fact and conclusions of law and a final written arbitration award setting forth the basis and reasons for any decision reached (the " _Final Award_ ") and shall deliver such documents to the Shareholder Representative and Parent, together with a signed copy of the Final Award. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and the FAA, the Final Award shall constitute a conclusive determination of all issues in question, binding upon the Company Holders, the Shareholder Representative and Parent. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. 

  

 (g) _Timing_. The Shareholder Representative, Parent and the arbitrator shall conclude each arbitration pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ as promptly as possible for the Contested Claim being arbitrated, but in no event later than six months after the arbitration is first initiated, unless the arbitrator determines that good cause exists for an extended time period. 

  

 (h) _Terms of Arbitration_. The arbitrator chosen in accordance with _Section 7.5_ shall not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of _Section 7.5_ or any other provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 (i) _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Effective Time, except as specifically otherwise provided in this Agreement, arbitration conducted in accordance with this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties (other than the parties rights to specific performance of the provisions of this Agreement under _Section 8.9_) for any disputes between or among the parties hereto relating to any Claim made pursuant to this _Article VII._ 

  

 (j) _Payment to Parent_. If any Buyer Indemnified Person is entitled to the recovery of Damages pursuant to any Claim that is agreed to pursuant to _Section 7.5(a)_, or a Contested Claim that is resolved pursuant to _Section 7.5(c)_, Parent, on its own behalf or on behalf of a Buyer Indemnified Person, shall be entitled under the terms of the Escrow Agreement to receive from the Indemnity Escrow the amount of Damages arising out of or resulting from such Claim as so determined pursuant to this _Article VII_ (or, if less, the entire Indemnity Escrow) in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and _Section 2.5(b)_ of this Agreement, and Parent, on its own behalf or on behalf of a Buyer Indemnified Person, shall be entitled to seek recovery against the Indemnity Policy for any portion of such Claim not covered by the Indemnity Escrow. 

  

 (k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Indemnitor under this Agreement shall not have any right under this _Section 7.5_ to contest any Claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.1_ to the extent such Claim is made by or on behalf of a 

   ##### 

  

 

Buyer Indemnified Person against the Indemnity Policy in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, and the provisions of this _Section 7.5_
(other than _Section 7.5(a)_) shall not apply to any such Claim. 

   

 SECTION 7.6. Survival of Covenants, Representations and Warranties. 

  

 (a) All representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement, as qualified by the Schedules hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect until August 31, 2012 (the " _Release Date_ ") (or, if any unresolved Claims under _Article VII_ exist with respect to any such representations and warranties as of the Release Date, such specific representations and warranties underlying such Claims shall survive until the day on which such Claims are resolved); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer Indemnified Persons may only seek indemnification for any Damages with respect to any Claims of which they or any one of them becomes aware from and following December 31, 2011 (the " _Escrow Release Date_ "), or with respect to which they provide a Notice of Claim pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ on or after the Escrow Release Date, solely as against the Indemnity Policy. All representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, until the Release Date (or, if any unresolved Claims under _Article VII_ exist with respect to any such representations and warranties or certificate as of the Release Date, such specific representations, warranties or certifications underlying such Claims shall survive until the day on which such Claims are resolved). All covenants of the parties shall survive according to their respective terms. 

  

 (b) Except as expressly set forth in _Article III_ hereto, neither the Company nor any other Person makes any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, at law or in equity in respect of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective assets, liabilities, businesses or operations, including with respect to merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose, and any such other representations or warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed. The disclosure of any matter or item in any schedule to _Article III_ hereto shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement that any such matter is required to be disclosed. 

  

 (c) Except as expressly set forth in _Article IV_ and _V_ hereto, neither Merger Sub nor Parent makes any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, at law or in equity in respect of Merger Sub or Parent, or any of their respective assets, liabilities or operations, including with respect to merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose, and any such other representations or warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed. The disclosure of any matter or item in any schedule to _Article IV_ and _V_ hereto shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement that any such matter is required to be disclosed. 

  

 SECTION 7.7. Exclusive Remedy; Non-Recourse. 

  

 (a) After the Effective Time the indemnification rights in this _Article VII_ are and shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Buyer Indemnified Persons and the Seller Indemnified Persons with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or any certification delivered hereunder; _provided_ that this sentence shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of its rights with respect to claims against any Person to the extent they arise out of actual fraud by such Person or of its right to seek specific performance or injunctive relief in the 

   ##### 

  

 

case of another partys failure to comply with the post-Closing covenants made
by such other party (including its obligations under this _Article VII_). 

   

 (b) Subject to _Section 7.7(a)_, Parent, for itself, its successors and assigns including the Surviving Corporation, acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are non-recourse as to the Shareholder Representative and the Company Holders and that they shall have no recourse for or on account of any matter, cause, claim or thing of or relating to this Agreement or the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby, excepting only against and to the extent of the Indemnity Escrow or the Adjustment Escrow and then only in accordance with _Section 2.3_ and this _Article VII_. 

  

 (c) Other than as contemplated by this _Article VII_ or _Section 8.9_, in furtherance of the foregoing, Parent, for itself, its successors and assigns (including the Surviving Corporation) covenants and agrees that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall sue or initiate or maintain any action, suit or cause of action against the Shareholder Representative or the Company Holders (in their capacity as such) or any of them as a result of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (d) For the avoidance of doubt, the sole recourse of the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Claims for which a Notice of Claim is provided on or after the Escrow Release Date shall be from amounts available under the Indemnity Policy. 

  

 (e) The provisions of _Article VII_ were specifically bargained for and reflected in the amounts payable to the Company Holders in connection with the Merger pursuant to _Article II_. 

  

 SECTION 7.8. Appointment of Shareholder Representative. By voting in favor of or consenting to the Merger and/or by virtue of the approval of the Merger, or accepting any portion of the Merger Consideration, each Company Holder agrees as follows: 

  

 (a) ABRY Partners, LLC (in such capacity, the " _Shareholder Representative_ ") is designated as the attorney-in-fact and agent for and on behalf of each Company Holder and their respective heirs, successors and assigns with respect to the post-Closing adjustments contemplated by _Section 2.3_, claims for indemnification under this _Article VII_ and the taking by the Shareholder Representative of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Shareholder Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including the exercise of the power to: (i) authorize the release or delivery to Parent of all or any portion of the Escrow Funds or the Sellers Expense Fund in satisfaction of the obligations (if any) with respect to the post-Closing adjustments contemplated by _Section 2.3_ and indemnification claims by any Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Article VII_ and any amounts described in _Section 2.5_; (ii) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to, such indemnification claims; (iii) litigate, arbitrate, resolve, settle or compromise any claim for indemnification made pursuant to this _Article VII_; (iv) establish the Sellers Expense Fund and pay such amounts therefrom as the Shareholder Representative deems necessary or appropriate in its good faith judgment; and (v) take all actions necessary in the judgment of the Shareholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Shareholder Representative shall not take any action where (x) any Company Holder would be held liable for Damages (including, 

   ##### 

  

 

for the avoidance of doubt, obligations to indemnify and reimburse the
Shareholder Representative pursuant to this _Section 7.8_) in excess of such
Company Holders share of the Escrow Funds and of the Sellers Expense Fund
without such Company Holders consent or (y) such action materially and
adversely affects the substantive rights or obligations of one Company
Holder, or group of Company Holders, without a similar proportionate effect
upon the substantive rights or obligations of all Company Holders, unless
each such disproportionately affected Company Holder consents in writing
thereto. The Shareholder Representative shall have no authority or power to
act on behalf of the Company except as expressly provided in this
Agreement. The Shareholder Representative shall have authority and power to
act on behalf of the Company Holders with respect to the disposition,
settlement or other handling of the adjustments contemplated by _Section
2.3_ and all claims under this _Article VII_ and all rights or obligations
arising under _Section 2.3_ and this _Article VII_ or otherwise
as contemplated by this Agreement. The Company Holders shall be bound by all
actions taken and documents executed by the Shareholder Representative in
connection with _Section 2.3_ and this _Article VII_, and Parent shall be
entitled to rely on any action or decision of the Shareholder Representative.
In performing the functions specified in this Agreement, the Shareholder
Representative may act upon any instrument or other writing believed by the
Shareholder Representative in good faith to be genuine and to be signed or
presented by the proper Person and shall not be liable in connection with the
performance by it of its duties pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement except that, solely as among the
Shareholder Representative and the Company Holders, the Shareholder
Representative shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by Law for its
own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Shareholder Representative
shall be indemnified and held harmless (out of funds that otherwise are to be
distributed from the Escrow Funds or the Sellers Expense Fund to the Company
Holders, if any, or other amounts paid to the Shareholder Representative on
the Company Holders behalf as described in _Section 2.3(e)_, as described
in this _Section 7.8_) from and against any loss, liability or expense
incurred on the part of the Shareholder Representative and arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder;
_provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, each Company Holders
responsibility to indemnify the Shareholder Representative shall be limited
to the aggregate amount to be received by such Company Holder in respect of
its Common Stock and/or Common Stock Equivalents. Any out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the Shareholder Representative in connection with
actions taken by the Shareholder Representative pursuant to the terms of
_Section 2.3_ or this _Article VII_ or otherwise in connection with this
Agreement for the benefit of all Company Holders including the hiring of legal
counsel and the incurring of legal fees and costs (" _Representative
Expenses_ ") shall be the responsibility of the Company Holders and may be
paid or reimbursed from the Sellers Expense Fund, amounts paid to the
Shareholder Representative from the Escrow Funds or other amounts paid to
the Shareholder Representative pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_; _provided_ ,
that for the avoidance of doubt, each Company Holders responsibility to
reimburse the Shareholder Representative for such expenses shall be limited
to the aggregate amount to be received by such Company Holder in respect of
its Common Stock and/or Common Stock Equivalents; _provided_ , further, that
the Shareholder Representative shall not receive any compensation in excess of
such reimbursement for performing its duties as Shareholder Representative
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Shareholder Representative shall have full power and
authority to interpret all the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, and to consent to any amendment hereof or thereof, on behalf
of all 

    ##### 

  

    

the Company Holders and their respective heirs, successors and assigns. Upon
the request of each Company Holder, the Shareholder Representative shall keep
such Company Holder reasonably informed as to the status of any actions being
taken by the Shareholder Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement. 

   

 (b) The Company Holders hereby appoint and constitute the Shareholder Representative the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the Company Holders, with full power in their name and on their behalf to act according to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and in general to do all things and to perform all acts including executing and delivering the Escrow Agreement any other agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions, notices or instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable in connection with the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not entitle the Shareholder Representative to execute any non-solicitation, non-competition or similar restrictive covenant on behalf of any Company Holder without the consent of such Company Holder. This power of attorney and all authority hereby conferred is granted and shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any Company Holder, by operation of law, whether by such persons death, disability, protective supervision or any other event. Without limiting the foregoing, this power of attorney is to ensure the performance of a special obligation and, accordingly, each Company Holder shall be deemed to have waived and renounced its, his or her right to renounce this power of attorney unilaterally any time before the day following the Escrow Termination Date. Each Company Holder shall be deemed to have waived any and all defenses that may be available to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Shareholder Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the power of attorney granted in this _Section 7.8_, no agreement, instrument, acknowledgement or other act or document shall be ineffective as to any Company Holder solely by reason of such Company Holder (instead of the Shareholder Representative) having signed or given the same directly.

 SECTION 8.3. Headings; Interpretation. 

  

 The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. As all parties to this Agreement have participated in the drafting of this Agreement, no ambiguity shall be construed against any party as the drafter. The use of the word " _including_ " herein shall mean " _including without limitation._ " The use of the terms " _Company_ " and " _Company Subsidiary_ " herein shall also refer to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, respectively, following the Effective Time. Any matter disclosed pursuant to any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule whose relevance or applicability to any representation or warranty made elsewhere in this Agreement or to the information called for by any other section of the Company Disclosure Schedule is readily apparent on the face of such disclosure shall be deemed to be an exception to such representations and warranties and to be disclosed with respect to all such sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule, notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross-reference thereto; _provided_  that the foregoing will not be applicable to sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule that set forth an affirmative list of items required to be set forth in response to such item rather than as a modification or exception to the applicable section of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 8.4. Severability. 

  

 If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  

 SECTION 8.5. Entire Agreement. 

  

 This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, the Schedules and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

  

 SECTION 8.6. Assignment. 

  

 Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that Parent or Merger Sub may, without the consent of any Person, assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder for collateral purposes ( _provided_ that, in either case, no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder).

 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all expenses incurred by the parties hereto shall be borne solely by the party that has incurred such expenses.

 Each party agrees that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that each of the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any Federal court or state court located in Manhattan, New York, New York, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Each party hereto, for itself and its successors and assigns, irrevocably agrees that any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be instituted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, United States of America or in the absence of jurisdiction, the state courts located in New York, New York, and generally and unconditionally accepts and irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any final judgment rendered thereby from which no appeal has been taken or is available in connection with this Agreement. Each party, for itself and its successors and assigns, irrevocably waives any objection it may have now or hereafter to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding, including any objection based on the grounds of forum non conveniens, in the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties, for itself and its successors and assigns, irrevocably agrees that all process in any such proceedings in any 

   ##### 

  

    

such court may be effected by notice given in accordance with the provisions

EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INFORMED BY THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO THAT THIS _SECTION 8.11(b)_ CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH THEY ARE RELYING AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS _SECTION 8.11(b)_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. 

  

 SECTION 8.12. No Recourse. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub agree and acknowledge that, except (i) as provided in _Section 2.3(e)_ and _Article VII_ with respect to the Adjustment Escrow and the Indemnity Escrow, respectively, (ii) for the right of the Buyer Indemnified Persons and the Seller Indemnified Persons to bring suit for claims arising out of actual fraud as described in _Section 7.7(a)_ and (iii) for the right of the parties to seek specific performance under _Section 8.9_, no recourse under this Agreement or any document or instrument delivered in connection with this Agreement shall be had against any Company Holder or the Shareholder Representative, any Affiliate of any of them, or any current or future director, officer, employee, general or limited partner or member of any Company Holder, the Shareholder Representative or of any Affiliate thereof, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Company Holder or the Shareholder Representative, any Affiliate of any of them, or any current or future director, officer, employee, general or limited partner or member of any Company Holder, the Shareholder Representative or of any Affiliate thereof for any obligation under this Agreement or any document or instrument delivered in connection with this Agreement for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. 

  

 SECTION 8.13. Attorneys. 

  

 Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Shareholder Representative and its Affiliates and the Company have been represented by the law firm of Kirkland and Ellis LLP (the 

   ##### 

  

    

" _Firm_ ") in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the
Merger and in other matters. The parties agree that, while the representation
by the Firm in the negotiation of this Agreement and the Merger and in such
other matters has nominally been of the Company, the Firms true clients
have been the Shareholder Representative and its Affiliates. As a
consequence, the parties agree: (i) that the holder of the privilege with
respect to any discussions with any client of the Firm relative to this
Agreement and the Merger or such other matters prior to the date of the
Closing shall be the Shareholder Representative and its Affiliates (other
than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), and the Company shall have no
rights with respect thereto, including the right to waive the same; and (ii)
that none of the parties hereto shall take any action to attempt
to disqualify the Firm from representing the Shareholder Representative and
its Affiliates or any other Company Holder in connection with any dispute
relating to this Agreement or the Merger based on the representation by the
Firm of the Company in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and
the Merger or otherwise prior to the Closing. 

  

 SECTION 8.14. Counterparts. 

  

 This Agreement may be executed and delivered in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
