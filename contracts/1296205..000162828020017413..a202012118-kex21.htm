Exhibit A - Form of PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights Agreement AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 10, 2020 (this
"Agreement"), by and among Zephyr Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Zephyr Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and ZAGG Inc, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors (or similar governing bodies) of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved and declared advisable the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger") upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL");

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors (or similar governing bodies) of
Parent and the Company have determined that the Merger is in furtherance of
and consistent with their respective business strategies and is in the best
interest of their respective stockholders, and the Company, on the one hand,
and Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, on the other hand, have
approved the execution of this Agreement, including the Merger, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board")
recommends that the Company's stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement
and authorize the transactions contemplated hereby;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to the Company's willingness to enter into this Agreement,
Evercel, Inc. (the "Guarantor") has duly executed and delivered to the Company
a guaranty, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in favor of the Company
(the "Sponsor Guaranty"); and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain
stockholders of the Company have duly executed and delivered to Parent support
agreements, dated as of the date hereof, pursuant to which such stockholders
have agreed to vote the shares of Company Common Stock owned by them in favor
of the Merger, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein (the
"Support Agreements").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

Article 1.

The Merger



Section 1.1 The Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Closing") shall take place by the electronic exchange of documents as soon as practicable on the
date which is two (2) Business Days after the date on which all conditions set
forth in Article 6 shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or such other manner and
date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree. The date on which the
Closing actually occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing
Date".

Section 1.2 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the
DGCL, at the Effective Time Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of
the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

Section 1.3 Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the Closing, the
parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL (the date and time of
such filing, or if another date and time is specified in such filing, such
specified date and time, being the "Effective Time").

Section 1.4 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, except as
otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.



Section 1.5 Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended in their entirety to contain the provisions set forth in the
Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of Merger Sub, each as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as the same may be amended subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 5.9(c).



Section 1.6 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office until their successors have been duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation. The Company shall cause each member of the Company
Board to tender his or her resignation in his or her capacity as such prior to
the Effective Time, with each such resignation to be effective as of the
Effective Time. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation. Article 2.

Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares



Section 2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any of the following securities:

a.Conversion Generally. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Excluded
Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and any
Dissenting Shares), shall be converted, subject to Section 2.3(d), into the
right to receive from the Surviving Corporation (i) the Closing Date Per Share
Merger Consideration in cash, payable to the holder thereof in accordance with
Section 2.3, and (ii) one PPP Loan Forgiveness Right, representing the right
to receive any Per Share Additional Merger Consideration that may become
payable to the holder thereof as provided in the PPP Loan Rights Agreement
(collectively, the "Merger Consideration"). All such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") or any non-certificated shares of
Company Common Stock represented in book-entry form (the "Book-Entry Shares")
shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor. Certificates or Book-Entry Shares previously representing shares of
Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration upon the
surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.3, without interest and subject to any deduction for
withholding Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with Section
2.3(g).



b.Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common
Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub, any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or
Merger Sub, in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the
"Excluded Company Common Stock") shall be canceled and extinguished without
any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.



c.Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.



d.Change in Company Common Stock. If between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason
of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration and RSU Consideration shall be
correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.



Section 2.2 Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Units. At the Effective
Time, each Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior thereto,
shall by virtue of the Merger automatically and without any action on the part
of the Company, Parent or the holder thereof, be cancelled and terminated and
converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation as provided
below: (i) the Closing Date Per Share Merger Consideration in cash, payable to
the holder thereof in accordance with Section 2.3 multiplied by the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Closing Date RSU
Consideration"); and (ii) an aggregate number of PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights
equal to the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying
such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively,
the "RSU Consideration"). Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Surviving Corporation, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay to each holder of Company RSU Awards the Closing
Date RSU Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes) on the
Surviving Corporation's first regularly scheduled payroll date occurring at
least five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time. Any payment with
respect to PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights issued with respect to any Company RSU
Award will be made as provided in the PPP Loan Rights Agreement.



Section 2.3 Exchange of Certificates.



a.Exchange Agent.

i.On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate Empire Stock
Transfer or another bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the
"Exchange Agent"). On the Closing Date, (A) Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this
Article 2, through the Exchange Agent, cash in U.S. dollars in an amount
sufficient to pay the Closing Date Per Share Merger Consideration with respect
to all of the shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Excluded Company
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting
Shares) as provided in Section 2.1(a) (which, for the avoidance of doubt shall
not include the Closing Date RSU Consideration to be paid as provided in
Section 2.2) and (B) Parent will, or will cause to be deposited with the
Surviving Corporation, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
Closing Date RSU Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.2 (such
cash, and any interest and earnings thereon in clauses (A) and (B), in the
aggregate, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") payable
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) or Section 2.2, as applicable. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose other than to fund payments due
pursuant to this Article 2.



ii.The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash remaining in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent, provided, that (A) no such investment or losses thereon
shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common
Stock, (B) following any such losses or events that result in the Exchange
Fund becoming not immediately available or that result in the amount of funds
in the Exchange Fund being insufficient to promptly pay the portion of the
aggregate Merger Consideration that remains unpaid, Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders
of Company Common Stock to the extent of such insufficiency and (C) such
investments shall be in the following (or a combination thereof): (I) short-
term direct obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no
more than thirty days, (II) short term obligations for which the full faith
and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for payment
of all principal and interest, (III) commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or
A-1 or better by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's
Corporation, respectively, (IV) money market funds of the highest rating
issued by either Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's
Corporation, or (V) certificates of deposit or similar instruments issued by
commercial banks with not less than $1 billion of capital. Any interest or
other income resulting from the investment of such funds shall be added to the
Exchange Fund and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to
Section 2.1(a) or Section 2.2 shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation.



iii.The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver
the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(a)
out of the Exchange Fund.



b.Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable and in any event not
later than the second (2nd) Business Day after the Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (except to the extent representing Excluded
Company Common Stock or Dissenting Shares) which, in each case, were converted
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time
pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section
2.3(f)) or a Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together
with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share (other than the Excluded Company Common Stock and Dissenting Shares) shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such
holder has the right to receive in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (subject to
deduction for withholding Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with
Section 2.3(g)), and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall
forthwith be immediately canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing
such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration.



c.Further Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration paid or
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.3(f)) or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.



d.No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any amounts (whether in respect of such Company
Common Stock or otherwise) delivered from the Exchange Fund or otherwise to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



e.Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts earned with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other
than shares of Excluded Company Common Stock or Dissenting Shares) on the date
that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who
have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
representing such shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for exchange pursuant to
the provisions of this Section 2.3 shall thereafter look for payment of the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares solely to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as general creditors thereof, for any
claim to the applicable Merger Consideration (without interest) to which such
holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1(a) (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws and any deduction for withholding Taxes required by applicable
Law in accordance with Section 2.3(g)).



f.Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable thereon pursuant to Section 2.1(a) without any interest
thereon (subject to any deduction for withholding Taxes required by applicable
Law in accordance with Section 2.3(g)).



g.Withholding. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation (and any of
their respective Subsidiaries) and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company RSU Awards, or
other Person, such amounts as Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
(and any of their respective Subsidiaries) or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, are required to deduct and withhold under any applicable provision
of Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. If any deduction or
withholding may be avoided or reduced by such Person providing information or
documentation to the applicable payor, the parties shall cooperate to use
commercially reasonable efforts to legally avoid or reduce such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation (and any of their respective Subsidiaries)
or the Exchange Agent and remitted to the appropriate Tax Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation (and any of their
respective Subsidiaries) or the Exchange Agent, as applicable.



Section 2.4 Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who has
not voted in favor of the Merger and who properly demands appraisal of such
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or exchangeable for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall be converted into the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to the holders of
Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL, unless and until such holders shall
have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such
holder's right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares
shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal
and/or payment, each such share of Company Common Stock of such holder shall
thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to
receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to
appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(a) without any interest thereon
(subject to any deduction for withholding Taxes required by applicable Law in
accordance with Section 2.3(g)). The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
withdrawals (or attempted withdrawals) of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to rights of appraisal, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer to settle or settle any such
demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.



Section 2.5 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise
provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation for
transfer (other than shares of Excluded Company Common Stock or Dissenting
Shares) shall be canceled and exchanged for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration applicable thereto, including a cash amount in immediately
available funds equal to the Closing Date Per Share Merger Consideration to
which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(a).



Section 2.6 Company ESPP. The Company shall take all actions as may be
necessary to terminate the Company ESPP after the completion of the offering
period that ends on December 31, 2020.

Article 3.

Parent simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule"), the Company represents and warrants to Parent as
follows:

Section 3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware. Each Company Subsidiary has been duly
organized, and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be. Each of

and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of
the Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for
such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that have not
had or would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all of the Company
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth in Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary holds an Equity Interest in any other Person.

treasury of the Company or by the Company Subsidiaries and (iii) there were

arrangements and agreements set forth in Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no options, warrants, stock appreciation rights,
redemption rights, repurchase rights or other rights, agreements, arrangements
or commitments of any character to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary

a.In the past three (3) years, the Company has timely filed or otherwise
furnished (as applicable) all registration statements, prospectuses, forms,
reports, definitive proxy statements, schedules and documents required to be
filed by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be
(collectively, the "Company SEC Filings"). Each Company SEC Filing (i) as of
its date, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not, at
the time it was filed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that no
representation is made as to the accuracy of any financial projections or
forward-looking statements or the completeness of any information furnished by
the Company to the SEC solely for the purposes of complying with Regulation FD
promulgated under the Exchange Act. As of the date of this Agreement, no
Company Subsidiary is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act. b.Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any
notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Filings was prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and, in the
case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q
under the Exchange Act) on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and each presented fairly
the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of
the Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end adjustments). The books
and records of the Company and each Company Subsidiary have been, and are
being, maintained in accordance with applicable legal and accounting
requirements.



c.The Company has designed and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the

Subsidiaries. The Company (i) has designed and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and (ii) since December 31, 2017 has disclosed to the Company's
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (1) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the Company's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (2) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. The Company
has made available to Parent a summary of any such disclosure made by
management to the Company's auditors and audit committee since December 31,
2017.

the form of a personal loan to any executive officer or director of the
Company.



Section 3.8 Disclosure Documents.

the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws. 

b.The Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended, if applicable, at the time
such Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed to
stockholders of the Company, at the time such stockholders vote on adoption of
this Agreement, and at the Effective Time and (ii) any Other Filings or any
supplement or amendment thereto, at the time of the filing thereof and at the
time of any distribution or dissemination thereof, in each case, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no

statements therein based on information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement or (2) any financial projections or forward-
looking statements.

expected to result in any claims against, or obligations or liabilities of,
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and (ii) would be required to
be reflected on a balance sheet or in notes thereto prepared in accordance
with GAAP, except for liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business since December 31, 2019, and that, individually or in the
aggregate, are not and would not reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Merger or (B) otherwise be material to

consistent with past practice and, since such date, there has not been (a) any
Company Material Adverse Effect or (b) any action taken by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary during the period from January 1, 2020 through the date of
this Agreement that, if taken during the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of Section
5.1.

current or former employees, directors, officers or consultants of the Company
or any Company Subsidiaries and/or their dependents or to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary has any material liability on or after the Effective

identified on Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule each Employee
Plan that is maintained, sponsored, contributed to, or required to be

including any material amendments thereto; (B) the most recent annual report

applicable Law); (C) the most recent summary plan description for each
Employee Plan for which a summary plan description is required by applicable
Law and all related summaries of material modifications; (D) the most recent

actuarial report, if any, and financial statement in connection with each such

b.Except as has not had or would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) (A) each
Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code either has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or may
rely upon a favorable prototype opinion letter from the IRS as to its
qualified status, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred
since the date of the latest favorable determination letter or prototype
opinion letter, as applicable, that would reasonably be expected to cause the
loss of qualification of any such Employee Plan and (B) all outstanding
participant loans under such Employee Plans are in good standing, (ii) each
Employee Plan has been maintained and administered in material compliance,
with ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws, and (iii) in the last three
(3) years, other than routine claims for benefits, there are no suits, claims,
proceedings, actions, governmental audits or investigations that are pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or involving any Employee Plan. Except as has not had or
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan that is intended
to qualify for favorable Tax benefits under the Laws of any jurisdiction is so
qualified and/or properly registered, as applicable, has been maintained in
good standing with all applicable regulatory authorities, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists or event has occurred that could
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation or loss of such status. c.No Employee Plan is, and none of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates
sponsors, maintains or contributes to, or has, within the past six (6) years,
established, sponsored, maintained or contributed to, or in any way has any
current or potential liability, directly or indirectly, with respect to any
plan that is, (i) a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) or
4001(a)(3) of ERISA or Section 414(f) of the Code) (a "Multiemployer Plan") or
(ii) subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412, 430 or 4971
of the Code or a "defined benefit" plan within the meaning of Section 414(j)
of the Code or Section 3(35) of ERISA (whether or not subject thereto).



d.No Employee Plan provides, or reflects or represents any liability to
provide, for post-retirement welfare benefits, other than (i) health care
continuation coverage required by Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA") or other
applicable Law, (ii) coverage through the end of the calendar month in which a
termination of employment occurs or (iii) pursuant to an applicable agreement,
plan or policy requiring the Company or any Company Subsidiary to pay or
subsidize COBRA premiums for a terminated employee following the employee's

e.Except as set forth in Section 3.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or
required by the terms of this Agreement, neither the execution by the Company
of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will (either alone or upon occurrence of any additional or subsequent events):
(i) entitle any current or former employee, consultant or director of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to any payment of compensation; (ii)
increase the amount of compensation or benefits due to any such employee,
consultant or director; (iii) accelerate the vesting, funding or time of
payment of any compensation, equity award or other benefit; (iv) limit or

Company or any Company Subsidiary, all amounts paid or payable to current or
former employees, directors, officers or consultants of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and/or their dependents in accordance with the terms of an
Employee Plan that is the subject of Section 409A of the Code have been or
will be, as applicable, compliant with Section 409A of the Code.

Subsidiary is or has been the subject of any pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened proceeding alleging that the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has engaged in any unfair labor practice under any Law and (ii)
there is and has been no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened labor strike, dispute, walkout, work stoppage, slowdown or lockout

Subsidiary who is working in the United States is a United States citizen or

incorporation or organization and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement, Merger Sub has not and will not have
incurred, directly or indirectly, through any Subsidiary or Affiliate, any
obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type
or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any Section 4.7 Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the Merger
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary.

Section 4.8 Financing.



Parent has received and accepted, and delivered to the Company, a true,
correct and complete copy of: (i) an executed equity commitment letter, dated
December 10, 2020, among Parent and the other parties thereto (collectively,
the "Investors") (together with all annexes, schedules and exhibits thereto,
and any fee letters relating thereto, the "Equity Commitment Letter") relating
to the commitment to provide Parent the amount of equity financing set forth
therein (the "Equity Financing"); and (ii) executed debt commitment letters
dated December 10, 2020 (together with all annexes, schedules and exhibits
thereto, and any fee letters relating thereto (redacted, in the case of such
fee letters, in a customary manner, including with respect to the amounts and
percentages of the fees and other economic terms and "flex" terms set forth
therein, which redacted information does not adversely affect the amount,
availability or conditionality of the Debt Financing), the "Debt Commitment
Letters" and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter, collectively, the
"Commitment Letters") from the Debt Financing Sources party thereto relating
to the commitment of such Debt Financing Sources to provide the debt financing
in the amounts set forth therein to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement on the terms contemplated thereby; provided, that the
economic terms in a copy of any fee letter delivered pursuant hereto may be
redacted. The debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters is
collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "Debt Financing" and,
together with the Equity Financing, the "Financing". As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no side letters or other contracts or arrangements that
would limit the funding of the full amount of the Financing other than as
expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters provided to the Company on or
prior to the date hereof.



a.Except as set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no conditions
precedent to the obligations of the counterparties thereto (including, with
respect to the Debt Commitment Letters and to the extent applicable, pursuant
to any "flex" provisions in the related fee letter or otherwise) to provide
the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the counterparties
thereto to reduce the total amount of the below the Required Amount (as
defined below). Assuming the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section
6.2 are satisfied, as of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term
or condition to Closing to be satisfied by it in the Commitment Letters or
that the Required Amount of the Financing will not be made available, on the
Closing Date. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies to the
funding of the Financing other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters. No
Person has any right to impose, and none of the Debt Financing Sources under
the Debt Commitment Letters or Parent has any obligation to accept, any
condition precedent to such funding other than any of the conditions expressly
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters nor any reduction to the aggregate
amount available under the Debt Commitment Letters on the Closing Date below
the Required Amount, except as expressly provided therein (nor any term or
condition which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount available under the Debt Commitment Letters on
the Closing Date below the Required Amount, except as expressly provided
therein).

b.Assuming the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 are
satisfied, the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment
Letters, shall provide Parent with immediately available cash on the Closing
Date sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub, together with available cash and
cash equivalents of the Company, to fund the Closing Date Per Share Merger
Consideration, and any other cash amounts payable by Parent and Merger Sub at
the Closing in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and to pay all related fees and
expenses of Parent and Merger Sub required to be paid at Closing in connection
therewith (the "Required Amount").

c.Each Commitment Letter is the legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of Parent, the Investors (as applicable) and, to the knowledge of
Parent, each other party thereto and is in full force and effect (except to
the extent that its enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other similar Law affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles). Parent is not
in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in the Commitment
Letters and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time,
or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a
failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent under the terms
and conditions of such Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, no Commitment
Letter has been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended or
modified in any respect, and no such amendment or modification is
contemplated, other than, in the case of the Debt Commitment Letters, any
joinders which do not alter the terms thereof except for the purposes of
joining additional Debt Financing Sources that have not executed the Debt
Commitment Letters as of the date hereof. As of the date of this Agreement, no
counterparty to any Commitment Letter has notified Parent of its intention to
terminate such Commitment Letter or not to provide such Financing. Parent has
paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees and expenses required
to be paid by Parent on or before the date of this Agreement pursuant to the
terms of the Commitment Letters.



d.Each of Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledges and agrees that the
receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent or any
other financing or other transactions is not a condition to any of Parent's
(or its Affiliates') obligations hereunder (including its and Merger Sub's
obligations to consummate the Merger).



Section 4.9 Solvency. Assuming: (a) that the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries are Solvent (on a consolidated basis) immediately prior to the
Effective Time; (b) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section
6.1 and Section 6.2; (c) the accuracy of the Company's representations and
warranties set forth in Article 3 (without giving effect to any materiality,
Knowledge or Company Material Adverse Effect qualification or exception
contained therein) and the compliance by the Company with its covenants set
forth in Article 5, in each case, in all material respects; and (d) the consummation of the Debt
Financing, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, after giving
effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the payment of the Merger Consideration and the RSU Consideration),
be Solvent at and immediately after the Effective Time. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Solvent" means that, as of any date of determination
and with respect to any Person and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis):
(x) the sum of the debt (including contingent liabilities) of such Person and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, does not exceed the present fair saleable
value of the present assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, (y) the capital of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
is not unreasonably small in relation to the business of such Person and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (z) such Person and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, do not have debts including current obligations beyond their
ability to pay or refinance such debts as they mature in the ordinary course
of business.



Section 4.10 Interested Stockholder. Neither Parent nor any of the Parent
Subsidiaries is, or has been at any time during the period commencing three
(3) years prior to the date hereof through the date hereof, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company, as such term is defined in Section 203 of the
DGCL.

Section 4.11 Sponsor Guaranty. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct
copy of the executed Sponsor Guaranty. The Sponsor Guaranty is valid, binding
and enforceable in accordance with its terms, and is in full force and effect,
and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or
both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a
failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Guarantor under the
terms and conditions of the Sponsor Guaranty.

Section 4.12 Stockholder and Management Arrangements. As of the date of this
Agreement, other than the Support Agreements, none of Parent, Merger Sub nor
any of their respective Affiliates nor any party to the Equity Commitment
Letter or any Affiliate of any such party is a party to any Contract with any
holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to which such holder of Company Common
Stock (i) would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or
nature than the Merger Consideration in respect of such holder's shares of
Company Common Stock, (ii) has agreed to approve this Agreement or vote
against any Superior Proposal, or (iii) has agreed to provide, directly or
indirectly, an equity investment to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to
finance any portion of the Merger.

representations and warranties set forth in this Article 4, the applicable
Ancillary Agreements, any certificates delivered by Parent or Merger Sub to
the Company neither Parent nor Merger Sub or any other Person makes or has
made any express or implied representation or warranty, at law or in equity,

respective businesses, assets, liabilities, operations, prospects or condition
(financial or otherwise) or with respect to any other information provided to
the Company or Company Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Except for the representations and warranties set forth in Article 4, the applicable Ancillary Agreements, any
certificates delivered by Parent or Merger Sub to the Company, the Company and
Company Subsidiaries specifically disclaim that they are relying upon or have
relied upon any representations or warranties, and acknowledge and agree that
Parent and Merger Sub have specifically disclaimed and do hereby specifically
disclaim any such representation or warranty made by any Person. The Company
and Company Subsidiaries specifically disclaim any obligation or duty by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person to make any disclosures of fact not
required to be disclosed pursuant to the specific representations and
warranties set forth in this Article 4 or the applicable Ancillary Agreements.

Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto)
or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with
respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response (which comments
shall be provided promptly and be considered in good faith; provided that the
Company shall be under no obligation to incorporate such comments). b.Parent shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Merger Sub as may be reasonably requested by the Company in
connection with the Proxy Statement, including such information that is
required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement, and shall otherwise
reasonably assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the SEC (or the staff of
the SEC). Parent will, upon request of the Company, confirm and/or supplement
the information relating to Parent or Merger Sub supplied by it for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement, such that at the time of the mailing of the Proxy
Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the
Company Stockholder Meeting, such information shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.



c.The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, (x) establish a
record date for and give notice of a meeting of its stockholders, for the
purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the "Company Stockholder Meeting") and
(y) mail to the holders of Company Common Stock as of the record date
established for the Company Stockholder Meeting a Proxy Statement (such
mailing date, the "Proxy Date"). The Company shall duly call, convene and hold
the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Proxy Date; provided, however, that, without the prior written consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company
Stockholder Meeting shall not be held later than twenty-five (25) Business
Days after the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC; provided, further,
that the Company may postpone, recess or adjourn the Company Stockholder
Meeting: (i) with the consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), (ii) for the absence of a quorum, (iii) to solicit
additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Required Company
Stockholder Approval, or (iv) to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and distribution of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the
Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) is necessary under applicable Laws and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by the
Company's stockholders prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Unless the
Company Board shall have effected a Change of Board Recommendation, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit proxies in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement.



d.If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance
relating to the Company or Parent or any of the Company's or Parent's
Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors, is discovered by the
Company or Parent, respectively, which, pursuant to the Exchange Act, should
be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, such
party shall promptly inform the others. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees to correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement which shall have become false or misleading. Section 5.3 Access to Information; Confidentiality.



a.Upon reasonable notice, during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall,
and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and each of the Company
Representatives to (i) provide to Parent and Merger Sub and the Parent
Representatives access, at reasonable times and upon prior notice, to the
Company Representatives and the properties, offices and other facilities of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof
and (ii) furnish promptly such information concerning the business,
properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request;
provided that such investigation shall only be upon reasonable notice and
shall be at Parent's sole cost and expense; and provided further, that any
such access shall be subject to feasibility/permissibility under applicable
Law (including any COVID-19 Measures). No investigation conducted pursuant to
this Section 5.3 shall affect or be deemed to modify or limit any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement.



b.With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to Section 5.3(a), the
parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to
comply with, all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of November 9, 2020, previously executed by the Company
and Evercel, Inc. (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). c.This Section 5.3 shall not require the Company to permit any access, or to
disclose any information (i) that in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of the
Company would reasonably be expected to result in any violation of any
Contract or Law to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a
party or is subject or cause any privilege (including attorney-client
privilege) that the Company or any Company Subsidiary would be entitled to
assert to be undermined with respect to such information and such undermining
of such privilege could in the Company's good faith judgment (after
consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) adversely affect in
any material respect the Company's position in any pending or, what the
Company believes in good faith (after consultation with counsel, which may be
in-house counsel) could be, future litigation or (ii) if the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties
in a litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent thereto; provided
that, in the case of the immediately preceding clause (i), the parties hereto
shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such
information (including by entering into a joint-defense or similar agreement)
to the extent doing so (A) would not (in the good faith belief of the Company
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) reasonably
be likely to result in the violation of any such Contract or Law or reasonably
be likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to such
information or (B) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the Company
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed
through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-
employee Representatives of the other party shall be provided access to such
information; provided, further, that the Company shall (1) notify Parent and
Merger Sub that such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or any
Company Subsidiaries' obligations under any such Contract or Law or are
reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be undermined and (2) communicate
to Parent and Merger Sub in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such
notification and the subject matter of such information (to the extent it is
able to do so in accordance with the first proviso in this Section 5.3(c)).



Section 5.4 Solicitation of Transactions.



a.Subject to Section 5.4(b), from and after the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article 7, the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries not to, and shall instruct the Company Representatives not to on
behalf of the Company: (i) initiate, solicit or encourage the submission of
any Acquisition Proposal or engage in any discussions or negotiations with
respect thereto (other than informing any Third Party of the existence of the
provisions contained in this Section 5.4), provided, however, that the Company
may (A) ascertain facts from any Person making an Acquisition Proposal for the
purpose of the Company Board informing itself about such Acquisition Proposal
and the Third Party making it and (B) waive, and hereby does waive, any
standstill restrictions contained in any confidentiality agreement or other
similar agreements, (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve
or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) withdraw, change or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Board Recommendation, (iv) enter into or negotiate any merger agreement,
letter of intent or other similar agreement relating to any Acquisition
Proposal (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"), or (v) resolve or agree to
do any of the foregoing (any action set forth in the foregoing clause (ii),
(iii) or (iv) (to the extent related to the foregoing clause (ii) or (iii)), a
"Change of Board Recommendation", which term shall also include any action
described in clauses (ii) and (iii) in connection with an Intervening Event as
provided in Section 5.4(f)). From and after the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article 7, the Company shall cease and cause to be terminated
any discussion or negotiation with any Persons conducted prior to the date
hereof by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of the Company
Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

b.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a), (i) if
at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to receipt of the
Required Company Stockholder Approval (A) the Company or any of its
Representatives has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a
Third Party, (B) the Company has not breached this Section 5.4 in any material
respect with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and (C) the Company Board
(or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, based on
information then available, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then (ii) as to
each such Third Party, in each case, the Company may (A) furnish information
with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Third Party
making such Acquisition Proposal, its Representatives and potential sources of
financing and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Third
Party making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal;
provided that the Company (1) will not, and will cause the Company
Subsidiaries not to and will instruct the Company Representatives not to,
disclose any information to such Person without first entering into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and (2) will, to the
extent the Company reasonably deems not to be in violation of applicable Law
(including Competition Law), provide to Parent any material information
concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries provided or made available
to such other Person which was not previously provided or made available to
Parent as promptly as practicable.



c.If, at any time following the date of this Agreement, any Company
Representative receives any Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) provide Parent with a copy of
such Acquisition Proposal (which copy may be redacted to omit any information
regarding the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal) or
provide Parent with a summary of an oral Acquisition Proposal and, without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours after such determination) advise Parent if the Company
determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 5.4(b). d.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(b), if the
Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board (or
any duly authorized committee thereof) determines, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal (or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal), the Company
Board may at any time prior to receipt of the Required Company Stockholder
Approval, (i) effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such
Superior Proposal or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in any
disclosure to stockholders required by Rule 14d-9 and/or (ii) terminate this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, in either case subject to the requirements of this Section 5.4(d)
and Article 7. The Company shall not be entitled to effect a Change of Board
Recommendation pursuant to this Section 5.4(d) or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 5.4(d) and Section 7.1(f) unless the Company shall
have provided to Parent at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice
(the "Notice Period") of the Company's intention to take such action, which
notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal (which shall not be required to include the identity of the party
making such Acquisition Proposal), and shall have provided to Parent a copy of
the available proposed transaction agreement to be entered into in respect of
such Acquisition Proposal (which copy may be redacted to omit any information
regarding the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal), and



i.during the Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have,
and shall have caused the Company Representatives to have, engaged in good
faith negotiations with Parent regarding any amendment to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and intended to cause the relevant proposal to
no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and



ii.the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) shall have
considered any adjustments and/or proposed amendments to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) and the other agreements
contemplated hereby that may be irrevocably offered in writing by Parent (the
"Proposed Changed Terms") no later than 11:59 a.m., New York City time, on the
last day of the Notice Period and shall have determined in good faith that the
Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect.



e.In the event of any material revisions to such Superior Proposal offered in
writing by the party making such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply (but
only on two (2) additional occasions) with the requirements of this Section
5.4(d) with respect to such new written notice, except that the Notice Period
shall be twenty-four (24) hours with respect to any such revised Superior
Proposal, but no such new written notice shall shorten the original Notice
Period. f.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a), the
Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) may at any time prior
to receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval effect a Change of
Board Recommendation if (i) the Company Board (or any duly authorized
committee thereof) determines that an Intervening Event has occurred and is
continuing and (ii) the Company Board (or such duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that the failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to
such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company.



g.Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Company Board (or
any duly authorized committee thereof) from (i) disclosing to the stockholders
of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties. The issuance by the Company or the Company Board of
a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation.



Section 5.5 Consummation of the Merger.



a.Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the Pre-
Closing Period, each of Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, will cooperate with the other and use (and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary,
proper or advisable to cause the conditions to the Closing to be satisfied as
promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) and
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably
practicable, the Merger, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notifications, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications
and other documents (including any required or recommended filings under
applicable Competition Laws), (ii) obtain promptly (and in any event no later
than the Outside Date) all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, registrations, permits, authorizations and
other confirmations from any Governmental Entity or Third Party necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and (iii) obtain all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, nothing in this Agreement shall require the
Company to pay any consideration to a Third Party from whom consent, approval
or waiver is requested.

b.In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto
agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) days after the date of this Agreement and to supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested by any Governmental Entity pursuant to the HSR
Act or any other Competition Law and use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken (including by their respective Subsidiaries), all
other actions consistent with this Section 5.5 reasonably necessary to cause
the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date).



c.Each of the parties hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry
by or before a Governmental Entity relating to the Merger, including any
proceeding initiated by a private Person, (ii) promptly inform the other party
of (and supply to the other party) any communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Entity and
any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding
by a private Person, in each case, regarding the Merger, (iii) permit the
other parties to review in advance and incorporate the other parties'
reasonable comments in any filing or other communication to be given by it to
any Governmental Entity with respect to obtaining any clearances required
under any Competition Law in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and (iv) consult with the other parties in advance of any meeting or
teleconference with any Governmental Entity or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private Person, with any other Person, and, to the extent not
prohibited by the Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other parties
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
teleconferences. Subject to Section 5.3, the parties hereto will use
commercially reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense
privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this Section 5.5(c) in a manner
so as to preserve the applicable privilege.



d.Parent agrees to take, or cause to be taken (including by any Affiliates of
Parent), any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made (including by any
Affiliates of Parent), any and all undertakings necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, that a Governmental Entity may assert under any
Competition Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Competition Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger, in each
case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and in
any event no later than the Outside Date, including (i) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any businesses,
assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of Parent (or any
Affiliates of Parent) or the Surviving Corporation or any equity interest in
any joint venture held by Parent (or any Affiliates of Parent) or the
Surviving Corporation, (ii) creating, terminating or divesting relationships,
ventures, contractual rights or obligations of Parent (or of any of the
Affiliates of Parent), or the Surviving Corporation and (iii) otherwise taking or committing to take any action that would limit Parent's
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly
or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties of Parent (including any of the Affiliates of Parent) or the
Surviving Corporation or any equity interest in any joint venture held by
Parent (or any of the Affiliates of Parent) or the Surviving Corporation, in
each case, as may be required in order to obtain all approvals, consents,
clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, registrations,
permits, authorizations and other confirmations required directly or
indirectly under any Competition Law or to avoid the commencement of any
action to prohibit the transactions contemplated hereby under any Competition
Law, or, in the alternative, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any action or proceeding seeking to prohibit the Merger or delay the Closing
beyond the Outside Date. Any agreement entered into by Parent prior to the
Closing with respect to any transaction to divest, hold separate or otherwise
take any action that limits the Surviving Corporation's freedom of action,
ownership or control with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold,
directly or indirectly, any of the businesses, assets, equity interests,
product lines or properties of the Surviving Corporation or any equity
interest in any joint venture held by the Surviving Corporation (each, a
"Divestiture Action") shall provide that the consummation of the transactions
provided for in any such agreement for a Divestiture Action will be
conditioned upon the Closing or satisfaction of all of the conditions to the
Closing in a case where the Closing will occur immediately following such
Divestiture Action (and where Parent has irrevocably committed to effect the
Closing immediately following such Divestiture Action).



e. In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.5, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private Person, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger as violative of any
Competition Law, each of Parent and the Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger.



Section 5.6 Certain Notices. During the Pre-Closing Period, each party hereto
shall, promptly after obtaining Knowledge of an event set forth in this
Section 5.6, notify the other party hereto of (i) the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event that would be reasonably likely to cause any
condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement not to
be satisfied or (ii) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
which would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the
obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement not to be satisfied;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
5.6 shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to
the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.



Section 5.7 Public Announcements. Without limiting any other provision of this
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall consult with the other and
issue a joint press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement.
Thereafter, neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries, shall issue any press release or other announcement (to the
extent not previously publicly disclosed or made in accordance with this
Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or the Merger without the prior
consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except (a) as such press release or other
announcement may be required by applicable Law or the applicable rules of a
national securities exchange, in which case the party required to issue the
release or make the announcement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such release or announcement in advance of its issuance, (b) that each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries may make announcements from time to time
to their respective employees, customers, suppliers and other business
relations and otherwise as the Company may reasonably determine is necessary
to comply with applicable Law or the requirements of any agreement to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or (c) in connection with
Change of Board Recommendation if and to the extent permitted by the terms of
this Agreement.



Section 5.8 Employee Benefit Matters.



a.Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent and its Affiliates
shall recognize, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize, each
Continuing Employee's employment or service with the Company (including any
current or former Affiliate thereof or any predecessor of the Company) prior
to the Closing for all purposes, including for purposes of determining, as
applicable, eligibility for participation, vesting and entitlement of the
Continuing Employee under all employee benefit plans maintained by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, including
vacation plans or arrangements, 401(k) or other retirement plans and any
severance or welfare plans, except to the extent such recognition would result
in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent
and its Affiliates shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use
commercially reasonable efforts to, (a) cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations, eligibility waiting periods, actively at work requirements,
evidence of insurability requirements or required physical examinations under
any health or similar plan of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates applicable to any Continuing Employees to be
waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents,
except to the extent that any waiting period, exclusions or requirements still
applied to such Continuing Employee under the comparable Employee Plan in
which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective
Time, and (b) fully credit each Continuing Employee with all deductible
payments, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under the medical,
dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plans of the Company prior to the
Closing during the plan year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of
determining the extent to which such Continuing Employee has satisfied the
deductible, co-payments, or maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for such plan year
under any medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plan of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such plan.



b.The provisions of this Section 5.8 are solely for the benefit of the parties
to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.8 shall
create such rights in any such Persons. Nothing herein shall (a) guarantee
employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to
terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time and for any
reason; (b) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates, as applicable, to continue any Employee Plans, or other
employee benefit plans or arrangements or prevent the amendment, modification
or termination thereof after the Effective Time; or (c) amend any Employee
Plans or other employee benefit plans or arrangements.



Section 5.9 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.



a.Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer, trustee,
employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or indemnification
agreement, the Company Certificate and the Company By-laws, this Agreement or,
if applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of the
Company Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, will: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each Person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to
the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, solely when acting in his, her or its capacity as a
director, officer, employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or when
acting in his, her or its capacity as a member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or
other employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether or not such other entity or
enterprise is affiliated with the Company) at the request of or on behalf of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (together with such Person's heirs,
executors or administrators collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law in connection with
any Claim or Action against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
Indemnification Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement, including all interest, assessments and other charges paid,
arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within fifteen (15) days after
any request for advancement, an advance to each of the Indemnified Parties
(provided that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification) any Indemnification Expenses incurred in defending or serving
as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any
Claim or Action in advance of the final disposition of such Claim or Action.
The indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this Section 5.9(a) extend to acts or omissions
occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim or Action relating
thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection
therewith and any Claim or Action relating thereto), and all rights to
indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder continue as to any
Indemnified Party who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary after the date hereof and inure to the benefit of such
person's heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As used in
this Section 5.9: (A) the term "Claim" means any threatened, asserted, pending
or completed Action, whether instituted by any Governmental Entity or any
other Person, that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to
the institution of any Action, arising out of or pertaining to matters that
relate to such Indemnified Party's duties or service as a director or officer
of the Company or of any of the Company Subsidiaries or as a trustee of (or in
a similar capacity with) any compensation and benefit plan of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries; (B) the term "Indemnification Expenses" means
reasonable attorneys' fees and all other costs, expenses and obligations
(including experts' fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript
fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications,
postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending being a witness in or participating in (including on
appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate
in, any Claim for which indemnification is sought pursuant to this Section
5.10(a), including any Action relating to a claim for indemnification or
advancement brought by an Indemnified Party; and (C) the phrase "to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law" includes, but is not
limited to (1) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any provision
of the DGCL that authorizes or permits additional indemnification by agreement
or otherwise, or the corresponding provision of any amendment to or
replacement of the DGCL and (2) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted
by any amendments to or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of
this Agreement that increase the extent to which an entity may indemnify its
directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries or Persons
serving in any capacity in which any Indemnified Party serves. Any amendment,
alteration or repeal of the DGCL that adversely affects any right of any
Indemnified Party will be prospective only and does not limit or eliminate any
such right with respect to any Claim or Action involving any occurrence or
alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to
such amendment or repeal. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or
threatened Claim or Action in respect of which indemnification has been or
could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement,
compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Claim or Action without admission or finding of wrongdoing, or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

b.Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing
in favor of the indemnitees as provided in the Company Certificate or the
Company By-laws and indemnification agreements of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary will be assumed by the Surviving Corporation and Parent in the
Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and will survive the
Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.



c.For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation, by-laws, limited liability company agreements and similar
organizational documents, as applicable, of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries will contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation and limitations on
liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the certificate of
incorporation, by-laws, limited liability company agreements and similar
organizational documents, as applicable, of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner
that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or
prior to the Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such
modification is required by Law and then only to the minimum extent required
by Law; provided, however, that any such modification shall be prospective
only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Claim
or Action involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or
omission to act that took place prior to such modification; and provided,
further, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending
or asserted or any Claim made within such period continue until the
disposition of such Action or resolution of such Claim.



d.Parent shall purchase and pay for a "tail" insurance policy to become
effective at the Effective Time with a claims period of at least six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect
to directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance and with benefits and levels of coverage no less favorable as the
Company's existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); provided, however, that in
no event shall Parent be required to expend for such policies a premium amount
in excess of the amount set forth in Section 5.9(d) the Company Disclosure
Schedule.



e.If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and
is not the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.



f.The obligations of Parent under this Section 5.9 will not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Person to whom this
Section 5.9 applies without the written consent of such affected Person.



g.Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of its
obligations under this Section 5.9.



h.This Section 5.9 survives the consummation of the Merger and is intended to
be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and personal representatives, and will be binding on
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns.



Section 5.10 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause any
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)

requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.



Section 5.11 Financing.



a.No Amendments to Commitment Letters. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant
to, the Commitment Letters without the prior written consent of the Company,
if such amendment, modification or waiver would (i) reduce the amount of the
Equity Financing, or reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below
the amount necessary to consummate the Merger, (ii) impose new or additional
conditions or other terms to the Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing, in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger, or (iii) materially and adversely impact the
ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (solely with respect to the
Equity Commitment Letter), to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the Commitment Letters; provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, Parent may
amend any of the Debt Commitment Letters or any definitive agreement related
to the Debt Financing to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers
or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the
date of this Agreement and amend titles, allocations and fee arrangements with
respect to the existing and additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners,
agents, managers or similar entities. b.Equity Financing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each of Parent and Merger Sub will use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper and advisable to arrange and obtain the Equity Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Equity Commitment Letter, including
using its reasonable best efforts to:



i.maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions thereof;



ii.satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding that are applicable to
Parent and Merger Sub in the Equity Commitment Letter; and



iii.if the conditions to funding therein have been satisfied or waived,
consummate the Equity Financing at or prior to the Closing, including by
causing the parties to the Equity Commitment Letter to fund the Equity
Financing at the Closing.



c.Debt Financing. Each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to arrange the Debt
Financing and to consummate the Debt Financing on the Closing Date in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters (including, to the
extent required, the full exercise of any flex provisions), including using
its reasonable best efforts to:



i.maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions thereof;



ii.comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letters;



iii.negotiate, execute and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters;



iv.satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, on a timely basis (or obtain a waiver
to) all conditions to funding that are applicable to Parent, Merger Sub and
Guarantor in the Debt Commitment Letters that are within its control; and



v.if the conditions to funding therein have been satisfied or waived, and upon
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the fulfilment or waiver of such conditions), consummate the
Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Debt Financing Sources committing to fund the Debt
Financing to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing; provided, however, that
neither Parent nor the Merger Sub shall be required to commence or pursue
litigation, and the Company does not have the right to compel Parent or the
Merger Sub to commence or pursue litigation, to enforce the obligations of the Debt Financing Sources to fund
the Debt Financing.



d.Information. Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis of material developments in their
efforts to arrange the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company notice as promptly as
practicable of (i) any material breach or repudiation by any party to the
Commitment Letters of which it becomes aware if such breach could reasonably
be expected to result in a material delay of the Closing Date, (ii) the
receipt of any written notice of termination of any Commitment Letter or (iii)
any material dispute or disagreement among any parties to a Commitment Letter
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include disputes arising in the
good faith ordinary course negotiation of the documents related to the Debt
Financing); provided, that in no event will Parent and Merger Sub be under any
obligation to disclose any information that Parent and Merger Sub determine,
in good faith and after consultation with their outside legal counsel(s),
would result in any violation or breach of any applicable legal privileges
(including attorney-client privilege) and confidentiality obligations if so
disclosed.



e.Alternative Debt Financing. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in any of the Debt
Commitment Letters, Parent shall, as promptly as practicable, notify the
Company of such event and the reasons therefor and use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain alternative financing ("Alternative Debt Financing") on
terms and conditions not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to
Parent (as determined by Parent in good faith) than those set forth in such
Debt Commitment Letter and in an amount, when added to the portion of the
Financing being replaced that is still available, such that the aggregate
funds available to Parent at Closing will be sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that Parent obtains
Alternative Debt Financing pursuant to this Section 5.11(e), references to the
"Debt Financing," the "Financing," the "Debt Commitment Letters" and the
"Commitment Letters" (and other like terms in this Agreement) shall be deemed
to be modified to refer to such Alternative Debt Financing.

Affiliate of Parent or any other financing or other transactions is not a
condition to any of Parent's (or its Affiliates') obligations hereunder
(including its and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the Merger). If the
Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to
be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set

and the Company will exercise, consistent with the terms, conditions and
restrictions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its own
business and operations.

Section 5.16 Anti-Takeover Laws. The Company and the Company Board (and any
committee empowered to take such action, if applicable) will (a) take all
reasonable actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover"
statute or similar statute or regulation (or, in the case of Section 203 of

becomes applicable to the Merger; and (b) if any "anti-takeover" statute or
similar statute or regulation (or, in the case of Section 203 of the DGCL, the
restrictions on "business combinations" contained therein) becomes applicable
to the Merger, take all reasonable action within their power to ensure that
the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger.

relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Documents, or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and (c) agrees not to commence
(and, if commenced, agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate, and not to
assist) any Action against any of the Debt Financing Sources (and/or any of
their respective Affiliates and/or Representatives) in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Documents, or the transactions

Section 7.2 Effect of Termination.



a.Limitation on Liability. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries,
officers or directors except with respect to Section 5.3 (Access to
Information; Confidentiality), Section 5.7 (Public Announcements), Section
5.17 (No Recourse to Debt Financing Sources), this Section 7.2 and Article 8
(General Provisions); provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7.2
relieves any of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company of any liability for fraud
or as provided in the Confidentiality Agreement, in which case the aggrieved
party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in b.Termination Fee.



i.In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
7.1(e), then the Company shall pay to Parent within three (3) Business Days of
such termination a termination fee of $3,000,000 (the "Company Termination
Fee") and shall promptly (and in any event within five Business Days of the
receipt of any request therefor) reimburse Parent for any and all out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing, up to a
maximum of $2,000,000 (the "Expense Reimbursement Obligation").



ii.In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(f), then the Company shall pay to Parent, concurrently with such
termination, the Company Termination Fee and the Company shall also be subject
to the Expense Reimbursement Obligation.



iii.In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(d), (B) an Acquisition
Proposal has been publicly announced and not expressly and publicly withdrawn
prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting (x) prior to the date of termination
with respect to any termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b), and (y) prior to

v.The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2(b)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement, and that neither the Company Termination Fee (or the related
Expense Reimbursement Obligation) nor the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty,
but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which the
Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, is payable.
If the Company or Parent, as applicable, fails to promptly pay the Company
Termination Fee (or satisfy the Expense Reimbursement Obligation) or the Termination Fee when due pursuant to this Section 7.2(b), such amount shall
accrue interest at the annual rate of 5% plus the prime rate as published in

made through the date such payment was actually received, or a lesser rate
that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law. If a party commences an
Action that results in a final, non-appealable judgment against another party
for the Company Termination Fee, the Expense Reimbursement Obligation or the
Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, or any portion of such fees, the
breaching party shall pay to the non-breaching party its reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection
with such Action.



vi.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent's right to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee (and
reimbursement of expenses pursuant to the Expense Reimbursement Obligation)
under the circumstances set forth in this Section 7.2(b) shall be Parent's
sole and exclusive remedy (whether based in contract, tort or strict
liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or
otherwise) against the Company and its Affiliates and any of their respective
current or former Representatives relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated herein (including for any breach or failure
to perform hereunder or otherwise). Upon the Company's payment of the Company
Termination Fee (and satisfaction of the Expense Reimbursement Obligation)
under the circumstances described in Section 7.2(b), none of the Company and
its Affiliates or their respective Representatives shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein under such circumstances. The parties
acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee (or satisfy the Expense Reimbursement Obligation) on
more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be
payable (or the Expense Reimbursement Obligation may become effective)
pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and upon the occurrence of different events.



vii.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company's right to receive (A) payment of the Parent Termination Fee under the
circumstances set forth in this Section 7.2(b) and (B) any indemnification or
expense reimbursement obligations under Section 5.12(d) and Section 5.12(e)
shall be the Company's sole and exclusive remedy (whether based in contract,
tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal
or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable
Laws or otherwise) against Parent and the Debt Financing Sources and any of
their respective Affiliates and any of their respective current or former
Representatives relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein (including for any breach or failure to
perform hereunder or otherwise). Upon Parent's payment of the Parent Termination Fee and any indemnification or
expense reimbursement obligations under Section 5.12(d) and Section 5.12(e),
none of Parent or the Debt Financing Sources or any of their respective
Affiliates or any of their current or former Representatives shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated herein or otherwise. The parties acknowledge
and agree that in no event will Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Parent
Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this
Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of
different events.



viii.For the purposes of this Section 7.2(b), the Affiliates of Parent shall
include any "Funding Party", as such term is defined in the Equity Commitment
Letter.



c.All Payments. All payments under Section 7.2 shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by the party entitled
to receive payment. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
Section 5.17, in the event of termination of this Agreement in accordance with
this Article 7, there shall be no liability on the part of any of the Debt
Financing Sources (and/or any of their respective Affiliates and/or
Representatives). This Section 7.2 is intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Debt Financing Sources and their respective
successors and assigns.



Section 7.3 Limitation on Recourse. Other than with respect to (a) the right
to specific performance of the Equity Commitment Letter to the extent
permitted by and in accordance with Section 8.16 and the Equity Commitment
Letter (any such claims under the Equity Commitment Letter, collectively, the
"ECL Claims"), (b) recourse against Guarantor under the Sponsor Guaranty to
the extent provided therein and (c) the recourse rights of any party pursuant
to the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent provided therein, any claim or
cause of action under this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that
are expressly named as parties, and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth in this Agreement. Other than the ECL Claims, such
recourse against Guarantor under the Sponsor Guaranty and such recourse
against a party under the Confidentiality Agreement, no Affiliate of the
Company or any Company Representative, nor any Affiliate of Parent or any
Parent Representative, shall have any liability or obligation for any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or liabilities
of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or of or for any claim, investigation, or
Action, in each case under, based on, in respect of, or by reason of, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the breach,
termination or failure to consummate such transactions), in each case whether
based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any legal or equitable Action, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise and whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, limited liability company or partnership veil, by
or through a claim by or on behalf of a party or another Person (including a
claim to enforce the Debt Commitment Letters) or otherwise. This Section 7.3
is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Debt
Financing Sources and their respective successors and assigns. Article 8.

THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 8.13(c). THIS SECTION 8.13 IS INTENDED TO BE FOR THE BENEFIT
OF, AND SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE BY, THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES AND THEIR
RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.



Section 8.14 Fees and Expenses. Subject to Section 7.2(a) of this Agreement,
all expenses incurred by the parties hereto shall be borne solely and entirely
by the party which has incurred the same.



Section 8.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar
attachment to email (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"), will be
treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered
to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed
version thereof delivered in person. No party may raise the use of an
Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an
Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each
party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense
relates to lack of authenticity.



Section 8.16 Specific Performance.



a.The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise
breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would
exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and accordingly, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Section 8.16(a) and Section 8.16(b), (i) the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to specific performance of the terms hereof, in each
case in Delaware Court of Chancery, or in the event that the Delaware Court of
Chancery lacks jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District
of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity, (ii) the parties waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any
specific performance or injunctive relief and (iii) the parties will waive, in
any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at
law. The Company's and Parent's pursuit of specific performance at any time
(A) will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to
pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled,
including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or
suffered by such party in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving
fraud and (B) will not restrict, impair or otherwise limit Parent or the
Company from, in the alternative and as applicable, seeking to terminate the
Agreement and collect the Company Termination Fee (or enforce the Expense
Reimbursement Obligation) or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable,
pursuant to Article 7; provided, however, that in no event will such Persons
be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief or any other remedies under this
Agreement or available at law or equity, on the one hand, and payment of any
monetary damages whatsoever or the payment of all or a portion of the Company
Termination Fee (and satisfaction of the Expense Reimbursement Obligation) or
the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on the other hand.

b.Notwithstanding anything herein (including Section 8.16(a)) or in the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Sponsor Guaranty to the contrary, it is hereby
acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be entitled to enforce or seek
to enforce specifically Parent's obligation to cause all or any portion of the
Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the Equity
Commitment Letter) or otherwise cause Parent to consummate the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement only if: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and
Section 6.2 (other than conditions which are to be satisfied by actions taken
at the Closing) have been (and continue to be) satisfied (or have been waived) the time when the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 1.1; (ii)
the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing upon the
funding of the Equity Financing; (iii) the Company has notified Parent in
writing that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing if the
Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are funded, and such notice has not
been revoked; and (iv) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the
Merger by the date the Merger should have occurred pursuant to Section 1.1.

Section 8.17 Company Disclosure Schedule. The parties agree that the
disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Schedule will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the
corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only
if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on its face. The mere inclusion of an item
in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty is not deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 8.18 No Limitation. It is the intention of the parties hereto that, to
the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect
cannot be given to both or all such provisions, the representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and closing conditions in this
Agreement will be construed to be cumulative and that each representation,
warranty, covenant, obligation, agreement and closing condition in this
Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect and nothing set
forth in any provision herein will in any way be deemed to limit the scope,
applicability or effect of any other provision hereof.

Section 8.19 Performance Guarantee. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt
and faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of the
covenants, obligations, agreements, terms, conditions and undertakings of
Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, including
any such covenants, obligations, agreements, terms, conditions and
undertakings that are required to be performed, discharged or complied with
following the Effective Time by the Surviving Corporation.

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Zephyr Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Zephyr Merger

Merger (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the "Merger

WHEREAS, in accordance with the Merger Agreement and this Agreement, each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than in respect of any shares of Company

(the "PPP Loan"); and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution hereof, the Company has deposited
with KeyBank, N.A. an amount in cash equal to the outstanding principal amount
of, and all accrued interest on, the PPP Loan as of the date hereof, which
funds will be held by the Lender in a segregated, non-interest bearing
account.

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the agreements contained herein
and the consummation of the transactions referred to above, the parties hereto

* * *



Section 1.3 Nontransferable; Expiration.

a.The PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights may not be sold, assigned, transferred,
pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in
whole or in part, directly or indirectly, other than transfers (i) by will or
intestacy, (ii) by instrument to an inter vivos or testamentary trust where
the PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights are to be passed to beneficiaries upon the
death of the trustee, (iii) pursuant to a court order (such as in connection
with divorce, bankruptcy or liquidation), (iv) by operation of law (including
a consolidation or merger), or in connection with the dissolution, liquidation
or termination of a corporation, limited liability company, partnership or
other entity which is the holder thereof, or (v) in the case of PPP Loan
Forgiveness Rights payable to a nominee, from a nominee to a beneficial owner
(and, if applicable, through an intermediary) or from such nominee to another
nominee for the same beneficial owner, in each case as permitted by The
Depository Trust Company ("DTC") (collectively, "Permitted Transfers"). Any
attempted sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, encumbrance or disposition of
PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights, in whole or in part, in violation of this Section
1.3, shall be void ab initio and of no effect.



b.To the extent the conditions to payment of the PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights
have not been satisfied as of December 31, 2022 (the "Expiration Date"), the
PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights shall expire on such date and shall thereafter be
of no force or effect (except solely as necessary to pay amounts payable
hereunder that arise on or prior to the Expiration Date).



Section 1.4 No Equity or Ownership Interest; No Certificates, Voting,
Dividends or Interest. The PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights will not represent any
equity or ownership interest in the Company or any of its Affiliates, in any
constituent company to the Merger, or in any other Person and will not be
represented by any certificates or other instruments. The PPP Loan Forgiveness
Rights will not have any voting or dividend rights, and no interest shall
accrue on any amounts payable on the PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights to any
Holder.

Section 1.5 Registration; Registration of Transfer; Change of Address.

a.The Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Rights Agent the
name, address, Tax Identification Number, and number of PPP Loan Forgiveness
Rights of each Holder within five (5) Business Days of the Closing. The Rights
Agent shall keep a register (the "Register") for the registration of PPP Loan
Forgiveness Rights in a book-entry position for each Holder. The Register
shall set forth the name, address, and number of PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights
of each Holder. The Rights Agent is hereby initially appointed "Registrar" for
purposes of registering PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights and Permitted Transfers of
PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights as herein provided; provided that any successor
Rights Agent appointed pursuant to Section 2.2 shall automatically be deemed
to be the successor Registrar.

b.Subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 1.3, every request made to
transfer a PPP Loan Forgiveness Right must be in writing and accompanied by a
written instrument or instruments of transfer and any other requested
documentation in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the
Registrar, duly executed by the registered Holder thereof, the Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing, the Holder's personal representative, or
the Holder's survivor, and setting forth in reasonable detail the
circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Registrar shall, subject to its reasonable determination that the
transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer otherwise complies with
the other terms and conditions herein, register the transfer of the PPP Loan
Forgiveness Rights in the Register. The Company and the Rights Agent may
require payment from the transferor of a sum sufficient to cover any Tax that
is imposed in connection with any such registration of transfer. Neither the
Rights Agent nor the Registrar shall have any duty or obligation to take any
action under any section of this Agreement that requires the payment by a
Holder of applicable Taxes unless and until the Rights Agent and Registrar are
satisfied that all such Taxes have been paid. All duly transferred PPP Loan
Forgiveness Rights registered in the Register shall be the valid obligations
of the Company and shall entitle the transferee to the same benefits and
rights under this Agreement as those held immediately prior to the transfer by
the transferor. No transfer of a PPP Loan Forgiveness Right shall be valid
until registered in the Register, and any transfer not duly registered in the
Register will be void ab initio.

c.A Holder may make a written request to the Registrar to change such Holder's
address of record in the Register. The written request must be duly executed
by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Registrar shall
promptly record the change of address in the Register. The Rights Agent shall
provide a copy of the Register to the Company upon request.

Section 1.6 Ability to Abandon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, a Holder may at any time, at such Holder's option, abandon
all of such Holder's remaining rights in a PPP Loan Forgiveness Right by
written notice to the Rights Agent and the Company.

Section 1.7 Payments.

a.Payment of the PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights is subject to the receipt by the
Company on or prior to the Expiration Date of (i) written confirmation from
the U.S. Small Business Administration that the U.S. Small Business
Administration's audit of the PPP Loan has been satisfactorily completed and
(ii) written confirmation from the U.S. Small Business Administration and
KeyBank, N.A. of forgiveness of all, or a portion, of the amounts outstanding
under the PPP Loan. No later than three (3) Business Days after the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence, the Company shall deliver to the Rights Agent (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) an aggregate amount equal to (x) the amount of
the PPP Loan that is being (or has been) forgiven, minus (y) the sum of (A)
the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company and
its Affiliates following the Closing in applying for forgiveness of the PPP
Loan, plus (B) the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the
Company and its Affiliates in connection with any audit of the PPP Loan, plus
(C) the fees and expenses of the Rights Agent (such aggregate amount, the
"Additional Merger Consideration"). No later than five (5) Business Days after
receipt of the Additional Merger Consideration from the Company, the Rights
Agent shall pay to each Holder, an amount equal to (i) the Additional Merger
Consideration divided by (ii) the total number of PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights
outstanding as reflected on the Register at the time of such payment,
multiplied by (iii) the number of PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights held by such
Holder. Each such payment shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent and shall
be made by delivery of a check in the required amount mailed to the address of
each Holder as reflected in the Register on the date such checks are mailed.

b.The Company's obligation to pay amounts to the Rights Agent hereunder, and
the Rights Agent's obligation to pay the applicable amount to the Holders,
shall be conditioned on no court or other Governmental Entity having enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered
any order that is in effect and restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits or
imposes any penalty upon such payment, and the payment otherwise being lawful.

c.Any funds that remain undistributed to the Holders as of June 30, 2023
(whether as the result of any check not having been cashed, the inability of
the Rights Agent to deliver any check to any Holder, or for any other reason)
shall be delivered to the Company by the Rights Agent, and upon demand, any
Holder who has not theretofore received cash in exchange for such Holder's PPP
Loan Forgiveness Rights shall thereafter look only to the Company for payment
of such Holder's claim therefor. No interest shall be paid with respect to any
amount payable to any Holder. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, any portion of the Additional Merger Consideration that remains
unclaimed immediately prior to such time as such funds would otherwise escheat
to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Company free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto, subject
to any escheatment Laws.

d.The Rights Agent shall deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted or
withheld, from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law;
provided, however, that in determining the required amount to be withheld, the
Rights Agent will give effect to any properly presented form (e.g., Form W-8
or W-9 as applicable) eliminating or reducing the amount required to be
withheld. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or
deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

e.Following the Closing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain forgiveness of the PPP Loan and cooperate with the U.S.
Small Business Administration's audit of the PPP Loan and to otherwise satisfy
the conditions in Section 1.7(a) prior to the Expiration Date. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to timely comply with all deadlines, requests,
inquiries and similar items with respect to any such audit or application for
forgiveness of the PPP Loan.

a.This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to laws that may be applicable
under conflicts of laws principles.

b.Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware
State court, or Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any Action arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection
herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition
or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any
such Action except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of
any such Action shall be heard and determined in such Delaware State court or,
to the extent permitted by Law, in such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Action in any
such Delaware State or Federal court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such Action in any such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 3.1. Nothing
in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to
serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

c.EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE

invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 3.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar
attachment to email (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"), will be
treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and
will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party may raise the
use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent
such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

Section 3.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Merger Agreement, all
documents and instruments referenced herein and therein, and all exhibits and
schedules attached to the foregoing, constitute the entire agreement of the
parties hereto with respect to the PPP Loan Forgiveness Rights and supersede
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the PPP Loan Forgiveness
Rights. If and to the extent that any provision of this Agreement is
inconsistent or conflicts with the Merger Agreement, this Agreement shall
govern and be controlling.
