NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agrees
as follows:





2 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

ARTICLE I 
THE OFFER

Section 1.1 The Offer.

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with ARTICLE VII, as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement but in no event more than ten (10) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement (subject to the Company having timely
provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant to Section
1.1(g) and Section 1.2(c)), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the
Offer to purchase all of the outstanding Shares (the "Offer Commencement
Date"), at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price, net to the seller in
cash, without interest and subject to any withholding of Tax in accordance
with Section 2.7.

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of Merger Sub to (and
of Parent to cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares
validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under
applicable Laws) of the conditions set forth in Annex I (collectively, the
"Offer Conditions"). The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase
(the "Offer to Purchase") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement,
the Minimum Tender Condition, the Termination Condition and the other Offer
Conditions. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to (but is not obligated
to) at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion (i) increase the
amount of cash constituting the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition
(to the extent permitted under applicable Laws) and (iii) make any other
changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement; provided, however, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B)
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer (provided that nothing
herein shall limit the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to increase the cash
consideration payable in the Offer), (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares
sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions or requirements to
the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend, modify or waive the
Minimum Tender Condition or Termination Condition, (F) otherwise amend or
modify any of the other terms of the Offer in a manner that adversely affects
any holder of Shares in its capacity as such, or (G) terminate the Offer or
accelerate, extend or otherwise change the Expiration Time, in each case,
except as provided in Section 1.1(c), 1.1(d) or 1.1(e). The Offer may not be
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Time (or any rescheduled Expiration Time) of
the Offer, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with ARTICLE VII.





3 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

(c) Expiration of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire
at one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the date that is twenty (20)
business days (determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a)
under the Exchange Act) following the Offer Commencement Date (unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the "Initial
Expiration Time", and such time or such subsequent time to which the Initial
Expiration Time of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the "Expiration Time").

(d) Extension of the Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, but subject to the Parties\' respective termination rights
under ARTICLE VII: (i) if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration Time, any Offer
Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived by Merger Sub or Parent, to
the extent waivable by Merger Sub or Parent, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for additional periods of up to
ten (10) Business Days per extension (or such longer or shorter period as the
parties hereto may agree), to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; and
(ii) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer
from time to time for any period required by any Law applicable to the Offer;
provided, however, that in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), in no
event shall Merger Sub (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond the earlier
to occur of (x) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with ARTICLE
VII and (y) April 6, 2018 (the "Extension Deadline"); (2) be required to
extend the Offer for one or more additional periods not to exceed twenty (20)
Business Days in the aggregate if the Minimum Tender Condition is not
satisfied but all other Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived; or (3) be
permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior
written consent of the Company (provided, that if, on the Extension Deadline,
the sole then-unsatisfied Offer Condition is the condition set forth in
section (j) of Annex I (other than any conditions that by their express terms
will not be satisfied until the Offer Acceptance Time but which conditions are
capable of being satisfied at the start of and throughout such period), then
Merger Sub shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to extend the Offer
until the first Business Day following the end of the Marketing Period, so
long as no such extension would result in the Offer being extended beyond the
third (3rd) Business Day immediately preceding the Termination Date).

(e) Termination of Offer. Nothing in this Section 1.1 shall be deemed to
impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub to terminate this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VII. In
the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to ARTICLE VII, Merger
Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly, irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Shares pursuant
to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall promptly return,
and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in
accordance with applicable Laws, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.





4 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

(f) Acceptance. Subject only to the terms of this Agreement and the
satisfaction or, to the extent waivable by Merger Sub or Parent, waiver by
Merger Sub or Parent of each of the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) (i) promptly after (and in any event, no
later than the first Business Day after) the Expiration Time irrevocably
accept for payment all Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn)
pursuant to the Offer (the time of such acceptance, the "Offer Acceptance
Time") and (ii) as promptly as practicable after the Offer Acceptance Time
(and in any event within three (3) Business Days) pay for such Shares. Prior
to the Offer Acceptance Time, Merger Sub shall appoint a depository agent and
paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent") for the
payment of the aggregate Offer Price and the Merger Consideration to which the
Company's shareholders shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(i).
Promptly after (and in any event no later than the third Business Day after)
the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent, cash sufficient to make the payment of the
aggregate Offer Price payable pursuant to this section (together with the
amount deposited pursuant to Section 2.2(i), the "Payment Fund"). The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to pay the aggregate Offer
Price in the Offer and the aggregate Merger Consideration in the Merger.

(g) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement
Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer
statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents") that will
contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase, form of the related
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, (ii) make all deliveries,
mailings and telephonic notices required by Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act
and (iii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated
to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Laws. Parent
and Merger Sub agree that they shall cause the Offer Documents filed by either
Parent or Merger Sub with the SEC to (x) comply in all material respects with
the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws and (y) on the date first filed
with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the holders of
Shares, not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; provided, however, that no covenant or representation is
made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer
Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to respond
promptly to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff and
to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information is or shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Sub further
agree to take all steps necessary to promptly cause the Offer Documents as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC





5 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Laws. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of
the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The Company shall
promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Merger Sub or
Parent\'s legal counsel all information concerning the Company and the
Company\'s shareholders that may be required or reasonably requested in
connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(g). Prior to any
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents (including
any response to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff
with respect thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent and
Merger Sub shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments made by
the Company or its counsel. Prior to any Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent
and Merger Sub agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments
(including oral comments) Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt of those comments (including oral comments).

(h) Funds. Without limiting the generality of Section 5.16, Parent shall cause
to be provided to Merger Sub, on a timely basis, all of the funds necessary to
purchase all Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to
the Offer, and shall cause Merger Sub to perform, on a timely basis, all of
Merger Sub\'s obligations under this Agreement.

(i) Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not limit the Company's obligations under Section 5.1.

(j) Repayment of Specified Debt. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall have received and shall deliver (A)
to Parent Payoff Letters (or other evidence in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent) with respect to any Specified Debt contemplated to be
repaid (which shall be at the option of Parent in the event such Specified
Debt is not required to be repaid in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby) which shall provide for the payoff, discharge and
termination of such Specified Debt and the satisfaction of all obligations and
liabilities thereunder upon receipt of the amounts set forth therein and (B)
releases in customary forms concurrently with the repayment of obligations
giving rise thereto of all Liens with respect to the equity interests,
property and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to such
Specified Debt. At or immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, and
subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, (a)
Parent or Merger Sub shall make available to the Company, or pay directly, an





6 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

amount sufficient to pay all amounts owing with respect to such Specified Debt
outstanding as of the Offer Acceptance Time, as set forth in the applicable
Payoff Letter, (b) the Company, if such amount is not paid directly by Parent
or Merger Sub, shall apply such cash provided by Parent or Merger Sub to pay
all amounts owing with respect to such Specified Debt outstanding as of the
Offer Acceptance Time and (c) the Company shall cause itself and each of its
Subsidiaries to be fully and irrevocably released from all obligations,
liabilities and Liens relating to the Specified Debt outstanding as of the
Offer Acceptance Time as provided in the Payoff Letters.

(k) Guaranteed Delivery. For purposes of this Agreement and the Offer, unless
mutually agreed by Parent and the Company in writing, any Shares subject to
notices of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly tendered into
the Offer unless and until the Shares underlying such notices of guaranteed
delivery are delivered to Merger Sub or to an agent of Merger Sub.

Section 1.2 Company Actions.

(a) Approval. The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the
purchase of shares of Company common stock pursuant to the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.





7 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

(b) Schedule 14D-9. As soon as practicable following the filing of the Offer
Documents, and in any event on the date the Offer Documents are filed with the
SEC, the Company shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that,
subject to Section 6.1(b), shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation and
include the fairness opinion of the Company\'s financial advisor referenced in
Section 3.25 and (ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9 and related documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable
Laws, including by setting the Shareholder List Date in consultation with
Parent. The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to (x)
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable
Laws and (y) on the date first filed with the SEC and on the date first
published, sent or given to the holders of Shares, not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided,
however, that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to information
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments (including oral
comments) of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such
information is or shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to
promptly cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and
to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish or
otherwise make available to the Company or the Company\'s legal counsel all
information concerning Parent or Merger Sub that may be required or reasonably
requested in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.2(b).
Except with respect to any amendments filed after an Adverse Recommendation
Change, Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any response to any comments
(including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto) prior
to the filing thereof with the SEC or dissemination of such documents to the
shareholders of the Company, and the Company shall give reasonable
consideration to any such comments made by Parent or its counsel. Prior to any
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall provide Parent and its
counsel with any comments (including oral comments) the Company or its counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
promptly after receipt of those comments (including oral comments).

(c) Shareholder Lists. The Company shall promptly after the date hereof (and
in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement) furnish Parent with a list of its shareholders, mailing labels and
any available listing or computer file containing





8 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of
securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case as of
the most recent practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional
information (including updated lists of shareholders, mailing labels and lists
of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably
request in connection with the Offer and the Merger (the date of the list used
to determine the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9
are first disseminated, which date shall not be more than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the date the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first
disseminated, the "Shareholder List Date"). Subject to applicable Laws, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and
Merger Sub and their agents shall hold in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files.

(d) Share Registry. The Company shall register (and shall instruct its
transfer agent to register) the transfer of the Shares accepted for payment by
Merger Sub effective immediately after the Offer Acceptance Time.

Section 1.3 Directors Prior to the Effective Time.

(a) Composition of Company Board and Board Committee. Effective upon the Offer
Acceptance Time and from time to time thereafter until the Effective Time (as
defined in Section 2.5 hereof), Parent shall be entitled to designate the
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board
that equals the product of: (i) the total number of directors on the Company
Board (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to
this Section 1.3); and (ii) the percentage that the number of Shares
beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub (including shares accepted for
payment) bears to the total number of Shares outstanding, and the Company
shall cause Parent\'s designees to be appointed to the Company Board. At such
time, the Company shall also cause individuals designated by Parent to
constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on: (A)
each committee of the Company Board; and (B) as requested by Parent, each
board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee

Section 1.4 Top-Up Option.

(a) Top-Up Option. In the event the Minimum Tender Condition is satisfied, the
Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up
Option"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Section 1.4, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price paid in
the Offer up to that number of newly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable
Shares (the "Top-Up Shares") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when
added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and Merger Sub at the time of
exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the
Shares outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares on a
fully diluted basis (which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative
securities regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting
schedule, or other terms and conditions thereof); provided, however, that: (i)
the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number of Shares in excess of
the Shares authorized and unissued at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option; (ii) the exercise of the Top-Up Option and the issuance and delivery
of the Top-Up Shares shall not be prohibited by any Law (other than any
listing requirement of any national securities exchange); and (iii) the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares shall not require approval of the Company\'s
shareholders under applicable Law (excluding the rules of NASDAQ). The Top-Up
Option shall be exercisable only once, in whole but not in part, at any time
following the Offer Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to occur of: (A)
the Effective Time; and (B) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms.

(b) Top-Up Notice; Top-Up Option Closing. In the event Merger Sub wishes to
exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company written notice
concurrently with the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to Section
1.1(f), specifying the number of Shares owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries
at the time of such notice (giving effect to the Shares purchased in the
Offer), and a place and a time for the closing of such purchase. The Company
shall, promptly following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice
confirming the number of Top-Up Shares to be purchased by Merger Sub. Upon
Merger Sub's written request, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to Parent the number
of shares of Company common stock issued and outstanding as of immediately
prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option. At the closing of the purchase of
Top-Up Shares (which shall be on the same date as the date of the Offer
Acceptance Time), the aggregate purchase price owed by Merger Sub to the
Company for the Top-Up Shares shall be paid to the Company at Parent\'s
election, either: (i) entirely in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds; or
(ii) by (A) paying in cash by wire transfer of same-day funds an amount equal
to not less than the greater of (x) the aggregate par value of the Top-Up
Shares, or (y) the product of $0.10 per share times the number of Top-Up
Shares, and (B) Parent and Merger Sub issuing to the Company a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase price pursuant to
the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding
clause (A) (the





11 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

"Promissory Note"). The Promissory Note: (1) shall bear simple interest at a
rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as published by The Wall Street
Journal on the date of execution and delivery of the Promissory Note); (2)
shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution of the
Promissory Note; (3) shall be full recourse to Parent and Merger Sub; (4) may
be prepaid, at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty; and
(5) shall have no other material terms. The Company shall cause to be issued
to Merger Sub a Certificate representing the Top-Up Shares or, if the Company
does not then have certificated Shares, the applicable number of Book-Entry
Shares. Such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any legends that
are required by federal and state securities Laws.

(c) Exemption from Registration. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that no
Top-Up Shares issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will be registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act") and that all such shares will be
issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the
Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants
to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be, upon the purchase of the Top-
Up Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 401 of Regulation D
under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the
Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and
will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the Securities Act).

Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease
to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto and each holder of

arrangement or agreement of the Company (such plans, arrangements or
agreements, collectively, the "Company Stock Plans") (including restricted
stock (including any awards with performance-based vesting conditions) and
dividend equivalents) (each right or award, including each Phantom Award, a
"Company Stock-Based Award"), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right or
award with respect to the Shares, shall become fully vested (and any
performance-based vesting conditions shall be deemed to have been achieved at
the target level of performance) and shall entitle the holder thereof to
receive, at the Effective Time, an amount in cash, subject to any withholding
of Tax in accordance with Section 2.7, equal to the Merger Consideration in
respect of each Share underlying a particular Company Stock-Based Award. For
the avoidance of doubt, this Section 2.3(a) shall not apply to any common
stock purchased pursuant to the ESPP (as defined below) which shall be covered
by Section 2.2 as issued and outstanding Shares.

(b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, take all

administratively feasible following the Effective Time, without interest.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions and
take such actions (including delivering all required notices, obtaining any

to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.3. At or prior to the Effective

permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the

Articles of Merger have been duly filed with the each secretary of state or at
such other date or time as permitted by the Oregon Act and the DGCL as Parent
and the Company shall agree in writing and shall specify in the Articles of
Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").





14 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

Section 2.6 Surrender of Shares and Payment.

(a) On or before the Effective Time on the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit
(or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient
to make all payments pursuant to Section 2.2(i) (the "Payment Fund"). The
Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the
Surviving Corporation, provided that (i) no such investment or losses thereon
shall relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation from making the payments
required by this Article II or affect the amount of Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of the common stock, and following any losses, Parent
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent to add to the
Payment Fund for the benefit of the Company's shareholders immediately prior
to the Effective Time in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such
investments shall be in short term obligations of the United States with
maturities of no more than 30 days and guaranteed by the United States and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States or in commercial
paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moody's Investors Services,
Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively. Any interest or other
income resulting from such investments shall be payable to the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not
later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
(i) an outstanding certificate or certificates ("Certificates") that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares or (ii)
uncertificated shares of common stock represented by book-entry immediately
prior to the Effective Time ("Book-Entry Shares"), (A) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the customary procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal)
and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates
or Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with
respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.2(i). Upon surrender of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as
the Paying Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.
In the event that the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, that the signatures on such
Certificate or any related stock power shall be properly guaranteed and that
the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of such payment to a





15 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been paid
or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.6(b), each Share represented by a Certificate and each Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender or transfer the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of each Share theretofore represented by such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.2(i), without any
interest thereon.

(c) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of common stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of common stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II, subject to delivery of all documents required hereunder.

(d) At any time following the date that is twelve months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it (or any designee thereof) any Payment Funds (including any
interest received with respect thereto) that have been made available to the
Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to
Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Merger Consideration, without any interest, payable upon due surrender of
their Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its
designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective affiliates
will be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for Merger
Consideration delivered to any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law.

(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
holder's compliance with the reasonable replacement requirements established
by the Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by such Person of a
bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with





16 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.7 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
Merger Sub and the Paying Agent and their agents shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of common
stock, Company Stock-Based Awards or any other payments pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any corresponding provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and timely remitted to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be.

Section 2.8 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in this Agreement and in the relevant provisions of the Oregon Act and the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties
of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.9 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws.

(a) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Company shall
be amended and restated to read the same as the articles of incorporation of
Merger Sub on the date hereof, except such articles of incorporation shall be
amended to reflect that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be Key
Technology, Inc., and, as so amended and restated, shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the "Surviving Corporation
Articles") until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof
and as provided by applicable Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof, the
Surviving Corporation Articles and applicable Law, except that such bylaws
shall be amended to reflect that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall
be Key Technology, Inc.





17 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

Effective Time shall from and after the Effective Time be the officers of the

2015 and prior to the date hereof, collectively, the "Company SEC Documents").
As of their respective filing or effective dates, or, if amended, as of the
date of the last such amendment, each of the Company SEC Documents complied,
and each such Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the date hereof and
prior to the Closing Date will comply, as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, each as in

effect on the date so filed or effective. As of their respective filing dates
(or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date hereof,
as of the date of such amendment or superseding filing), none of the Company
SEC Documents contained, and no such Company SEC Document filed subsequent to
the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date will contain, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they

Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment became
effective, did not, and each such Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the
date hereof and prior to the Closing Date will not, contain any untrue

relating to the Company SEC Documents, together with all written responses of
the Company thereto. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in any

the Company SEC Documents, the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of the Company have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, and
(i) the statements contained in any such certifications were complete and
correct and (ii) such certification complied with the applicable provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in each case in all material respects as of their
respective dates. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has not
received written notice from the SEC challenging or questioning the accuracy,
completeness, form or manner of filing of such certifications made with
respect to the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this
Agreement.

(c) The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company (including
any related notes thereto) included in the Company SEC Documents have been
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its Subsidiaries at the date thereof and the results of their operations
and cash flows for the periods indicated, all in accordance with GAAP. The
unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company (including any
related notes thereto) included in the Company SEC Documents have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or may be
permitted by the





23 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

SEC under the Exchange Act) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and the results of their operations and cash flows
for the periods indicated (subject to normal period-end adjustments which if
included would not be material individually or in the aggregate), all in
accordance with GAAP.

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a, 15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to
ensure that all information relating to the Company, including its
Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of the Company by others within those
entities to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make
the certifications of the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports. The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act)
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures
that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company's
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's
system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2016, and, except as set forth in the Company SEC
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, that assessment concluded
that those controls were effective. The Company has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of
the Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Company's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal control over
financial reporting. There were no significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses identified in management's assessment of internal controls as of
and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017 (nor
has any such deficiency or weakness been identified since such dates).

Section 3.7 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, except for liabilities and obligations (a)
specifically reflected and adequately reserved against in the audited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of September 30, 2017 that is
included in the Company SEC Documents as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Company Balance Sheet"), or disclosed in the notes thereto, (b) incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the date
of the Company Balance Sheet in amounts that would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (c) incurred pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-

relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any Subsidiary of the Company, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the

liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the Company's
consolidated financial statements or any Company SEC Documents.

that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. There has not been any action taken by the Company or any of

of this Agreement that, if taken during the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Closing Date without the consent of Parent, would
constitute a breach of Section 5.1 hereof.

Section 3.9 Absence of Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, (a) there
is no material Action pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened

written threats thereof.

Section 3.10 Compliance with Laws. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
are, and have been since October 1, 2015, in material compliance with all Laws
applicable to them or by which any of their respective properties are bound.
Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has received any
written notice since October 1, 2015 that remains unresolved (i) of any
proceeding by any Governmental Entity relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) from any Governmental Entity alleging that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries are not in compliance with any Applicable Law in any
material respect, which in either case, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries have in effect all permits, licenses, exemptions,
authorizations, franchises, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities
(collectively, "Permits") necessary for them to own, lease or operate their
properties and to carry on their businesses as now conducted in all material
respects. To the Company's Knowledge, no event has occurred that, with or
without notice or lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
result in any right of termination, material amendment, cancellation,

have occurred no material defaults (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) under or, material violations of, Permits.

of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of the most recent such
letter that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualified

Section 4.5 Absence of Litigation. There is no Action by or against Parent or
Merger Sub pending, or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing that

contemplated hereby. The vote or consent of Parent as the sole shareholder of
Merger Sub, which vote or consent has been given or delivered to Merger Sub
prior to Merger Sub's entry into this Agreement, and which shall be in effect
at all times through the Effective Time, is the only vote or consent of the
holders of any class or series of capital stock or other Equity Interests of
Merger Sub necessary to approve this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.3 No Solicitation.

(a) Except as set forth in Section 5.3(b) through (e), prior to the Offer

complied with) shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3(a). On
the date hereof, the Company will immediately cease and terminate any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations by the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and direct its Representatives to cease and terminate, all such activities,
discussions and negotiations with any Persons with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and terminate access by any Person to any physical or electronic data
room relating to any potential Acquisition Proposal. Within three Business
Days of the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall request the prompt
return or destruction of any confidential information provided to any Person
within the twelve months immediately preceding the date of this Agreement in
connection with a potential Acquisition Proposal or similar transaction. It is
agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3 by
any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall constitute
a breach of this Section 5.3.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.3(a), if on or after
the date hereof, the Company or its Representatives receive a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal (not resulting from a material breach of this
Section 5.3) from a Person that the Company Board reasonably determines (after
consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company
and its Representatives may, subject to compliance with this Section 5.3, (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that the Company will not, and will
not permit its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives to, furnish any
information or enter into, maintain or participate in any such discussions or
negotiations except pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement on terms
no less restrictive than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (a
copy of which will be promptly provided to Parent); provided, further, that
any such information so furnished has been previously provided to Parent or is





52 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

provided to Parent promptly (and in any event no later twenty-four (24) hours)
after it is so furnished to such Person.

(c) In the event that the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or request for information that could reasonably be expected
to lead to, or result in, an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall (i)
as soon as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of
receipt, advise Parent of the material terms and conditions (including the
identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal) and keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status and material developments affecting the
terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any
discussions and negotiations concerning such terms and conditions) on a
current basis, and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt or delivery thereof) (x) any
written indication of interest or other material that constitutes a proposal
(or amendment thereto) including copies of any proposed definitive agreements
with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal and any financing commitments
related thereto and (y) in the case of any oral proposal, a written summary of
such oral proposal.

(d) Except as set forth in Section 5.3(e) and Section 5.3(f), neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend or declare advisable any Acquisition
Proposal (it being understood that failing to recommend the rejection of any
Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer within ten
Business Days after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer
shall be considered an adverse modification), (iii) after public announcement
of an Acquisition Proposal (other than in connection with the commencement of
a tender offer or exchange offer), fail to publicly re-affirm the Company
Board Recommendation within three (3) Business Days after a written request by
Parent to do so (or, if earlier, by the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the scheduled date of the consummation or expiration of
the Offer), (iv) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Schedule 14D-9 when disseminated to the Company's shareholders or (v) publicly
propose to take any such actions (any of such actions, an "Adverse
Recommendation Change").

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.3(d), if, due to an
Intervening Event, the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company Board
may make an Adverse Recommendation Change of the type described in clause (i)
or (iv) of Section 5.3(d); provided, however, that the Company has first
complied with the following provisions, and, after so complying, the Company
Board or any committee thereof determines that such Intervening Event
continues to necessitate an Adverse





53 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

Recommendation Change. The Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall not
take any action set forth in this Section 5.3(e) unless the Company Board has
first:

(i) provided written notice to Parent of its intention to take such action at
least four Business Days in advance of taking such action, which notice shall
provide reasonable detail regarding such Intervening Event; and

(ii) negotiated, and caused the Company and its Representatives to negotiate,
in good faith during the four Business Day period following Parent's receipt
of the notice of the Intervening Event (the "Intervening Event Notice
Period"), or if at the time received by the Company there are less than three
Business Days before a Company shareholders meeting or the Offer Expiration
Time, as much notice as reasonably practicable, with Parent to enable Parent
to propose to amend the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal, and

(iii) after complying with the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), determined in
good faith (after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and
financial advisors), in light of any proposed amendment to the terms of this
Agreement or other proposals during the Intervening Event Notice Period, that
such Intervening Event continues to necessitate an Adverse Recommendation
Change and that the failure to make the Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.3(d), if the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal, with respect to which no material breach of
Section 5.3 has occurred, and that the Company Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and
its financial advisors) constitutes a Superior Proposal, and that failure to
do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
the Company may either (i) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(i) to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, or (ii) make an Adverse Recommendation Change; provided, however,
that in the case of either (i) or (ii), the Company has first complied with
the following provisions, and, after so complying, the Company Board or any
committee thereof determines that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws; provided, further, that the Company shall not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) unless the Company has (y) complied
with its obligations under this Section 5.3(f), and (z) pays or causes to be
paid to Parent the Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 7.3(b) prior to
or concurrently with such termination. The Company Board (or any committee
thereof) shall not take any action set forth in this Section 5.3(f) unless the
Company Board has first:





54 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

(i) provided written notice to Parent of its intention to take such action at
least four (4) Business Days in advance of taking such action (a "Notice of
Superior Proposal"), which notice shall advise Parent that the Company Board
has received an Acquisition Proposal and that the Company Board or any
committee thereof has determined that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal; and

(ii) negotiated, and caused the Company and its Representatives to negotiate,
in good faith during the four (4) Business Day period following Parent's
receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, as applicable, or if at the time
received by the Company there are less than three Business Days before a
Company shareholders meeting or the Offer Expiration Time, as much notice as
reasonably practicable, with Parent to enable Parent to make a counteroffer or
propose to amend the terms of this Agreement, and

(iii) after complying with the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), determined in
good faith (after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and
financial advisors), in light of any counteroffer or proposed amendment to the
terms of this Agreement during the Notice Period, that the Superior Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make the
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

For the avoidance of doubt, any (1) material revisions to the terms of a
Superior Proposal or (2) material revisions to an Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board had determined no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal,
shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal and shall in each case require the
Company to deliver to Parent a new Notice of Superior Proposal, except that
the references to four (4) Business Days in this Section 5.3(f) shall be
deemed to be two (2) Business Days.

(g) Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
shareholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer), from (ii) making any required disclosure to the Company's
shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure to disclose such information would
reasonably be expected to violate its disclosure obligations under applicable
Law, or (iii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to its
shareholders pursuant to Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to shareholders), in each case, in which the
Company indicates that it has not made an Adverse Recommendation Change.





55 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

Section 5.4 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i)

Law, to their respective Representatives, offices, other facilities, books,
records and reports and other documents and information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries in their possession, and (ii) furnish Parent and
Merger Sub with all financial, operating and other data and information as
Parent and Merger Sub shall reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) any such investigation or consultation shall be conducted at Parent\'s
expense under the supervision of the Company and in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, and each shall
cause its Representatives not to, contact any of the employees, customers,
distributors, or suppliers of the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement whether in person or by telephone, mail or
other means of communication without the prior written authorization of the
Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided,
that no dissemination of the Offer Documents to holders of Shares or filing of
the Offer Documents with the SEC shall be deemed to require the Company's
authorization pursuant to this Section 5.4(a)(ii). Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would be reasonably expected to,
in the reasonable judgment of the Company (after consultation with outside
counsel), (i) breach any agreement with any third-party entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement, (ii) constitute a waiver of or jeopardize the
attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company, or (iii) otherwise
violate any applicable Law, including the Antitrust Laws; provided, however,
that in each case the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it
is withholding such information or documents and thereafter the Company and
Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected
to violate such restriction or waive the applicable privilege or protection.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and shall cause its
Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub
pursuant to or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted
(or threatened to be instituted) against a party to this Agreement by a
Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Offer, the Merger, the

57 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

(i) liaising with each other in relation to each step of the procedure before
the relevant Governmental Entities and as to the contents of all
communications with such Governmental Entities relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby. To the extent permitted by Law or Governmental Entity,

provide the other with a copy of the non-confidential portions of such
notification or filing in draft form and discuss its content before it is

Parent, as sole shareholder of Merger Sub, shall adopt this Agreement and

Section 5.7 Employment and Employee Benefits Matters; Other Plans.

(a) Subject to applicable Law and without limiting any additional rights that
any current or former Company Employee may have under any Company Plan or
applicable collective bargaining or labor agreement, effective as of the
Effective Time , Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or another
Subsidiary or Affiliate of Parent to provide each employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries who continues employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of Parent's other Subsidiaries or Affiliates following the
Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee"), until (A) December 31, 2018,
(1) the same level of base salary and hourly wages as in effect for such
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the





58 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

Effective Time and (2) benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable
than the benefits (excluding equity and equity-based compensation, defined
benefit pension, cash incentive compensation and any retention, severance or
change in control plans, policies, practices or arrangements) provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee as of the Effective
Time and (B) September 30, 2018, the same annual cash bonus opportunity
provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent intends that each Continuing Employee who continues employment
with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of Parent's other Subsidiaries
or Affiliates following September 30, 2018 shall be eligible to earn a cash
bonus for the period commencing on October 1, 2018 and ending on December 31,
2018 (the "2018 Stub Period") (x) on substantially similar terms and
conditions to the terms and conditions of the annual cash bonus plan such
Continuing Employee was eligible to participate in as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (y) with a target cash bonus opportunity equal to 25%
of the annual target cash bonus opportunity provided to such Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each of (x) and
(y), as may be adjusted by Parent in its good faith discretion for the 2018
Stub Period. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries from amending or
terminating any Company Plan or other employee benefit plan or program at any
time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

(b) As of and after the Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, Parent and
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) will
give Continuing Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting
(and, solely with respect to severance, vacation, sick leave and similar paid
time-off plans, programs, polices and arrangements (but, for the avoidance of
doubt, not any defined benefit pension plan or plan providing post-retirement
pension or retiree welfare arrangements), benefit level) under all benefit
plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of
Continuing Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) (each, a
"Parent Plan") for the Continuing Employees' service with the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities to the same extent recognized by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided that the foregoing shall not apply (x) to the extent that its
application would result in the duplication of benefits or (y) for purposes of
any Parent Plan (A) under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (B) that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation. If the Effective Time occurs prior to June 29, 2018 with
respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) and in which the Continuing Employees participate as of
immediately following the Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, Parent
and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation)
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause there to be waived any
preexisting condition, waiting period and





59 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

eligibility limitations, to the extent waived, satisfied, not applicable or
not included under the corresponding Company Plan, the same was waived or did
not apply under Company Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out of pocket
limitations for the plan year of such Parent Plan in which the Effective Time
occurs, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to,
Continuing Employees under the corresponding Company Plan during the plan year
of such Company Plan in which the Effective Time occurs.

(c) The Company and Parent shall, and shall procure that each of their
respective Affiliates shall, notify and/or consult with Employee
Representative Bodies in relation to the matters contemplated by this
Agreement to the extent that they are required to under applicable Law, any
relevant collective bargaining agreement or agreement with any Employee
Representative Bodies. The Company and Parent shall, and shall procure that
each of their respective Affiliates shall, provide such information and such
assistance as may reasonably be required by the other party in connection with
their obligations under this Section 5.7(c). The Company shall periodically
inform Parent of the status of any negotiations with each respective Employee
Representative Body as well as the contents of any agreement or binding
statement with each respective Employee Representative Body and shall not
enter into any agreements with or issue any binding statements to any Employee
Representative Body that will result in any liability to, or obligation for,
Parent or its Affiliates without Parent's prior written approval, whereas it
is understood that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be construed as an
amendment of an existing employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its
Affiliates. No current or former Company Employee or Continuing Employee (or
any of their dependents or beneficiaries) shall have status as a third party
beneficiary with respect to enforcing a claim hereunder, and it is expressly
acknowledged that the continued employment of each employee of the Company is
"at will" and may be terminated by Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, or such employees, at any time and for any or no
reason.

(e) The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any written communications
intended for distribution to any current or former Company Employees if such
communications relate to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and will provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such communications prior to
distribution.

Section 5.8 Takeover Laws. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or similar takeover Law (collectively, "Takeover Laws") is or
purports to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, the Company and its board of directors
shall take all action necessary (and Parent and its board





60 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

of directors shall cooperate with the Company, and shall provide such
assistance as the Company may reasonably request, in connection with such
action) to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such
Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 5.9 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company (on behalf of itself
and its Subsidiaries) and Parent (on behalf of itself and Merger Sub) shall
promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received
by such party or its Representatives from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
if the subject matter of such communication could be material to the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the prompt consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any Action commenced or, to such
party's knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relates to or is
reasonably expected to affect the prompt consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby, (c) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, has caused or would be reasonably
likely to cause or result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in
ARTICLE VI not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being
materially delayed, (d) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, change,
development, circumstance, occurrence, state of facts or effect, individually
or in the aggregate, that has caused or is reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement of such party to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or (e) any material failure of
the Company, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be, or any officer,
director, employee, agent or Representative of the Company, Merger Sub or
Parent, as applicable, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
provided, however, that failure to give prompt notice pursuant to this Section
5.9 shall not constitute a failure of a condition to the Merger set forth in
ARTICLE VI except to the extent that the underlying fact or circumstance not
so notified would, standing alone, constitute such a failure; provided,
further that that no notification given by any party pursuant to this Section
5.9 shall (A) limit or otherwise affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions contained in this Agreement,
(B) otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies contained in this
Agreement, (C) be deemed to affect or modify such party's reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the other
parties in this Agreement or (D) be deemed to amend or supplement the Company
Disclosure Letter or prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of warranty
or breach of covenant by such party.

Section 5.10 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.





61 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

(a) From and after the Offer Acceptance Time, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of each present (as of the
Effective Time) and former officer, director or employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in the articles of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or in any indemnification agreement between such
Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries listed on Section
5.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case until the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any
such Indemnified Party for a period of six years after the Effective Time. For
the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 2.9,
during such six-year period, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving Corporation (or
any successor's) Articles and bylaws provisions regarding elimination of
liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees,
and advancement of expenses to officers, directors and employees that are at
least as favorable as those contained in the articles of incorporation or
bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during such six-year period, such
provisions shall not be repealed, amended or amended in any manner except as
required by applicable Law.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Existing Policies") or cause to be
provided substitute policies or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to
purchase a "tail policy," in either case on the same terms and conditions as
the Existing Policies from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings,
covering, without limitation, the Merger; provided, however, that after the
Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies annual premiums in excess of 300% of the current annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the
coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for payment of annual
premiums equal to 300% of current annual premiums; provided further, that if
the Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail policy" and the coverage
thereunder costs more than 300% of such current annual premium, the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained
for 300% of such current annual premium.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy





62 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Indemnified Party, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.10 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

(d) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.10 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

Section 5.11 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the
Company Board shall take such steps as it determines may be reasonably
necessary or advisable, and take all actions as may be reasonably requested by
any party hereto, to cause dispositions or cancellations of Common Equity
Interests of the Company (including shares of common stock and derivative
securities) held by each individual who is then subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company,
and who would otherwise be subject to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.12 Rule 14d-10 Matters. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time and to
the extent permitted by applicable Laws, the compensation committee of the
Company Board, will approve, as an "employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
under the Exchange Act, each agreement, arrangement or understanding between
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or their respective Affiliates and any of the
officers, directors or employees of the Company that are effective as of the
date of this Agreement or are entered into after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Offer Acceptance Time pursuant to which compensation is paid
to such officer, director or employee and will take all other action necessary
to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act. Promptly upon Parent or any of its
Affiliates entering into any such arrangement with any of the officers,
directors or employees of the Company, Parent will provide to the Company any
and all information concerning such arrangements as may be needed by the
Company to comply with this Section 5.12.

Section 5.13 Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration. Prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to enable the delisting by
the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from The NASDAQ Global Market and the





63 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time.

Section 5.14 Public Announcements. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any public announcement without the prior consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless after
consultation with outside legal counsel, is so required by applicable Law,
court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or national securities quotation system, provided
that in each such case, the party required to make such disclosure shall
provide notice to and use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the
other parties a reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance or public disclosure to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

Section 5.15 Shareholder Litigation. In the event that any shareholder or
derivative claim or Action related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including disclosures made under
securities laws and regulations related thereto) ("Transaction Action") is
filed, or, to the Knowledge of the Company threatened, against the Company or
the members of the Company Board prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent (and in any event within two (2) Business
Days after obtaining knowledge thereof) of any such Action or threat and shall
(i) give Parent the right to review and comment on all material filings or
responses to be made by the Company in connection with any Transaction Action
(and the Company shall in good faith take such comments into account), and the
opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of, any Transaction
Action and (ii) if Parent does not exercise such right to participate (subject
to the Company's control right), keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed
with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall reasonably consult with
Parent with respect to the defense or settlement of any such Transaction
Action, and no settlement thereof shall be agreed to without Parent's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

with the Financing as promptly as practicable and use its reasonable best
efforts to, and to cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
officers, employees and representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Financing; provided, however, that
nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would
materially and unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the
Company.

(b) The Company shall not be required to bear any cost or expense or to pay
any commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment (other than
reasonable out-of-pocket costs) or incur any other liability in connection
with the Financing prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless, the Company, and its respective officers, employees and
representatives, from and against any and all liabilities or losses suffered
or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and
any information utilized in connection therewith, other than (i) to the extent
resulting from materially false or misleading information provided by or on

Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with their

except (a) with respect to the final sentence of Section 1.2(c), Section 5.4,
this Section 7.2, Section 7.3, and ARTICLE VIII (other than Section 8.11) (and
any related definitions contained in any such Sections or Article), which

or damages incurred or suffered by a party, to the extent such liabilities or

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.3 and Section 5.6(b), all

(ii) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(i), or

(iii) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii),

then, in any such case, the Company shall pay Parent a termination fee in an

shall be deemed to be a reference to "fifty percent (50%)") and such
Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated or (B) any Acquisition
Proposal (the reference to "fifteen percent (15%)" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "fifty percent
(50%)") is consummated, then the Company shall pay Parent the Company

to the account or accounts designated by the Company within (2) Business Days
after such termination, it being understood that in no event shall Parent be
required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Solely
for purposes of establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and without in
any way increasing the amount of the Parent Termination Fee or expanding the
circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is to be paid, it is agreed
that the Parent Termination Fee is a liquidated damage, and not a penalty.

(e) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the other parties would not enter into this Agreement;

or the Company, as applicable, commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the other party for the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3, the
other party shall pay to the Company or Parent, as applicable, its

due pursuant to this Section 7.3 from the date such payment was required to be
made until the date of payment, at the prime lending rate as published in The

made.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, other than the
Company's right to seek specific performance prior to termination of the
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.11, in the event the Closing does not occur
(x) if the Company is entitled to receive the Parent Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 7.3(d), the Company's right to receive payment of an

directors, officers, employees, agents, Representatives, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners or assignees (collectively, "Company

result of the failure of the Offer, the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated hereunder to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder (whether intentionally, unintentionally, knowingly, willfully or
otherwise, including a Willful Breach) or otherwise, and (y) upon the
Company's receipt of the Parent Termination Fee and costs of collection
payable in accordance with Section 7.3(e), if any, none of the Parent Related

out of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated

judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and (c) that (i) the Action in any such court is brought in an

proceeding.

Section 8.8 Amendment or Supplement. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented by the parties hereto by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors at any time prior to the Effective Time. This
Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether

herein, no modification, waiver or termination of Sections 7.3(f), 8.5, 8.6,
8.7, 8.10, 8.11, 8.12, 8.13, 8.16 or this Section 8.8 (and any provision of
this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
provision would modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) that
is adverse to the interests of any Financing Source will be effective against
a Financing Source without the prior written consent of such adversely
affected Financing Source.

Section 8.9 Extension of Time; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, may, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of
directors, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other set forth in
this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) subject to
applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of
the other contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such waiver shall be valid only if expressly set forth in a written instrument
executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such party.
No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or





75 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

power. The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are
not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have
hereunder.

Section 8.10 Assignment; Successors. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void provided
that Parent or Merger Sub, upon prior written notice to the Company, may
assign, in its sole discretion (provided that such assignment shall not impede
or delay the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or otherwise impede the
rights of shareholders of the Company under this Agreement), (i) any of or all
its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any of its
respective Affiliates and (ii) any or all of rights (but not any of its
obligations hereunder) as collateral to any of its Financing Sources;
provided, further, that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub
of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 8.11 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy would occur and the parties hereto would not have an adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Accordingly, subject to the immediately following sentence, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall be
entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the courts
described in Section 8.7 without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement.
Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (x) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.11 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, under no circumstances shall any of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of
the consummation of the Merger pursuant to this Section 8.11 and the payment
of all or any portion of the Company Termination Fee.

Section 8.12 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under





76 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any applicable Law or rule in any jurisdiction, so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision
had never been contained herein. Upon such a determination, the parties agree
to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner,
in order that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 8.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (a) NO AGENT, ATTORNEY OR OTHER
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (b) EACH PARTY HERETO UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (c) EACH PARTY HERETO MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (d) EACH PARTY HERETO HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS Section 8.13.

Section 8.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, have delivered to the other. Signatures to this Agreement
transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in PDF form, or by
any other electronic means designed to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, will be deemed to have the same effect as
physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original signatures.





77 - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

Section 8.15 No Presumption Against Drafting Party. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this
Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is expressly
waived.

Section 8.16 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement may only be brought against, the Persons that are expressly named as
parties to this Agreement. Except to the extent named as a party to this
Agreement, and then only to the extent of the specific obligations of such
parties set forth in this Agreement, as the case may be, no Parent Related
Party, shall have any liability to the Company, any holder of Shares or any
other Person for any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements
or other obligations or liabilities of any of the parties to this Agreement or
for any claim based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement, or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, or in respect of any other document
or theory of law or in equity, or in respect of any written or oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
such documents or transactions, whether in contract, in tort, in equity or
otherwise.
