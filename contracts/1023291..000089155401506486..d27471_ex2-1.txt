prejudice  to EE Holdco\'s rights (whether under this Agreement generally
or  under this clause) to the extent that the Buyer shall not have  complied
with its obligations under this Agreement; or   (c) treat such failure or
inability to comply as a repudiatory breach  of this Agreement, acceptance of
which shall discharge EE Holdco  from its undischarged obligations under this
Agreement (without  prejudice to any other remedy which EE Holdco may have,
whether  in damages or otherwise).  5.4 The Guarantor shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable following  Completion, use its reasonable endeavours
to make available to the Buyer  any title deeds or documents relating to any
freehold or leasehold  property comprising part of the Business Assets which

Buyer in respect of its  obligations under 6.3(b) or (c)).  7 EE HOLDCO\'S

by reference to or inference from the terms  of any other Warranty or any
other term of this Agreement.  7.4 The Buyer warrants at the date of this
Agreement to EE Holdco:   (a) that it is not aware of any matter which
constitutes a breach of  the Warranties;    10     (b) in the same

references to the Buyer; and   (c) that there has been no material adverse
change in the financial  condition of the Buyer from that disclosed in its
audited  accounts for the year ending 31 December 2000.  7.5
INDEMNITY  7.5.1 EE Holdco shall (subject to clause 7.5.3) indemnify the
Buyer on  demand for any loss or expenses suffered or incurred by the Buyer
as  a result of EE having Disposed of, or Relinquished Operational  Control
over, any Asset in such a way which causes OFGEM at any time,  but not later
than the date falling six months after the finalisation  of the next
Distribution Price Control Review to reduce the  Regulatory Asset Value of EE
or to otherwise require of EE payment,  repayment or the giving of credit to
customers of (or of an amount  equal to) any proportion of any gain made on
such Disposal or  Relinquishment of Operational Control.  7.5.2 In this
clause 7.5:   "ASSETS" means the properties listed in Appendix 31 to the

Limited (the "MASTER Lease"), the Asset Usage Agreement  between EE and

referred to in or  ancillary to any thereof and any leases or licences
granted pursuant  to the Master Lease;   "REGULATORY ASSET VALUE" means the
value of the assets included in  the calculation of price control revenue as
part of a Distribution  Price Control Review;   "RELINQUISHMENT OF
OPERATIONAL CONTROL" shall have the same meaning  as used in Standard

CONTROL" shall be construed accordingly.  7.5.3 In relation to any claim or
potential claim under clause 7.5.1 the  Buyer shall allow EE Holdco to make
representations and  communications with OFGEM in respect of the same and the
provisions  of paragraphs 4 (other than 4.4), 7 and 11 of schedule 2 shall
apply  in relation to any claim under this clause 7.5, mutatis mutandis, as 
if any such claim was, for the purpose of such paragraphs, a claim  under the
Warranties.  7.5.4 If, at the time an amount is payable under clause 7.5.1,
a Clawback  Sum (as defined in, and agreed or determined in accordance
with,  schedule 6) has already been realised by the Buyer, the amount 
payable under clause 7.5.1 shall be reduced by an amount equal to 50  per
cent. of the Clawback Sum.  7.5.5 If at the time a Clawback Sum is realised
by the Buyer a payment has  already been made under clause 7.5.1, the Buyer
shall pay to EE  Holdco an amount equal to the lesser of (x) 50 per cent. of
such  Clawback Sum and (y) such payment.    11    8 BUYER\'S REMEDIES;
EE HOLDCO PROTECTIONS  8.1 If, whether before or after Completion, the Buyer
becomes aware that any  of the Warranties was untrue, inaccurate or
misleading or there has been  any breach of the Warranties or any other term
of this Agreement, the  Buyer shall not be entitled to treat this Agreement
as rescinded or  terminated but shall (for the avoidance of doubt) be
entitled to claim  damages or exercise any other right, power or remedy
under, and subject  to, this Agreement.  8.2 No liability shall attach to
EE Holdco in respect of claims under the  Warranties if and to the extent
that the limitations in schedule 2 apply  to such liability.  8.3 The Buyer
shall not be entitled to claim that any fact causes any of the  Warranties to
be breached if fairly disclosed in the Disclosure Letter or  in any document
thereby disclosed and for this purpose "fairly disclosed"  means disclosed in
such manner and such detail as to provide a reasonable  purchaser with notice
of the matter in question.  9 PENSIONS   The Parties shall implement all
the matters set out in schedule 5 at the  times and in the manner set out in
that schedule.  10 CONDUCT OF BUSINESS  10.1 For the period commencing on
the date of this Agreement and ending on the  earlier of the Completion Date
and the date of termination of this  Agreement:   (a) EE Holdco shall
procure that the Distribution Business shall be  operated in the usual and
ordinary course of business, in a  manner consistent with past practices and
in accordance with the  standard of a reasonable and prudent operator of
similar  businesses;   (b) EE Holdco shall use its reasonable endeavours
not to, and so far  as EE Holdco is reasonably able to procure that EE shall
not,  allow or procure any act or omission which would render any of  the
Warranties materially untrue, inaccurate or misleading if  repeated at any
time before or at Completion by reference to the  circumstances then
subsisting; and   (c) EE Holdco shall procure that EE shall not declare or
pay any  dividend save for that referred to in clause 5.1.6(b).  10.2
BUYER\'S ACCESS   Subject to any restrictions contained in the Distribution
Licence, or  otherwise required by any Regulatory Directive, EE Holdco shall
procure  that from the date of this Agreement until Completion:   (a) the
Buyer and its representatives shall, subject to reasonable  advance notice
being given, be given reasonable access during  normal working hours to the
premises and assets of the  Distribution Business and (subject always to EE
Holdco\'s right to  protect the confidentiality of information which does not
relate  to the Distribution Business) to all books, records, accounts,  and
documents of whatsoever kind controlled or used by the  Distribution Business
(including computer programs) and shall be  permitted to take copies of the
foregoing; and   (b) the directors and employees of the Distribution
Business shall be  instructed to give fully and promptly all such information
and  explanations relating exclusively to the Distribution Business to  the
Buyer and its representatives as may be reasonably requested.   
12    10.3 MEETINGS   Subject to any restrictions contained in the
Distribution Licence, or  otherwise required by any Regulatory Directive, EE
Holdco shall procure  that, from the date of this Agreement until Completion,
such person as  the Buyer may from time to time nominate shall be given the
same notices  and information as if he were a director and shareholder of
EE.  10.4 INSURANCE COSTS RECLAIM  10.4.1 If, as at 1 February 2002, this
Agreement has been neither Completed  nor terminated, the Parties shall
consult in respect of their  intentions in respect of the replacement of the
Policies (as defined  in paragraph 19.2 of Part C of schedule 1).  10.4.2
Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, EE Holdco shall be  entitled (in
accordance with clause 10.4.3) to invite proposals  ("PROPOSALS") for
insurance cover to be reserved or placed in  anticipation of the expiry of
the Policies.  10.4.3 In renewing or replacing the Policies, EE may seek
Proposals and then  obtain insurances on such terms, against such risks and
for such  duration as EE may consider appropriate having regard to its
normal  practices, industry requirements and commercial advantage. In
seeking  such Proposals, EE Holdco shall use its reasonable endeavours to 
procure that such Proposals are open for acceptance for as long a  period as
the issue of the Proposal may accept. As soon as EE Holdco  receives a
Proposal which is acceptable to it (and in any event prior  to placing such
insurances) EE Holdco will notify the Buyer of the  terms and costs of such
insurances ("TXU INSURANCES") and the Buyer  may as soon as reasonably
practicable in any case and at least one  clear Business Day prior to the
expiry of the period for which the  Proposal is open for acceptance, either
approve the TXU Insurances or  deliver details of alternative insurances (the
"ALTERNATIVE  INSURANCES") that it wishes EE to enter into. Provided that
the  Alternative Insurance covers EE against the same risks as, and is not 
subject to less favourable commercial terms (including deductibles  but
excluding grounds of cost or duration) than, the TXU Insurances  and is
available from underwriters approved by EE Holdco (such  approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), EE Holdco will  procure that EE accepts
the proposal relating to the Alternative  Insurances.  10.4.4 The Buyer
shall on Completion, pay to EE Holdco an amount equal to  the cost to EE (or
where such cost is incurred by a member of the  Guarantor\'s Group, the
amount recharged internally to EE) of placing  such renewal or replacement
insurances in accordance with  clause 10.4.3.  10.4.5 If EE takes out
Alternative Insurances and Completion does not occur,  the Buyer will
indemnify EE Holdco (for itself and on behalf of EE)  against all cost, loss
and expense suffered or incurred by EE Holdco  or EE as a result of having
taken the Alternative Insurances rather  than the TXU Insurances  10.5 NEW
BORROWING   EE Holdco shall procure that EE shall not enter into (or, as the
case may  be, issue) any loan arrangement, lease, sale and leaseback
arrangement,  debt instrument, bonds or other similar arrangement as a result
of which  its aggregate indebtedness for borrowed money is increased beyond
that  stated in the Exchange Balance Sheet except (i) Inter-company Debt,
or  (ii) with the prior written consent of the Buyer (not to be
unreasonably  withheld or delayed).  10.6 DISPOSALS   EE Holdco shall
procure that EE shall not (save in order to implement the  Transfer
Scheme):   (a) dispose of any asset of EE to another member of the
Guarantor\'s  Group; or   (b) dispose of any asset of EE with a value in
excess of  (pound) 5,000,000 to any person, without the prior written   
13     consent of the Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably 
withheld or delayed) and shall further procure that, in relation  to any
disposal of any asset of EE, EE shall retain, and on  Completion, make
available to the Buyer, full records of both  such disposal and the
consideration for such disposal, and the  relevant documentation which
enables the Buyer to trace the  proceeds of such disposal.  11
CONFIDENTIALITY  11.1 The Buyer shall (and shall ensure that its and EE\'s
directors, officers,  employees, agents and advisers shall) safeguard, treat
as confidential,  and not use for the purposes of its own business, all
information,  documents and materials which it has acquired or acquires in
connection  with the Transaction Documents and which relate to the business
of EE  Holdco and other past or present members of the Guarantor\'s Group
other  than (i) EE (but only insofar as such information and material relates
to  the Distribution Business; all such information and materials obtained 
(whether or not in respect of the audit of EE) which relate to any 
businesses of EE other than the Distribution Business shall be kept 
confidential as aforesaid and (ii) 24 Seven) except:   (a) as may be
required by law or by any relevant national or  supranational regulatory
authority or by the rules of any  recognised stock exchange, in which case
the Buyer shall, if  practicable, supply a copy of the required disclosure to
the  other Parties before it is disclosed and comply with the  reasonable
requests of the other Parties regarding the extent of  such disclosure;  
(b) where it has come into the public domain otherwise than through  breach
of this clause 11; and   (c) to the Buyer\'s professional and financial
advisers who are  required to know the same to carry out their duties.  12
EE HOLDCO GUARANTEE  12.1 In consideration of the Buyer entering into this
Agreement, the Guarantor  hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees
to the Buyer the due  and punctual performance by EE Holdco of all the
obligations expressed to  be incurred by EE Holdco under or pursuant to this
Agreement and the Tax  Deed (including, without limitation, to enter and
complete the same) and  undertakes to indemnify and keep indemnified the
Buyer against all  losses, damages, costs and expenses of whatsoever nature
which it may  suffer or incur by reason of any default or unreasonable delay
on the  part of EE Holdco in the performance of the said obligations.  12.2
The liability of the Guarantor shall be as primary obligor and not merely  as
surety and shall not be affected, impaired or discharged by reason of  any
act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this clause, might  operate to
release or otherwise exonerate the Guarantor from its  obligations under this
clause including, without limitation, any  arrangement made between the other
Parties or any alteration in the  obligations on the part of EE Holdco under
this Agreement and the Tax  Deed or by time or other indulgence granted by
the Buyer.  12.3 This Guarantee shall remain in force (regardless of any
change in  shareholding or control of EE Holdco) for so long as EE Holdco
shall have  any liability or obligation to the Buyer under this Agreement or
the Tax  Deed and until all such liabilities and obligations have been
discharged  in full.  13 ASSIGNABILITY  13.1 This Agreement shall be
binding on and shall enure for the benefit of  each Party\'s successors and
permitted assigns.  13.2 No Party may, without the written consent of the
other Parties, assign  any of its respective rights or obligations under this
Agreement.    14    14 REMEDIES TO BE CUMULATIVE   No remedy
conferred by any of the provisions of this Agreement is  intended to be
exclusive of any other remedy available at law, in equity,  by statute or
otherwise. Each and every other remedy shall be cumulative  and shall be in
addition to every remedy given hereunder or now or  hereafter existing at law
in equity, by statute or otherwise. The  election by any Party to pursue one
or more of such remedies shall not  constitute a waiver by such Party of the
right to pursue any other  available remedy.  15 COSTS   Each of the
Parties shall be responsible for its respective legal and  other costs
incurred in relation to the preparation and Completion of  this
Agreement.  16 FURTHER ASSURANCE   Each Party shall, and shall use its
respective reasonable endeavours to  procure that any necessary third parties
shall, execute and deliver to  the other Parties such other instruments and
documents and take such  other action as may be required to carry out,
evidence and confirm the  provisions of this Agreement.  17
ANNOUNCEMENTS  17.1 Subject as required by law or by any recognised stock
exchange or any  relevant national or supra-national regulatory authority,
all  announcements by or on behalf of any of the Parties and relating to
the  subject matter of this Agreement shall be in terms to be agreed
between  the Parties in advance of issue.  17.2 If a Party is required by
law or by any recognised stock exchange or any  relevant national or supra-
national authority to make an announcement,  that Party shall to the extent
practicable and permitted by the relevant  law, rule, order, exchange or
body:   (a) provide the other Parties with advance notice of the
requirement  and a copy of the announcement to be made; and   (b) permit
the other Parties to make representations in relation to  it with a view to
avoiding the requirement for an announcement to  be made.  18 ENTIRE
AGREEMENT  18.1 Each of the Parties on behalf of itself and as agent for
each member of  its respective Group acknowledges and agrees that:   (a)
the Transaction Documents constitute the whole and only agreement  and
understanding between the Parties in connection with EE and  24 Seven and the
matters described in them;   (b) it has not entered into the Transaction
Documents in reliance on  any Pre-contractual Statement which is not
expressly set out in  the Transaction Documents (or any of them) and, to the
extent  that any Pre-contractual Statement was made or given and is not 
expressly set out in the Transaction Documents (or any of them),  it
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any claims, rights or  remedies which
it may otherwise have in relation thereto; and   (c) it has no right of
action or other remedy whatsoever against any  other Party arising out of or
in connection with any  Pre-contractual Statement not expressly set out in
the  Transaction Documents and the only rights and remedies available  to it
in connection with the Transaction Documents (save as  otherwise provided)
are damages for breach of contract and, for    15     the avoidance of
doubt, no Party has any right to rescind all or  any of the Transaction
Documents for negligent or innocent  misrepresentation or otherwise,  
provided always that this clause 18.1 shall not exclude or limit any 
liability or any right which any Party may have in respect of  Pre-
contractual Statements made or given fraudulently or dishonestly or  in
circumstances where there has been wilful concealment.  18.2 No purported
variation of the Transaction Documents shall be effective  unless made in
writing.  19 MISCELLANEOUS  19.1 If any term or provision in this
Agreement shall be held to be illegal or  unenforceable, in whole or in part,
under any enactment or rule of law,  such term or provision or part shall to
that extent be deemed not to form  part of this Agreement but the
enforceability of the remainder of this  Agreement shall not be
affected.  19.2 A Party\'s failure to insist on strict performance of any
provision of  this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver thereof or of
any right  or remedy for breach of a like or different nature.  19.3 No
waiver shall be effective unless specifically made in writing and  signed by
a duly authorised officer of the Party granting such waiver.  19.4 This
Agreement may be entered into in any number of counterparts and by  the
Parties to it on separate counterparts, each of which when executed  and
delivered shall be an original, but all the counterparts shall  together
constitute one and the same instrument.  19.5 No term of this Agreement is
enforceable under the Contracts (Rights of  Third Parties) Act 1999 by a
person who is not a Party.  19.6 If Completion is delayed because of the
default of the Buyer and EE  Holdco is willing and able to perform its
obligations on Completion or if  the Buyer fails to pay the Purchase Price or
any of the amounts referred  to in clauses 2.6 and/or 5.2, the Buyer shall,
in addition to the payment  due under clause 2.6, 5.2 and/or 5.1.1 (as the
case may be) pay to EE  Holdco interest on the payment due under clauses 2.6,
5.2 and/or 5.1.1  (as the case may be) at a rate determined by EE Holdco to
be three per  cent. above the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate which appears on
Telerate  Page 3750 for overnight sterling deposits over the period from
(and  including) the date the payment became due (being in the case of
5.1.1  the Completion Date) to (but excluding) the date of actual making of
the  relevant payment, such interest to accrue from day to day.  20

Environmental Consents.  20.5 So far as EE Holdco is aware, for a period of
24 months ending on the  date of this Agreement, EE complied in all material
respects with all  Environmental Laws and there are no facts or circumstances
which  interfere or prevent compliance with or give rise to any liability
under  any Environmental Laws.  20.6 There are no civil, criminal,
arbitration or administrative actions,  claims, proceedings, judgements,
aware or suits current, or so far as EE  Holdco is aware pending, threatened
or outstanding against EE arising  from or relating to Environmental Consents
or Environmental Law and so  far as EE Holdco is aware there are no
circumstances which may lead to  such actions, claims, proceedings, suits,
judgements or awards.  20.7 No notice or communication has been received
from any regulatory body or  third party alleging that the Business Assets
are contaminated or are  causing contamination, pollution or harm to the
Environment and EE Holdco  is not aware of any intention on the part of any
relevant authority or  third party to give such notice or communication nor
conduct any  investigation audit in connection with such contamination or
pollution.  20.8 Copies of all agreements and memoranda of understanding
made with any  regulatory body concerning the protection of the Environment,
in  particular but not limited to the identification, investigation and 
remediation of any Business Assets, land, water source or other property 
arising from or connection with the discharge, release, leak or escape of 
transformer oil from the Business Assets, have been disclosed.  21 BUSINESS
PROPERTIES  21.1 EE has the right to use and occupy the Business Properties
without  adverse claim or possession by any third party, and any use or
occupation  of the Business Properties by EE is pursuant to an agreement the
material  terms of which are in writing.    30    21.2 Each of the
freehold and the leasehold Business Properties is free from  any Security
Interest granted by EE.  21.3 So far as EE Holdco is aware, there is no
covenant, restriction, burden  or stipulation (including, without limitation,
any condition attaching to  a planning consent or any agreement under Section
106 of the Town and  Country Planning Act 1990) affecting any of the Business
Properties which  is materially inconsistent with the use of the Business
Properties by EE  for the purposes of the Distribution Business as presently
carried on.  21.4 So far as EE Holdco is aware, none of the Business
Properties is subject  to any easement, public right, common right, wayleave,
licence, consent  or overriding interest which materially hinders EE from
carrying out the  Distribution Business as presently carried on.  21.5 So
far as EE Holdco is aware, there is no material breach of any covenant 
affecting the Business Properties which is outstanding and which could 
materially adversely affect the use and/or enjoyment of the Business 
Properties by EE.  21.6 In respect of the freehold Business Properties, EE
is the legal and  beneficial owner of each of the same, and no outstanding
options for the  sale, lease or other disposal of any of the Business
Properties has been  granted by or on behalf of EE and is
outstanding.  21.7 In respect of the leasehold Business Properties, EE has
paid the rents  and observed and performed the covenants on the part of the
Tenant in all  material respects, and has not received from any landlord or
superior  landlord notification of any material breach which remains
outstanding or  unremedied or, which, if left unremedied, would have a
material adverse  effect on the Distribution Business as presently carried
on.  21.8 So far as EE Holdco is aware, in respect of the Business
Properties EE  has a legal right free from onerous conditions to use all
roads and  conducting media (for drainage, water, electricity, gas, 
telecommunications and other services) material to each of the Business 
Properties in the manner in which they are presently used.  21.9 The current
use of the Business Properties is, so far as EE Holdco is  aware, the lawful
use for the purposes of the Planning Acts.    31     SCHEDULE 2 
LIMITATIONS ON EE HOLDCO\'S LIABILITY  1 GENERAL   Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement or this schedule to the  contrary, the provisions
of this schedule shall operate to limit the  liability of EE Holdco in
respect of any claim by the Buyer for any  breach of or inaccuracy in the
Warranties and, except where expressly  stated otherwise, any claim in
respect of Taxation or under the Tax Deed  (a "CLAIM" or "CLAIMS").  2
LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY  2.1 LIMITATION ON AMOUNT  2.1.1 The Buyer shall
not be entitled in any event to damages or any other  amount in respect of
any Claim or Claims unless and until:   (a) the aggregate amount of all such
Claims exceeds (pound)5,000,000  (in which event EE Holdco shall be liable
for the whole of such  aggregate amount (subject to the other provisions of
this  Agreement) and not only for the excess); and   (b) the amount of any
individual Claim shall exceed (pound)100,000.  2.1.2 The total aggregate
liability of EE Holdco under the Warranties and  the Tax Deed shall not in
any event exceed (pound)500,000,000 and  (subject always thereto) the total
aggregate liability of EE Holdco  under the Warranties and the Tax Deed in
respect of Claims notice of  which is served after the fifth anniversary of
Completion shall not  exceed (pound)300,000,000.  2.1.3 For the purpose of
paragraph 2.1.1(b), where a Claim relates to more  than one event,
circumstance, act or omission which event,  circumstance, act or omission
would separately constitute a breach of  or give rise to a Claim, such Claim
shall be treated as a separate  Claim in respect of each such event,
circumstance, act or omission  provided that the provisions of this sub-
paragraph shall not apply to  any Claims which arise out of substantially
similar or connected  events, circumstances, acts or omissions which Claims
shall be  aggregated and treated as a single Claim for the purpose of  sub-
paragraph 2.1.1(b).  2.2 TIME LIMITS FOR BRINGING CLAIM   No Claim shall
be brought against EE Holdco unless the Buyer shall have  given to EE Holdco
written notice of such Claim specifying (in reasonable  detail) the matter
which gives rise to the Claim, the nature of the Claim  and the Buyer\'s then
best estimate of the amount claimed in respect  thereof (detailing the
Buyer\'s calculation of the loss thereby alleged to  have been suffered by
it):   (a) on or before the fifth anniversary of Completion, in respect of 
Claims relating to Environmental Matters; or   (b) on or before the earlier
of (A) the twelfth anniversary of the  Completion Date and (B) the later of
(x) the tenth anniversary of  the Completion Date and (y) the eighth
anniversary of the filing  by or on behalf of EE of its tax return for the
last accounting  period of EE falling on or before 31 December 2001, in
respect of  Claims relating to Taxation or claims under the Tax Deed; or  
(c) on or before 30 June 2003, in respect of any other matters,   provided
that the liability of EE Holdco in respect of a Claim shall  absolutely
determine (if such Claim has not been previously satisfied,  settled or
withdrawn) if legal proceedings in respect of such Claim shall   
32     not have been commenced within nine months of the service of such
notice  (and for this purpose proceedings shall not be deemed to have been 
commenced unless they shall have been properly issued and served upon EE 
Holdco).  3 CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTY LITIGATION  3.1 Upon the Buyer becoming
aware of any claim, action or demand brought or  made by a third party
against the Buyer, EE or 24 Seven (whichever of  such parties against whom
the same are brought or made being the  "DEFENDANT") or matter which is
reasonably likely to give rise to a Claim  (other than a Claim in respect of
Taxation or under the Tax Deed, in  which case clause 5 of the Tax Deed shall
apply), the Buyer shall (or  shall procure that the relevant Defendant
shall):   (a) notify EE Holdco by written notice, as soon as it appears to
the  Buyer that EE Holdco is or may become liable under this  Agreement, of
any assessment or claim of a third party received  by or coming to the notice
of such Buyer which may result in such  a Claim;   (b) at EE Holdco\'s
expense, take such reasonable action and give such  reasonable information
and access to personnel, premises,  chattels, documents and records to EE
Holdco and its professional  advisers as EE Holdco may reasonably request and
EE Holdco shall  be entitled to require the relevant Defendant to take such 
reasonable action and give such reasonable information and  assistance in
order to avoid, dispute, resist, mitigate, settle,  compromise, defend or
appeal any claim in respect thereof or  adjudication with respect thereto
(subject always to the relevant  Defendant being indemnified to its
reasonable satisfaction and  provided that the relevant Defendant shall not
be obliged to do  any act which in its reasonable opinion is prejudicial to
the  material commercial interests of the relevant Defendant);   (c) at the
reasonable request of EE Holdco (subject to the relevant  Defendant being
indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction and  save where the relevant
Defendant considers in its reasonable  opinion that the material commercial
interests of the relevant  Defendant would be prejudiced), allow EE Holdco to
take the sole  conduct of such actions as EE Holdco may deem appropriate in 
connection with any such assessment or claim in the name of the  relevant
Defendant and in that connection the relevant Defendant  shall give or cause
to be given to EE Holdco all such assistance  as EE Holdco may reasonably
require in avoiding, disputing,  resisting, settling, compromising, defending
or appealing any  such claim and shall instruct such solicitors or other 
professional advisers as the EE Holdco and the relevant Defendant  may agree
to act on behalf of the relevant Defendant, as  appropriate;   (d) make no
admission of liability, agreement, settlement or  compromise with any third
party in relation to any such claim or  adjudication without the prior
written consent of EE Holdco (such  consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed); and   (e) take all reasonable action to mitigate any loss
suffered by it in  respect of which such Claim could be made.  3.2 In any
event, EE Holdco shall, save where the Buyer considers in its  reasonable
opinion that the material commercial interests of the relevant  Defendant
would be prejudiced, be entitled at any stage and at its sole  discretion to
settle any such third party assessment or claim (provided  that it shall take
account of any reasonable requests of the Buyer) and  shall give the Buyer
three Business Days prior notice of its decision so  to settle such
assessment or claim.  4 NO LIABILITY IF LOSS IS OTHERWISE COMPENSATED
FOR  4.1 BUYER CAN ONLY CLAIM ONCE  4.1.1 The Buyer and those deriving
title from the Buyer on or after  Completion shall not be entitled to recover
damages or otherwise  obtain reimbursement or restitution more than once
between them in  respect of any individual Claim.    33    4.1.2 EE
Holdco shall not be liable, and the Buyer shall not be entitled to  recover,
damages to the extent that the subject of the Claim (other  than a Claim in
respect of Taxation to which, together with any claim  under the Tax Deed,
clause 4 of the Tax Deed shall apply) has been  made good or is otherwise
properly compensated for without cost to the  Buyer.  4.2 TAXATION   In
calculating the liability of EE Holdco for any breach of the  Warranties
there shall be taken into account the amount (if any) by which  any Taxation
for which the Buyer or EE is now or in the future  accountable or liable to
be assessed is reduced or extinguished as a  result of the matter giving rise
to such liability and the amount of any  liability of the Buyer or EE to
Taxation in respect of the receipt of any  payment made under the
Warranties.  4.3 INSURANCE   If, in respect of any matter which would give
rise to a breach of the  Warranties, EE is entitled (or would have been so
entitled had EE  maintained in force, or but for any change in the terms of,
the policies  of insurance maintained by or on behalf of EE immediately prior
to  Completion or policies providing equivalent cover thereto) to claim
under  any policy or insurance, then no such matter shall be the subject of
a  Claim unless and until EE has made a claim against its insurers and any 
such insurance claim (or any claim which could have been made had such 
policies or their equivalents been maintained as aforesaid) shall then 
reduce or, if such reduction is greater in amount than the Claim,  extinguish
such Claim.  4.4 RECOVERY FROM THIRD PARTIES  4.4.1 Where the Buyer or EE
is at any time entitled to recover from some  other person any sum in respect
of any matter giving rise to a Claim  (other than a Claim in respect of
Taxation or under the Tax Deed in  which case clause 4 of the Tax Deed shall
apply) the Buyer or EE shall  undertake, or procure that EE shall undertake,
all reasonable steps to  enforce such recovery (subject to the Buyer or EE
being indemnified to  its reasonable satisfaction) and, in the event that the
Buyer or EE  shall recover any amount from such other person, the amount of
such  Claim against EE Holdco shall be reduced by the amount recovered,
less  all reasonable costs, charges and expenses or Taxation incurred by
the  Buyer or EE recovering that sum from such other person.  4.4.2 If EE
Holdco pays at any time to the Buyer an amount pursuant to a  Claim (other
than a Claim in respect of Taxation or under the Tax Deed  in which case
clause 4 of the Tax Deed shall apply) and the Buyer or  EE subsequently
becomes entitled to recover (or does recover) from  some other person any sum
in respect of any matter giving rise to such  Claim, the Buyer shall take, or
procure that EE shall undertake, all  reasonable steps to enforce such
recovery, and shall promptly repay to  EE Holdco so much of the amount paid
by EE Holdco to the Buyer as does  not exceed the sum recovered from such
other person less all  reasonable costs, charges and expenses or Taxation
incurred by the  Buyer or EE recovering that sum from such other
person.  4.4.3 If any amount is repaid to EE Holdco by the Buyer pursuant
to  paragraph 4.4.2 above, an amount equal to the amount so repaid shall  be
deemed never to have been paid by EE Holdco to the Buyer for the  purposes of
calculating EE Holdco\'s total aggregate liability under  paragraph
2.  4.4.4 Where the person from whom the Buyer or EE may be entitled to make
a  recovery as is referred to in clauses 4.4.1 or 4.4.2 or 24 Seven, the 
Buyer or EE shall, if so requested by EE Holdco (subject to the Buyer  or EE
being indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction) allow EE  Holdco to take
the sole conduct of such actions as EE Holdco may deem  appropriate in
connection with any such recovery in the name of the  Buyer or EE and in that
connection the Buyer or EE shall give or cause  to be given to EE Holdco all
such assistance as EE Holdco may  reasonably require in making such claim and
shall instruct such  solicitors or other professional advisers as the EE
Holdco may direct  to act on behalf of the Buyer or EE, as appropriate.   
34    5 ACTS OF BUYER   No Claim (other than a Claim in respect of
Taxation or under the Tax Deed  in which case clause 3 of the Tax Deed shall
apply) shall lie against EE  Holdco to the extent that some or all of the
amount claimed would not  have arisen but for:   (a) any voluntary act,
omission, transaction or arrangement carried  out by the Buyer or on its
behalf or by persons deriving title  from the Buyer on or after Completion;
or   (b) any admission of liability made after the date hereof by the 
Buyer or on its behalf or by persons deriving title from the  Buyer on or
after Completion other than any admission made in  accordance with paragraph
3 of this schedule or clause 5 of the  Tax Deed; or   (c) any default by 24
Seven in performing its obligations under the  network services agreement
with EE dated 14 December 1999 (as  amended from time to time) which has
occurred prior to Completion  and of which (i) the Buyer was aware and (ii)
EE Holdco was not  aware.  6 ALLOWANCE, PROVISION OR RESERVE IN ACCOUNTS OR
THE COMPLETION STATEMENT  6.1 No matter shall be the subject of a claim for
breach of any of the  Warranties to the extent that allowance, provision or
reserve in respect  of such matter has been made in the Balance Sheet, or the
Regulatory  Accounts or has been expressly included in calculating creditors
or  deducted in calculating debtors in such accounts or has been otherwise 
expressly taken account of or reflected in such accounts.  6.2 No Claim
(other than a Claim in respect of Taxation or under the Tax Deed  in which
case clause 9 of the Tax Deed shall apply) shall be made in  respect of any
matter if and to the extent that such matter was taken  into account in the
preparation of the Completion Statement (as defined  in schedule 3).  7
FUTURE LEGISLATION   No liability shall arise in respect of any Claim (other
than a Claim in  respect of Taxation or under the Tax Deed in which case
clause 3 of the  Tax Deed shall apply) to the extent that liability for such
breach occurs  or is increased wholly or partly as a result of any
legislation or any  modification to the Distribution Licence not in force at
the date of this  Agreement.  8 TAXATION/ACCOUNTING   No claim shall
arise in respect of any breach of any of the Warranties in  relation to a
liability in respect of Taxation arising from circumstances  in relation to
which clause 3 of the Tax Deed excludes any liability on  the part of EE
Holdco in respect of a Taxation Liability arising from the  same
circumstances.  9 NO LIABILITY FOR CONTINGENT OR NON-QUANTIFIABLE CLAIMS  
If any breach of the Warranties arises by reason of some liability of EE 
which, at the time such breach or claim is notified to EE Holdco, is 
contingent only or otherwise not capable of being quantified, then EE  Holdco
shall not be under any obligation to make any payment in respect  of such
breach or claim unless and until such liability ceases to be  contingent or
becomes capable of being quantified, as the case may be. So  long as such
claim shall have been notified to EE Holdco in accordance  with paragraph
2.2, as appropriate, then the proviso to paragraph 2.2  shall be amended in
relation to such claim so as to require that legal  proceedings be commenced
within nine months from the date on which the  said liability ceases to be
contingent or becomes capable of being  quantified, as the case may be, in
order for the liability of EE Holdco  not to determine.    35    10
INDEPENDENT ADVICE OF THE BUYER   The Buyer acknowledges and agrees with EE
Holdco (for itself and for the  benefit of its directors, officers, employees
and advisers and as trustee  for such directors, officers, employees and
advisers) that the Buyer has  had independent legal and financial advice
relating to the purchase of  the Sale Shares and to the terms of this
Agreement and the documents to  be executed pursuant to it, including the
terms of this paragraph.  11 PAYMENTS UNDER CLAIMS   EE Holdco and the
Buyer agree that any payments made in respect of Claims  (other than any
Claim under the Tax Deed in which case clause 2.2 of the  Tax Deed shall
apply) shall, so far as possible, be treated, for the  purposes of Taxation,
as an adjustment to the consideration given for the  Sale Shares.

in  excess of the Forecast Capex for that period, or as the case may  be,
the extent to which EE shall have incurred Capex in aggregate  less than the
Forecast Capex for that period (and so that for any  such period the extent
to which Capex is in aggregate in excess of  the relative Forecast Capex is
the "CAPEX OVERSPEND" and the  extent to which such Capex is in aggregate
less than the relative  Forecast Capex is the "CAPEX UNDERSPEND");   (b)

of  the following (such amounts being "PERMITTED CAPEX UNDERSPEND"):   (i)

UNDERSPEND");   "CAPEX 2002 AMOUNT" means the aggregate of the amounts of
Capex (as shown  in the Capex 2002 Statement) which:   (a) is not in excess

period covered by the Capex 2002  Statement (and so that the extent to which
Capex for any Capex  Period is in aggregate in excess of the aggregate
Forecast Capex  for such Capex Period is the "CAPEX Overspend"); and   (b)
is Capex Overspend falling within any of the following:   (i) it is

operational difficulties if not remedied before  it was practicable to obtain
the consent of the Buyer;   "CAPEX 2002 STATEMENT" means a statement to be

to EE, the aggregate value of  stocks, debtors, short term investments, cash

as reasonably practicable and in  any event within two months following
Completion, there shall be prepared  by the Buyer, in conjunction with the
Buyer\'s accountants and submitted  to EE Holdco for approval by EE Holdco
and Deloitte and Touche:   (a) the Working Capital Completion Statement;  
(b) the Capex 2001 Statement; and   (c) the Capex 2002 Statement,  
(together the "STATEMENTS").  2.2 EE Holdco shall review the Statements and
shall, on or before the date  (the "NOTIFICATION DATE") falling 21 days after
receipt of the Statement  by EE Holdco, inform the Buyer in writing whether
or not, in its opinion,  the Statements comply with the requirements of this
schedule and, if not,  shall notify the Buyer in writing, specifying so far
as is able to do so,  the amount and nature of any dispute. In the event that
EE Holdco shall  not have so notified the Buyer by the Notification Date,
then the  Statements shall be deemed to have been agreed.  2.3 If, as a
result of the notification referred to in paragraph 2.2, there  is any item
in dispute in relation to the Statements, EE Holdco and the  Buyer (and their
respective accountants) together with, if instructed by  EE Holdco and the
Buyer (respectively), EE\'s Auditors shall hold  discussions in good faith
with a view to reaching agreement between them  as to the subject matter of
the dispute and if such agreement is reached,  and is confirmed in writing by
both parties, it shall in the absence of  manifest error be final and
binding.  2.4 Any dispute with respect to the Statements which remains
unresolved by  the date falling seven days after the Notification Date shall,
at the  request of the Buyer, be referred for final settlement to an
independent  firm of chartered accountants nominated jointly by EE Holdco and
the  Buyer or, failing such nomination, within 7 days after request by
either  party, nominated by the President for the time being of the Institute
of  Chartered Accountants in England and Wales or his nominee. Such 
independent firm (the "EXPERT") shall act as experts and not as  arbitrators
and its decision shall (in the absence of manifest error) be  final and
binding on the parties, insofar as any matter relating to the  Statement is
concerned.  2.5 If the Expert is nominated by agreement between the parties
or by the  President for the time being of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in  England and Wales or his nominee but the formal appointment
is delayed  for more than twenty eight days after such nomination by reason
of the  failure by the parties to agree the terms required by the Expert
for  appointment (excluding Expert\'s fee but including, without
limitation,  the Expert\'s terms of reference, any indemnity that the Expert
may  require in relation to its appointment, any provision that the Expert
may  require exempting the Expert from being called as a witness in 
proceedings between the Parties in connection with the Expert\'s decision 
and any provision requiring the Expert to give or not give reasons (as  the
case may be) for the Expert\'s decision) such terms may be determined  by the
Expert and the terms so determined shall be binding of the  Parties. If such
terms are not agreed or determined within 28 days after  the nomination of
the Expert (or such longer period as the Parties may  agree in writing) the
Parties may agree (or, failing such agreement,  either Party may apply to the
President for the time being of the  Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales or his nominee)  to nominate another expert in accordance
with paragraph 2.4.    39    2.6 The fees of the Expert shall be
payable by EE Holdco on the one hand and  the Buyer on the other in such
proportions as the Expert determines or  (failing such determination) in
equal proportions.  2.7 The Buyer shall co-operate fully with EE Holdco and
its accountants and,  if applicable, with the Expert (including giving all
reasonable access to  records, working papers, information and to personnel)
and shall procure  that EE and EE\'s Auditors shall co-operate in the same
way with a view to  enabling the Statements to be prepared and subsequently
discussed, and,  if applicable, with a view to enabling the Expert to make
any  determination required by this schedule.  2.8 Upon the date that the
Statements are all agreed or deemed to have been  agreed in accordance with
paragraphs 2.2 or 2.3 or has been finally  determined in accordance with
paragraph 2.4, the Buyer shall agree or, as  the case may be, the Expert
shall certify, and deliver an appropriate  certificate to EE Holdco and the
Buyer of the amount (the "COMPLETION  ADJUSTMENT BALANCE") which is equal to
the sum of:   (a) the Working Capital of EE at Completion, as shown in the
Working  Capital Completion Statement;   (b) plus an amount equal to the
aggregate of all Adjustable Capex  Overspends as shown in the Capex 2001
Statement;   (c) less an amount equal to all Adjustable Capex Underspends as
shown  in the Capex 2001 Statement;   (d) plus the Capex 2002 Amount as
shown by the Capex 2002 Statement;  and   (e) less an amount equal to the

Exempt Approved  Scheme not being prejudiced and to the Buyer and EE
complying with the  terms of this Schedule, the Rules and all applicable
statutory  requirements, TXUEG will, subject to Inland Revenue approval,
procure the  continued participation of EE in the Pension Scheme during the 
Participation Period in respect of those Employees who are Members at the 
Completion Date in particular (but without prejudice to the generality of 
the foregoing) where those Members are Protected Persons.  (B) The Buyer
(with such assistance from TXUEG as the Buyer may reasonably  require) will
make all necessary arrangements to obtain its own  contracting-out
certificate in relation to EE and will cause the  Employees who are Members
to be in contracted-out employment by reference  to the Pension Scheme
throughout the Participation Period and promptly  after the end of the
Participation Period will make all necessary  arrangements to surrender that
certificate as of the end of the  Participation Period.  (C) The Buyer
undertakes that it shall not, and undertakes to procure that EE  and any
member of the Buyer\'s Group shall not:   (a) do or omit to do during or in
respect of the Participation Period  any act or thing which would or might
adversely affect the Exempt  Approval of the Pension Scheme or its status as
a contracted-out  scheme or cause the Pension Scheme to be in breach of any 
statutory requirement;   (b) exercise any power or discretion of a
participating employer under  the Pension Scheme except on terms (whether as
to payment of  additional contributions or otherwise) which TXUEG agrees in 
writing (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld).  (D) The Buyer
will procure the prompt payment of the following in respect of  those
Employees who are Members during and in respect of the  Participation Period
from time to time:   (i) employer\'s contributions for Members at the rate
of 13 per  cent. of their respective Salaries;   (ii) 1 per cent. of Salary
in respect of administration  expenses;   (iii) Member\'s contributions and
Member\'s AVCs in accordance with  the Rules; and   (iv) an amount equal to
the additional capital cost to the  Pension Scheme of providing benefits on
the termination of  employment, early retirement or redundancy of Employees
who  do not become Transferring Members as calculated and  advised as
appropriate by the Pension Scheme\'s actuary in  accordance with clause
13(1)(e) and rule 16 or 17 of the  ESPS Rules.  (E) The Buyer shall procure
that payment of the employer\'s and Members\'  contributions and other
payments as stated in paragraph 2(D) above are  made in cleared funds on the
twelfth day of each month and will pay  interest at the Agreed Rate on any
amount due and unpaid from time to  time. Payment under paragraph 2(D)(ii)
shall be made to or to the order  of TXUEG. Payments under paragraphs
2(D)(i)(iii), and (iv) shall be made  to the Pension Scheme.  (F) (a) In
this sub-paragraph (F):   "LIMITED EARNINGS INCREASE" means, in relation to
a Non-Consenting  Member entitled to or accruing defined benefits other than
just  lump sum death in service benefits, an increase in earnings after   
46     the Completion Date that has the effect of increasing Pensionable 
Salary, compared to what Pensionable Salary would have been if his 
Contributing Service had ended at the Completion Date, by no more  than a
percentage equal to the assumption used for salary  increases in the
Actuary\'s Letter if the period between the  Completion Date and the
termination of his Contributing Service is  one year and so in proportion for
a period other than a year. This  paragraph (F) applies separately in respect
of each Non-Consenting  Member.   (b) The Buyer will pay to the Pension
Scheme (or as it may direct) on  demand an amount in cash equal to:   (i)
the amount by which the capital value of the benefits  payable under the
Pension Scheme to or in respect of any  Non-Consenting Member is increased by
an increase in  earnings in excess of a Limited Earnings Increase by the 
Buyer (or by EE or any member of the Buyer\'s Group); plus   (ii) interest
at the Agreed Rate on the amount in sub-paragraph  (i) above in respect of
the period from (and including) the  date on which the Non- Consenting Member
ceases to be in  Contributing Service by reference to the Pension Scheme up 
to (but excluding) the date on which final payment is made  in accordance
with this sub-paragraph.   For the purposes of this sub-paragraph (F):  
(iii) the amount by which the capital value of the benefits is so  increased
is taken to be the amount by which A exceeds B  where "A" is the capital
value of the benefits payable  under the Pension Scheme (whether
immediately,  prospectively or contingently) to or in respect of the  Non-
Consenting Member on and after the date on which the  Non-Consenting Member
ceases to be in Contributing Service  and "B" is the capital value of the
benefits which would  have been so payable had earnings been increased by a 
Limited Earnings Increase;   (iv) the amount by which the capital value of
the benefits is so  increased is calculated as at the date on which the 
Non-Consenting Member ceases to be in Contributing Service  and on the basis
of the assumptions and method set out in  the Actuary\'s Letter in the same
way as the unadjusted  Transfer Amount is calculated;   (v) paragraph 5
applies to the calculation referred to in  sub-paragraph (iv) above mutatis
mutandis; and   (vi) payment in accordance with this sub-paragraph must be
made  within a period of 14 days after the calculation of the  amount by
which the capital value has been increased as  mentioned in sub-paragraphs
(iii) and (iv) above has become  final and binding in accordance with sub-
paragraph (v)  above.  (G) The Buyer shall nominate, and shall procure that
EE shall nominate, such  person as TXUEG may direct for the purpose of any
provision of or  regulations made under the Pension Schemes Act 1993 or the
Pensions Act  1995 which allow employers in multi-employer schemes to
nominate a person  to act for them for any purpose and that the Buyer will
exercise, and  shall procure that EE exercises any power and executes any
document as  TXUEG may reasonably require to implement the relevant provision
and will  not exercise any such power without TXUEG\'s consent, such consent
not to  be unreasonably delayed or refused.  (H) If any actuarial valuation
of the Pension Scheme discloses an actuarial  surplus, the principal employer
of the Pension Scheme shall have no  obligation to make arrangements to deal
with any such surplus such that  any part thereof shall be used for the
benefit of the Buyer, EE and any  member of the Buyer\'s Group or any
Employee who is a Member. If any    47     actuarial valuation of the
Pension Scheme prepared under the terms of the  ESPS discloses an actuarial
deficit, the Buyer and EE shall have no  obligation to fund or contribute
towards such deficit.  (I) TXUEG shall provide on the Buyer\'s reasonable
demand to the Buyer, on the  expiry of the Participation Period, all relevant
pensions data in respect  of Transferring Members\' participation in the
Pension Scheme.  (J) The Buyer shall provide on reasonable demand to TXUEG
accurate and  complete payroll details to enable TXUEG efficiently to
administer the  Pension Scheme during the Participation Period in accordance
with this  schedule and in compliance with all legal requirements and
regulations.  (K) The Buyer shall indemnify and keep indemnified TXUEG and
any of TXUEG\'s  Group in respect of any of the obligations of the Buyer
under this  paragraph 2.  (L) During the Participation Period, TXUEG will
procure that no alterations  are made to the benefits or contributions of any
Employee who is a Member  nor make any amendment which would reduce the
Transfer Amount without the  prior written consent of the Buyer and will not
terminate contributions  to the Pension Scheme.  (M) If any Member who
receives an Option Form (as referred to paragraph 4(A))  does not transfer
his past service rights to the Buyer\'s Scheme pursuant  to the Option Form
but does subsequently elect to transfer his past  service benefits to the
Buyer\'s Scheme within the period of two years  following the Completion Date
(each subsequent transfer to be referred to  in this paragraph 2 as a delayed
transfer) then the transfer payment from  the Pension Scheme to the Buyer\'s
Scheme in respect of that delayed  transfer will be calculated on the same
basis as if the Member had  elected to transfer his past service benefits
pursuant to the Option  Form.   Paragraph 5 and 8 of this Schedule shall
apply to delayed transfers as if  they were transfers pursuant to the Option
Form.  (N) During the Participation Period the Buyer will procure the prompt
payment  to TXUEG of an amount not exceeding (pound)1,000,000 in relation to
the  arrears of contributions by 24 Seven Utility Services Limited or 24
Seven  Contract Services Limited for the period from 1st April 2001 to the 
Completion Date and the augmentation value relating to the 24 Seven  Senior
Managers\' and P.R. Harvey\'s enhanced benefits for service up to  the
Completion Date, in respect of benefits that are approved by the PSO.   In
the event that the Completion Date is after 31st December, 2001, the  amount
of (pound)1,000,000 shall be increased by such an amount to  reflect this
delay as shall be agreed between TXUEG\'s Actuary and the  Buyer\'s
Actuary.  3 BUYER\'S SCHEME  (A) PARTICULARS OF SCHEME   Not later than
three months before the Joining Date the Buyer shall:   (a) procure that EE
shall participate in the Buyer\'s Scheme; and   (b) provide to TXUEG
particulars of the group of the ESPS that the  Buyer intends to be the
Buyer\'s Scheme for the purposes of this  schedule. For Members entitled to
or accruing defined benefits  other than just lump sum death in service
benefits, the scheme (or  each such scheme) must be a scheme which as at the
Due Payment  Date satisfies the terms of paragraph 3(B) below.  (B)  (a)
General conditions  ------------------    48     The Buyer will
procure that at the Joining Date the Buyer\'s Scheme:   (i) is established
and wholly administered in the United Kingdom;   (ii) is Exempt Approved
under chapter 1 of part XIV of ICTA 1988 (or  designed so as to be capable of
such approval) as an occupational  defined benefits scheme; and   (iii) is
contracted-out and a scheme to which the Pension Scheme is  permitted by law
to make a transfer payment in respect of the  entire rights under the Pension
Scheme of the Transferring Members  (including rights to guaranteed minimum
pensions and section 9(2B)  rights).  (b) Future service benefits 
-----------------------   The Buyer will, and will procure that the Buyer\'s
Scheme will, make the  offers described below and provide as at and from the
Joining Date the  benefits described below in respect of persons who accept
the offers.  Each Employee will be offered, in relation to employment from
and after  the Joining Date, membership of the Buyer\'s Scheme on the
following  basis:   (i) with benefits that TXUEG\'s Actuary and the
Buyer\'s Actuary shall  agree mirror those that would prospectively have been
provided  (including where such benefits comprise enhancements granted on
an  individual basis for the Senior Manager) by the Pension Scheme to  and
in respect of that Member if he had continued in membership  after the
Joining Date (assuming that the Pension Scheme and the  Senior Manager\'s
enhanced benefits are not altered after the date  of this agreement except as
mentioned in any document disclosed to  the Buyer as part of the transaction
in which this agreement was  made) and taking account of the required amounts
of Members\'  contributions including the current member contribution
reduction  until 31st March 2002 but not any member contribution reduction 
thereafter. The offer will not be conditional on the Employee  agreeing to
transfer to the Buyer\'s Scheme the value of his  accrued rights in the
Pension Scheme;   (ii) the Buyer will procure that Members at the Completion
Date can  continue to convert AVCs into benefits on the same terms 
applicable in the Pension Scheme at the Completion Date. Where a 
Transferring Member was purchasing added years while participating  in the
Pension Scheme, the Buyer will make arrangements that  mirror those under the
Buyer\'s Scheme.  (c) Past service benefits  ---------------------   (i)
The Buyer will, and will procure that the Buyer\'s Scheme will,  make the
offers described below and, in consideration of receipt  of the Transfer
Amount, provide the benefits described below in  respect of persons who
accept the offers.   (ii) Each person who is an Employee and a Member at the
Joining Date in  respect of his Contributing Service in the Pension Scheme
will be  offered benefits that TXUEG\'s Actuary and the Buyer\'s Actuary 
shall agree mirror those applying (including where such benefits  comprise
enhancements granted on an individual basis for the  Senior Manager) for and
in respect of him under the Pension Scheme  immediately before the Joining
Date in relation to his  Contributing Service.   (iii) Each person referred
to above who has paid AVCs will, subject to  receipt of assets representing
the person\'s AVCs, be offered  benefits which are at least equal in value to
the amount to be  paid by the Pension Scheme to the Buyer\'s Scheme in
respect of  AVCs and provide such benefits (in addition to any others) for
and  in respect of each such person who becomes a Transferring Member.  
(iv) In respect of additional voluntary contributions to the Pension  Scheme
that have been made to buy added years under that scheme,  the Buyer shall
offer benefits that mirror the extent permitted by    49     the PSO,
those provided in the Pension Scheme with respect to the  same service and
contributions. To the extent that benefits of  Protected Persons cannot be
mirrored because of PSO limits,  benefits of equal value to those that cannot
be mirrored will be  provided in the Buyer\'s Scheme to the extent possible
within PSO  limits.   (v) The Buyer shall procure that the Buyer\'s Scheme
contains a rule  the same as Rule 8(3) of the Rules with respect to the
benefits  that Employees who are Members who join the Buyer\'s Scheme
accrue  under the Buyer\'s Scheme based on the level of Salary that would 
have applied for the purpose of the option under that Rule 8(3)  had the
Employee continued as a Member.   (vi) The Buyer shall procure that each
Transferring Member is given the  same period of (in terms of months and
years) Contributing Service  as that which that Transferring Member had under
the Pension  Scheme.  4 NOTICES TO EMPLOYEES  (A) Not later than two
months before the Joining Date the Buyer will issue a  notice in a form
agreed by TXUEG and the Buyer (such agreement not to be  unreasonably
withheld or delayed) to the Employees who are Members  inviting them to join
the Buyer\'s Scheme for future service and offering  them the ability to
transfer the value of their accrued rights under the  Pension Scheme to the
Buyer\'s Scheme by completing an Option Form, such  Option Form to be
returned no later than one week before the Joining  Date. The notice shall
explain the options available to the persons  concerned under the Pension
Scheme in respect of their accrued rights.  (B) This paragraph 4 shall not
apply where the Joining Date is accelerated  because of the Buyer\'s default.
The Buyer shall supply to TXUEG the draft  notice for TXUEG\'s comments three
weeks before the draft notice shall be  issued to Members. TXUEG shall supply
its comments on the draft notice to  the Buyer within two weeks of its
receipt. The Buyer will then submit a  further draft to TXUEG having
considered TXUEG\'s comments for final  agreement within one week, such
agreement not to be unreasonably  withheld. The Buyer will issue the notice
and the Option Form to the  relevant Employees as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter.  (C) The parties acknowledge the obligations of the
Pension Scheme under  Regulation 27A of the Occupational Pension Schemes
(Preservation of  Benefit) Regulations 1991 and will co-operate with each
other and the  Pension Scheme with a view to assisting the Pension Scheme in
complying  with that Regulation.  5 CALCULATION OF TRANSFER AMOUNT   The
Buyer shall provide to TXUEG any documents and information which is 
reasonably required for the calculation of the Transfer Amount. TXUEG\'s 
Actuary will calculate the Transfer Amount as soon as reasonably  practicable
and in any event within two months following the Joining Date  or two months
following receipt of the documents and information required  for the
calculation of the Transfer Amount if later. As soon as  reasonably
practicable and in any event within 14 days after TXUEG\'s  Actuary has
calculated the Transfer Amount (excluding the amount of the  interest and
Investment Adjustment but including particulars of the  manner in which they
are to be calculated) TXUEG will notify the Buyer of  the result of that
calculation and supply to the Buyer\'s Actuary  particulars of the
calculation and the data on which it is based which he  reasonably requires
to enable him to check that the calculation is  mathematically correct and
made in accordance with the provisions of this  schedule. The Buyer\'s
Actuary has one month from the date on which those  particulars and data have
been supplied to him in which he may raise any  objection that the
calculation is incorrect. The calculation will be  final and binding on TXUEG
and the Buyer on the later of:   (i) if the Buyer\'s Actuary raises no
objection within the terms  mentioned above, the expiry of the period
mentioned above in which  he may raise an objection;    50     (ii) if
the Buyer\'s Actuary raises an objection as mentioned above, the  date of a
subsequent written agreement between TXUEG\'s Actuary and  the Buyer\'s
Actuary that the calculation (or revised calculation)  is correct; or  
(iii) if a reference is made to an independent actuary under paragraph  12
below, the date of his determination of the disputed issue.  6 TRANSFER OF
TRANSFER AMOUNT AND AVCS  (A) TXUEG will use all reasonable endeavours to
procure that on the Due  Payment Date the Pension Scheme transfers to the
Buyer\'s Scheme the  Transfer Amount and the assets representing, as at the
date of transfer,  the AVCs paid by the Transferring Members together with
the accrued  investment returns on such AVCs.  (B) The Buyer will seek
promptly from the Board of Inland Revenue approval to  the transfer of assets
from the Pension Scheme to the Buyer\'s Scheme in  respect of the
Transferring Members and, at the Buyer\'s request, TXUEG  will supply
promptly to the Buyer the documents and information which the  Buyer
reasonably requires for this purpose.  7 FORM OF TRANSFER   TXUEG and the
Buyer will use all reasonable endeavours to secure  agreement between the
Pension Scheme and the Buyer\'s Scheme respectively  as to the particular
assets to be transferred representing the Transfer  Amount. If agreement is
not reached by the Due Payment Date, a transfer  will be made in cash with a
reduction of 1 per cent. Any securities to be  transferred will be valued at
the mid-market price at the close of  business on The London Stock Exchange
on the day before the date of  transfer.  8 PAYMENTS BY EE HOLDCO AND
BUYER  (A) If the Transfer Amount is not transferred in full to the Buyer\'s
Scheme  within one week after the Due Payment Date as provided for in
paragraph 6  above, EE Holdco shall, subject to sub-paragraphs (B) and (C)
below, not  later than one month after receipt of a written demand from the
Buyer,  pay to the Buyer, by way of an adjustment of the Purchase Price,
the  following amount:   (a) if some assets have been transferred from the
Pension Scheme to  the Buyer\'s Scheme (whether before or after that written
demand is  received) - the amount by which the Transfer Amount (calculated
as  at the date on which those assets were transferred) exceeds the  value
so transferred but the excess for this purpose shall:   (i) be the excess
adjusted by the Investment Adjustment from  (and including) the date of that
transfer up to (but  excluding) the date of payment by EE Holdco pursuant
to  this sub-paragraph; and   (ii) be reduced (after the adjustment in sub-
paragraph (i)  above) if, despite some assets having been transferred to 
the Buyer\'s Scheme, any benefit remains payable to or in  respect of a
Transferring Member under the Pension Scheme;  the reduction will be by the
aggregate of the cash  equivalents of those benefits; or   (b) if no assets
have been transferred - the amount by which the  Transfer Amount (calculated
as at the date on which payment is  made to the Buyer in accordance with this
sub-paragraph) exceeds  the aggregate of the cash equivalents of the benefits
remaining  payable to or in respect of the Transferring Members under the 
Pension Scheme when payment is made in accordance with this  sub-
paragraph;   less (in either case):    51     (c) any amount due
after any Investment Adjustment from the Buyer to  EE Holdco or the Pension
Scheme under this schedule.   For the purpose of this sub-paragraph each of
the Transferring Members in  respect of whom benefits are so payable shall be
deemed to have a right  to a cash equivalent.   The amount derived under
sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) above is referred to  below as the
"SHORTFALL".  (B) If any of the Transfer Conditions ceases to be fulfilled
or effective,  the Buyer shall not demand payment pursuant to sub-paragraph
(A) above  and the time limit referred to in sub-paragraph (A) above will
not  commence, or (if any of the Transfer Conditions cease to be fulfilled
or  effective after the time limit has started to run) will be suspended, 
until all those conditions are again fulfilled and effective.  (C) No
payment shall be due from EE Holdco pursuant to sub-paragraph (A)  above if
the reason for the Transfer Amount (or part of it) not having  been
transferred to the Buyer\'s Scheme by the expiry of the time limit  referred
to above is the failure of the Buyer\'s Scheme for whatever  reason to accept
the whole or any part of the Transfer Amount or if the  reason is any other
reason outside the control of EE Holdco or the  Pension Scheme but, if no
payment is due from EE Holdco because of any  such other reason outside the
control of EE Holdco or the Pension Scheme,  payment will become due (subject
to the other provisions of this  paragraph) if and when such reason ceases to
exist.  (D) If payment is made by EE Holdco in accordance with sub-paragraph
(A)  above the amount of that payment will be deducted from the amount 
otherwise payable under paragraph 6 of this schedule.  (E) If EE Holdco pays
to the Buyer an amount pursuant to this paragraph:   (i) forthwith following
EE Holdco making the payment the Buyer shall  procure that an amount equal to
the payment shall be contributed  to the Buyer\'s Scheme; and   (ii) the
Buyer, EE and all members of the Buyer\'s Group shall take all  reasonable
steps (including the claiming of any relevant deduction  from profits and any
repayment of tax) to maximise the Aggregate  Tax Benefit, and the Buyer
shall, 14 days after the earlier of the  date on which the Aggregate Tax
Benefit has been finally  determined by the Inland Revenue (allowing for the
maximum  permitted spread under accounting principles and ICTA 1988) and 
the date which falls 4 years after the Completion Date (in which  case it
shall be a best estimate of the Aggregate Tax Benefit  agreed between the
Buyer and EE Holdco), pay to EE Holdco, by way  of adjustment to the Purchase
Price, an amount equal to the  Aggregate Tax Benefit, adjusted (if payment is
not made within the  14 day period) by the Investment Adjustment from (and
including)  the earlier of those two dates to (but excluding) the date of 
payment.  (F) (a) Subject to paragraph (F)(b), if, for a reason outside
TXUEG\'s  control, the value of the aggregate of the assets transferred by 
the Pension Scheme to the Buyer\'s Scheme and the assets  transferred by EE
Holdco to the Buyer under this paragraph (in the  case of non-cash assets
based on the value of the assets  transferred as at the date of transfer)
exceeds the Transfer  Amount, the Buyer shall, within one month of such an
excess having  been transferred, pay to EE Holdco, by way of an adjustment of
the  Purchase Price, a sum in cash equal to such excess (less a best 
estimate, agreed between the Buyer and EE Holdco, of the Aggregate  Tax
Benefit which the TXUEG Group has obtained or could have  obtained as a
result of paying the excess into the Pension Scheme  by way of contribution)
adjusted by the Investment Adjustment from  (and including) the date of
transfer of the excess to the Buyer\'s  Scheme up to (but excluding) the date
of payment of the excess by  the Buyer to EE Holdco.   (b) If the reason
for such payment in excess of the Transfer Amount is  one of manifest error,
the Buyer and TXUEG will first use all  reasonable endeavours (and subject to
any legal and Inland Revenue    52     restrictions) to procure that
the trustees of the Buyer\'s Scheme  return the excess to the trustees of the
Pension Scheme and, to  the extent that this is possible and practical, the
provisions of  paragraph (a) above shall not then apply.  (G) In this
paragraph 8:   "BUYER\'S GROUP" means the Buyer and any company which is a
member of the  same group of companies as the Buyer for the purposes of
Chapter IV of  Part X of ICTA 1988 and "member of the Buyer\'s Group" means
any such  company.   "TXUEG\'S GROUP" means TXUEG and any company which is
a member of the same  group of companies as TXUEG for the purposes of Chapter
IV of Part X of  ICTA 1988 and "member of TXUEG\'s Group" means any such
company.   "TAX BENEFIT" means the aggregate of the amount by which the
relevant  company\'s liability to pay corporation tax is or will be reduced
and the  amount of any repayment of corporation tax to which the relevant
company  is or will be entitled, which, in either case, arises as a result of
the  contribution referred to in paragraph (E)(i) or F(a) above (including
any  such reduction or right which is attributable to a surrender by way of 
group relief or consortium relief under sections 402 to 413, ICTA 1988 of  a
loss which arises as a result of the payment of the contribution); and  
"AGGREGATE TAX BENEFIT" means, in (E) above, the aggregate of any Tax 
Benefits arising to the Buyer, EE and the Buyer\'s Group in respect of the 
contribution referred to in (E)(i) above and in (F) above the aggregate  of
the actual Tax Benefit (or potential Tax Benefit that would have  arisen if
the contribution had been paid into the Pension Scheme) arising  to EE Holdco
and any member of the TXUEG Group in respect of the  contribution referred to
in (F)(a) above.  9 TXUEG\'S PROTECTION  (A) In this paragraph:  
"CLAIM" means a claim by a Claimant relating to:   (a) any Relevant Benefit;
and/or   (b) access to any Relevant Benefit or to a scheme providing any 
Relevant Benefit,   attributable to employment from and after Completion
and, in the case of  a Transferring Member (or any person claiming through or
in respect of  him), attributable to employment before Completion but only in
connection  with guaranteed minimum pensions and equalisation of access to
any scheme  that comprises any Relevant Benefits), which it is alleged TXUEG
or the  Pension Scheme is liable to provide for or in respect of a
Transferring  Member.   "CLAIMANT" means an Employee or any person claiming
benefit through or in  respect of him.   "LIABILITY" includes any
compensation, damage, loss or requirement of any  court, industrial tribunal
or Pensions Ombudsman order, award or  direction, and costs and expenses
properly incurred.   "LIABILITY AMOUNT" means the amount of any Liability
incurred or  sustained by TXUEG or any member of the Pension Scheme or the
Pension  Scheme arising out of or in connection with a Claim by a
Claimant.   "RELEVANT BENEFIT" is construed in accordance with section 612
of the  Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.    53    (B) The Buyer
will indemnify, and keep indemnified on an after tax basis,  TXUEG, each
member of the TXUEG Group and the Pension Scheme against any  Liability
Amount.  (C) To the extent that this indemnity relates to a Claim against a
member of  the TXUEG Group (other than TXUEG) or the Pension Scheme, TXUEG
holds the  benefit of the indemnity as trustee for that member or the Pension
Scheme  (as the case may be). Without prejudice to the ability of that person
to  enforce the indemnity, TXUEG as trustee for him may enforce the 
indemnity. The consent of any of the TXUEG Group or the Pension Scheme  shall
not be necessary for any variation (including any release or  compromise in
whole or in part of any liability) or termination of this  paragraph
9.  (D) In quantifying any Liability Amount, the assumptions in the
Actuary\'s  Letter shall be applied as nearly as practicable and, in default
of  agreement as to how it should apply, the disagreement shall be resolved 
in accordance with paragraph 12.  (E) If TXUEG becomes aware of any claim,
action or demand brought or made by  anyone against TXUEG or the Pension
Scheme or a matter which is  reasonably likely to give rise to such a claim,
action or demand, TXUEG  shall promptly give written notice to the Buyer of
such a claim, action  or demand. The Buyer shall be wholly responsible for
the conduct of such  a claim and may settle or compromise any such claim if
it thinks fit.  TXUEG shall give the Buyer any such information, document and
access to  persons as the Buyer may reasonably request to enable the Buyer to
deal  with such claims.  10 BUYER\'S PROTECTION  (A) If for any reason
the transfer scheme made by EE and approved by the  Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry which had an effective date of  1st October 2001 under
Part I of Schedule 7 to the Utilities Act 2000 did  not effectively transfer
to TXU UK Limited all liabilities (including  contingent and future
liabilities) to protected persons under or arising  out of Regulation 19 of
the Electricity (Protected Persons) England and  Wales Regulations 1990 as a
successor company within the meaning of those  Regulations, EE Holdco and
TXUEG shall indemnify the Buyer and EE and  keep them indemnified on an after
tax basis against all such liabilities.  (B) Other than in respect of the
Buyer\'s payment of employer\'s contributions  during the Participation
Period as set out in this schedule, TXUEG shall  indemnify the Buyer on an
after tax basis against all costs, liabilities  and expenses arising or which
may arise out of the operation of section  75 of the Pensions Act 1995 in
respect of the Participation Period,  except where such cost is attributable
to an act or omission of the Buyer  or any of EE, 24 Seven Utility Services
Limited and 24 Seven Contract  Services Limited or any of the Buyer\'s
Group.  11 NO ASSISTANCE   The Buyer agrees that it will not, and will
procure that the Buyer\'s  Scheme and the Buyer\'s Group will not, take any
action or provide any  assistance to any person (direct or indirect) which
might result in the  Pension Scheme transferring a smaller or a larger amount
than the  Transfer Amount and the assets representing Transferring Members\'
AVCs to  the Buyer\'s Scheme. This undertaking does not apply to any
obligation  that the Buyer or the Buyer\'s Scheme may have to pay the costs
or the  expenses of the trustees or members of the Buyer\'s Scheme or where
the  Buyer or the Buyer\'s Scheme is under a legal obligation to provide 
information to any party.  12 DISPUTES  (A) Any dispute between TXUEG and
the Buyer or between TXUEG\'s Actuary and  the Buyer\'s Actuary concerning
the calculation of the Transfer Amount or  compliance with paragraph 2, 3 and
paragraph 9 above as it relates to the  actuarial assumptions described in
paragraph 9(D) shall, in the absence  of agreement between them within one
month of the party concerned having  notified the other in writing of the

acting as an expert and not as  an arbitrator and his decision shall be final
and binding. The fees and  expenses of the independent Actuary and of the
President shall be borne  equally between TXUEG and the Buyer, except that
the independent actuary  shall have power to determine, at the request of
either of TXUEG or the  Buyer, that the fees and expenses shall be borne
exclusively by TXUEG or  the Buyer or in such proportions as the independent
actuary may determine  and any such determination shall be final and
binding.  (B) Any dispute between TXUEG and the Buyer concerning the
calculation of the  Aggregate Tax Benefit for the purpose of paragraph 8

referred to an  independent accountant chosen by agreement between TXUEG and
the Buyer  or, failing agreement, appointed by the President for the time
being of  the Institute of Chartered Accountants, at the instance of either
party.  The independent accountant shall determine the disputed matter acting
as  an expert and not as an arbitrator and his decision shall be final and 
binding. The fees and expenses of the independent accountant and of the 
President shall be borne equally between TXUEG and the Buyer, except that 
the independent accountant shall have power to determine, at the request  of
either of TXUEG or the Buyer, that the fees and expenses shall be  borne
exclusively by TXUEG or the Buyer or in such proportions as the  independent
accountant may determine and any such determination shall be  final and
binding.  13 UNDERTAKING   The Buyer shall co-operate with TXUEG in order
to enable TXUEG to obtain  a new contracting-out certificate in its name or
the name of any member  of the TXUEG Group.  14 WARRANTIES  (A) Except
pursuant to the Pension Scheme, EE has not paid, provided or  contributed
towards, and EE is not under any obligation and no proposal  has been
announced to pay, provide or contribute towards, any relevant  benefit, as
defined in section 612, ICTA 1988, for or in respect of any  Employee or any
spouse, child or dependant of any Employee.  (B) The documents identified in
the Disclosure Letter comprise the documents  governing the Pension Scheme in
respect of the Employees including the  written communications to the
Employees describing the terms of the  Pension Scheme (other than routine
benefit statements) of current effect  and also including the particulars of
any enhancements in respect of any  Employee and of any current discretionary
practice during the period of  EE\'s membership of the Guarantor\'s Group
under which the Employee\'s  benefits may be enhanced.  (C) Membership data
relating to Employees who are members of the Pension  Scheme has been
supplied to the Purchaser and is materially correct.  (D) So far as EE
Holdco is aware, there is no dispute about the benefits  payable under the
Pension Scheme in respect of any Employee and so far as  EE Holdco is aware
there are no circumstances which would give rise to  any such dispute.  (E)
Except in relation to guaranteed minimum pensions, so far as EE Holdco is 
aware, the Pension Scheme complies with all applicable laws, regulations  and
Inland Revenue requirements which relate to any Employee in respect  of their
membership of the Pension Scheme.  (F) The Pension Scheme is approved as an
exempt approved scheme (within the  meaning of section 592 Taxes Act 1988)

Woodrow  Parkside House Our ref:CAG/saf/0537-doc  Ashley Road  Epsom 
Surrey  KT18 5BS    Dear Ian:   Project Wing (EE)   This is the
Actuary\'s Letter referred to in Schedule 5 of the Agreement  relating to
Pensions.   Yours sincerely  For Bacon and Woodrow   /s/C. A. Groves 
-----------------  Mrs. C. A. Groves  (TXUEG\'s Actuary)  
Countersigned   /s/I. Edwards  ----------------  Mr. I. Edwards 
(Buyer\'s Actuary)   Enc.    57    BACON and WOODROW  Actuaries and
Consultants   TXU   Actuarial Methods and Assumptions for the calculation
of the Transfer Amount  for Pension Scheme members as defined in Schedule 5
Pensions.  1. Actuarial Method   The past service liabilities will be
calculated for the Transferring  Members in accordance with the actuarial
assumptions set out in section 2  below using pensionable service to and
Salary or Pensionable Salary (as  the case requires) over the year to the
Completion Date, and adjusted to  the Actual Payment Date in accordance with
the provisions in sections 3  and 4 below. The past service liabilities will
be based on the benefit  structure applying for and in respect of each
Transferring Member  immediately prior to the Completion Date.   For this
purpose pensionable service includes any additional service  resulting from a
previous transfer in or the accrued part of any added  years secured by
additional member contributions. In the event that a  Transferring Member\'s
Salary or Pensionable Salary represents less than a  full year, it should be
grossed up to the annual equivalent.   For the avoidance of doubt the past
service liabilities shall include the  accrued element of the Transferring
Member\'s ill health pension and death  in service pensions. It shall take no
account of benefits for service  after the Completion Date.  2. Actuarial
Assumptions   Investment return The annualized gross redemption yield on 
the FT-Actuaries 20 Year Gilt Index (at  close of business on the day before
the  Completion Date), plus 1.75% pa prior to  retirement/0.75% pa after
retirement,  rounded to the nearest 0.01% pa compound   Increases in prices
100 x [[(1+G)/(1+I)-1]% pa where G is the  annualized gross redemption yield
on the  FT-Actuaries 20 Year Gilt Index (at close  of business on the day
before the  Completion Date), and I is the arithmetic  average of the
annualized gross redemption  yields on the FT-Actuaries Over 5 Year  Index-
Linked Gilt Index with 0% and 5%  inflation (at close of business on the
day  before the Completion Date), respectively.  The figure shall be rounded
to the nearest  0.01% pa compound   Salary or Pensionable 1.0% pa (with no
averaging at the  Salary increases in annualized date of exit from active 
excess of increases in membership) plus an allowance for  prices promotional
increases in line with the  attached table   Increases in Section 1.0% pa

Widowers + 2 years   Family Details 90% of members are assumed to be
married  at retirement or death before retirement.  A man is assumed to be 2
years older than  his wife.  3. Market Value Adjustment   The liabilities
assessed using the above actuarial assumptions shall be  increased to the
Actual Payment Date by assuming investment at the  Completion Date in the
following indices:   1. 80% in the FT-Actuaries All-Share index   2. 20%
in the FT-Actuaries 5-15 Years Fixed Interest Gilt index.   The value shall
be increased to the Actual Payment Date by reference to  the published total
return indices reduced by 0.1% pa to allow for  investment expenses. More
precisely, the total return on the portion in  each of 1 and 2 above before
reduction for investment expenses will be  determined as the total return
index at close of business on the last  working day before the Actual Payment
Date divided by the total return  index at close business on the last working
day before the Completion  Date. The market value of the liabilities at the
Actual Payment Date is  then the product of a) and b) below reduced by 0.1%
pa between Completion  Date and Actual Payment Date.   a) the market value
of the liabilities at Completion Date   b) the sum of the ratios of the
relevant total return  indices multiplied by the national investment in
those  indices at the Completion Date.    59    BACON and
WOODROW  Actuaries and Consultants  4. Transfer Amount   The Transfer
Amount at the Actual Payment Date will be:   a) the value of the liabilities
at the Actual Payment Date as  calculated under 3 above, plus   b) the
Members\' Contributions less the Retained Costs having adjusted  each net
contribution between the day of receipt by the Pension  Scheme of the
relevant contribution to the Actual Payment Date, by  the ratio of the total
return index of the FT-Actuaries All-Share  index at close of business on the
last working day before the Actual  Payment Date to the total return index of
the FT-Actuaries All-Share  index at close of business on the last working
day before the day of  receipt by the Pension Scheme of the relevant
contribution.   c) the value, if any, at Joining Date calculated using the
actuarial  assumptions in 2 above of contributions at the rate of 1% of 
Salaries payable monthly in arrears from Completion Date to 31 March  2002 in
respect of Transferring Members who were Members of the  Eastern Group of
ESPS on 31 March 1999 and who remain as such  immediately before Joining Date
and who agree to join the Buyer\'s  Scheme from the Joining Date. This value
shall be adjusted between  Joining Date to the Actual Payment Date by the
ratio of the total  return index of the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index at close
of  business on the last working day before Actual Payment Date to the 
total return index of the FT-Actuaries All-Share index at close of  business
on the last working day before Joining Date.    60    BACON and
