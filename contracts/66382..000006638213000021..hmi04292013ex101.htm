indemnification claims, Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction instructing the Escrow
Agent to release to Sellers in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages any
remaining balance of the Escrow Deposit and the Escrow Deposit shall be
reduced to zero. Any interest earned on any cash deposited in the
Indemnification Escrow shall not be considered part of the Indemnification
Escrow and shall be for the account of Sellers, and shall be released to
Sellers in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.



(d) On or prior to Closing, Buyer shall cash collateralize that certain
Standby Letter of Credit in the principal amount of $285,000 issued by
Citibank, N.A. for the account of the Company in favor of F.M. Ring
Associates, Inc., as beneficiary, relating to the security deposit under the
Park Avenue Lease (the "Standby Letter of Credit"), in the amount of Two
Hundred Eighty-Five Thousand Dollars ($285,000) (the "Cash Collateral
Amount"). After the Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Company to replace the Standby Letter of Credit as promptly as
practicable and in any case within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date. On
the earlier to occur of such replacement and the expiration of such ninety
(90) day period, Buyer shall cause the Company to pay to the Sellers in cash
an amount equal to the Cash Collateral Amount in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Percentages.



2.3 Seller Distributions. Prior to the date hereof, the Company distributed to
Sellers in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages (a) the
Company's art and library assets described on Schedule 2.3 (the "Art and
Library Assets") and (b) the proceeds from the repayment of outstanding
principal and accrued and unpaid interest evidenced by those certain loan
receivables described on Schedule 2.3 (collectively, the "Distributions").
With respect to the distribution of the Art and Library Assets, each Seller

Library Assets in accordance with such Seller's Pro Rata Percentage. Sellers
may at any time following the Closing Date transfer all or any portion of the
Art and Library Assets without restriction imposed by this Agreement or the
Loan Agreement.



2.4 Calculation of Tangible Equity Amount and Closing Cash.



(a) On the Closing Date, Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall mutually
determine the amount of Adjusted Closing Cash. Within sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall (at its cost and expense) prepare and deliver to
Sellers' Representative Buyer's good faith written calculation (the "Tangible
Equity Calculation") of the Tangible Equity Amount in accordance with GAAP and
the amount of any Tangible Equity Adjustment based on such Tangible Equity
Calculation. 





(b) Buyer shall provide Sellers' Representative with access to all relevant
information used by Buyer in preparing the Tangible Equity Calculation.
Sellers' Representative shall, within sixty (60) days after delivery by Buyer
of the Tangible Equity Calculation, complete its review of the Tangible Equity
Calculation. If Sellers\' Representative determines in good faith that the
Tangible Equity Calculation has not been determined in accordance with this
Section 2.4, or if a disagreement between Sellers' Representative and Buyer
remains unresolved with respect to the Tangible Equity Calculation, then in
either case, Sellers' Representative shall inform Buyer on or before the last
day of such sixty (60) day period by delivering a written notice to Buyer
("Notice of Objection") setting forth a specific and detailed description of
the basis of Sellers' Representative's objection and proposed adjustments to
the Tangible Equity Calculation. After receipt of the Notice of Objection,
Buyer shall then have thirty (30) days to review and respond to the Notice of
Objection. Buyer and its representatives shall have access to all relevant
information used in connection with the preparation of the Notice of
Objection. Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall seek in good faith to
mutually resolve any differences which they may have with respect to any
matter specified in the Notice of Objection. If Sellers' Representative does
not properly and timely deliver a Notice of Objection, Sellers shall
conclusively be deemed to have accepted the Tangible Equity Calculation.



(c) If Buyer and Sellers' Representative are unable to mutually resolve all of
their disagreements with respect to any matter specified in the Notice of
Objection within thirty (30) days following Seller's delivery of the Notice of
Objection, then Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall refer their remaining
differences (such differences, the "Disputed Amounts") under this Agreement to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or any other nationally known accounting firm that
is not at such time the auditor of Buyer or any member of the Company Group
and that is mutually acceptable to Buyer and Sellers' Representative (the
"Determining Party"). Each of Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall prepare
and submit to the Determining Party a statement of its position with respect
to the Disputed Amounts under this Section 2.4. Buyer and Sellers'
Representative shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i)
the Determining Party to render its determination of the Disputed Amounts in
accordance with this Section 2.4(c) along with a statement of reasons therefor
within thirty (30) days of submission and (ii) the Determining Party's
determination of the Disputed Amounts to be no less than the lesser of the
amount claimed by either Sellers' Representative or Buyer and to be no greater
than the greater of the amount claimed by either Sellers' Representative or
Buyer; provided, that, if, notwithstanding the commercially reasonable efforts
of Sellers' Representative and Buyer, (x) the Determining Party's
determination of any Disputed Amount is less than the lesser of the amounts
claimed by either Sellers' Representative or Buyer, then such disputed amount
shall be deemed to be the lesser of the amounts claimed by either Sellers'
Representative or Buyer or (y) the Determining Party's determination of any
Disputed Amount is more than the greater of the amounts claimed by either
Sellers' Representative or Buyer, then such disputed amount shall be deemed to
be the greater of the amounts claimed by either Sellers' Representative or
Buyer. Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall make readily available on a
timely basis to the Determining Party all relevant books and records and any
work papers and audit programs (including those of the parties' respective
accountants), if any, and all other information and items reasonably requested
by the Determining Party to facilitate its timely determination of the matters
subject to its review. The Determining Party's determination shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Sellers for all purposes. In the event
that Buyer and Sellers' Representative submit any Disputed Amounts to the
Determining Party for resolution, Sellers and Buyer shall each pay their own
fees, costs and disbursements incurred under this Section 2.4(c). Sellers
shall be responsible for that fraction of the fees, costs and disbursements of
the Determining Party equal to (1) the absolute value of the difference
between Sellers' Representative's aggregate position with respect to the
Disputed Amounts and the Determining Party's final determination with respect
to the Disputed Amounts over (2) the absolute value of the difference between
Sellers' Representative's aggregate position with respect to the Disputed
Amounts and Buyer's aggregate position with respect to the Disputed Amounts,
and Buyer shall be responsible for the remainder of such fees and costs.



(d) Upon the final determination of the Tangible Equity Amount (whether by the
failure of Sellers' Representative to properly and timely deliver a Notice of
Objection, by written agreement of Buyer and Sellers' Representative and/or by
determination of the Determining Party), (i) if the Closing Debt Amount
exceeds Adjusted Closing Cash, Sellers shall not be entitled to receive any
amount of Adjusted Closing Cash, (ii) if the Tangible Equity Amount is greater
than the Tangible Equity Target (any such excess, the "Excess Tangible Equity
Amount"), Buyer shall cause the Company to distribute to the Sellers, in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages, an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of Adjusted Closing Cash over the Closing Debt Amount in an
amount up to (but not greater than) the Excess Tangible Equity Amount, and
(iii) if the Tangible Equity Amount is less than the Tangible Equity Target by
more than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000), (A) each Seller
shall, in accordance with Section 2.7, cause to be paid to Buyer such Seller's
Pro Rata Percentage of such difference, including the first Two Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($250,000) thereof (the "Tangible Equity Adjustment") and (B)
Sellers shall not be entitled to receive any amount of Adjusted Closing Cash.



2.5 Section 338(h)(10) Election. Sellers and Buyer shall join in making an
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding
equivalent elections under state or local Law) (a "Section 338(h)(10)
Election") with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares to treat such
purchase and sale as a deemed sale of assets for U.S. federal income Tax and
state and/or franchise Tax purposes. Except as otherwise provided herein,
Sellers shall include in all relevant Tax calculations and filings any income,
gain, loss, deduction, or other Tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, including (a) any Tax imposed under Treasury Regulations Section
1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(2), or (b) any state or local Tax imposed. In connection
with the Section 338(h)(10) Election (or as soon thereafter as reasonably
practicable), the parties shall file all federal, state, local and other forms
necessary to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election 



jointly and shall make any required filings and take any and all other
reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to effect the Section 338(h)(10)
Election. Sellers shall include in Sellers' income Tax Returns for the taxable
period, which includes the Closing Date, any forms that are required to be so
included on account of the Section 338(h)(10) Election. Sellers and Buyer
shall cooperate fully, and in good faith, with each other in making the
Section 338(h)(10) Election.



2.6 Calculation of Tax Gross-Up Amount.



(a) The Purchase Price shall include an amount equal to the grossed up excess
Tax cost to Sellers (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any interest,
penalties and additions that may be imposed with respect to such amount other
than interest, penalties and additions imposed as a result of an act or
omission of Buyer) resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement being treated as a sale of assets
as opposed to a sale of stock for Tax purposes, as determined in the following
manner (the "Tax Gross-Up Amount"). The Tax Gross-Up Amount shall equal the
product of (x) and (y), with (x) equal to the quotient that results when (i)
the amount by which (A) the aggregate amount of U.S. federal, state, local and
any other Taxes incurred by Seller with respect to the disposition of its
Shares pursuant to this Agreement in the manner specified by the Section
338(h)(10) Election, including (1) any Tax imposed on Seller on amounts paid
by Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.6(a), (2) any Section 338(h)(10) Transfer
Tax and (3) any Taxes imposed on the Company resulting from the Section
338(h)(10) Election, exceeds (B) the aggregate amount of U.S. federal, state,
local and any other Taxes that would have been incurred by Seller with respect
to the disposition of its Shares pursuant to the Agreement, assuming that no
Section 338(h)(10) Election was made, is divided by (ii) the number of Shares
held by Seller (provided, however, that (1) the reference to "Seller" in the
foregoing calculation shall mean the Seller whose disposition of Shares
results in the highest quotient when the value of clause (i) for such Seller
is divided by the value of clause (ii) for such Seller in such calculation,
and (2)(AA) to determine whether Donald Maharam is treated as the Seller
described in the foregoing subsection (1), and if so, to determine the value
of this subsection (x), only Donald Maharam's directly owned Shares will be
taken into account in the calculation in this subsection (x) (and any Taxes
attributable to Shares held by the Article 3 Trust of Donald Maharam Annuity
Trust u/a/ dated June 15, 1999 shall be excluded), and (BB) to determine
whether the Article 3 Trust of Donald Maharam Annuity Trust u/a/ dated June
15, 1999 is treated as the Seller described in the foregoing subsection (1),
and, if so, to determine the value of this subsection (x), this subsection (x)
will be calculated only with respect to the Shares directly held by the
Article 3 Trust of Donald Maharam Annuity Trust u/a/ dated June 15, 1999) but
the term "Seller" shall include Donald Maharam solely for purposes of the
calculation in subsection (x)(i) (and any Taxes attributable to Shares held
directly by Donald Maharam shall be excluded)), and with (y) equal to the
total number of Shares. The parties agree that the intention of this Section
2.6(a) is to place the most adversely affected Seller in the same net after-
Tax position it would have been in had no Section 338(h)(10) Election been
made, while also providing each Seller with the same per share amount pursuant
to this Section 2.6(a), and the parties shall calculate the Tax Gross-Up
Amount consistent with that intention. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no positive tax attributes of Sellers that are
unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be taken
into account in the calculation of the Tax Gross-Up Amount.



(b) Buyer and Sellers' Representative agree that their mutual good faith
estimate of the Tax Gross-Up Amount is Five Million Five Hundred Sixty Five
Thousand Five Hundred Ninety-Three Dollars ($5,565,593) (the "Estimated Tax
Gross-Up Amount").



(c) Within sixty (60) days after the filing of all Tax Returns of Sellers for
the year in which the Closing occurs, but in any event not earlier than the
final determination of the Tangible Equity Amount (as described in Section
2.4(d)) and not later than December 15, 2014, Sellers' Representative shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer a written calculation (the "True-Up Calculation")
of the Tax Gross-Up Amount (the "Actual Tax Gross-Up Amount") and any Tax
Gross-Up Excess or any Tax Gross-Up Deficit. Buyer shall have access to all
relevant information of Sellers used in connection with the determination of
the Actual Tax Gross-Up Amount. Buyer shall, within thirty (30) days after
delivery by Sellers' Representative of the True‑Up Calculation, complete its
review of the True‑Up Calculation. If Buyer determines that the True-Up
Calculation has not been determined in accordance with this Section 2.6, or if
a disagreement between Sellers' Representative and Buyer remains unresolved
with respect to the True-Up Calculation, then in either case, Buyer shall
inform Sellers' Representative on or before the last day of such thirty (30)
day period by delivering a written notice to Buyer ("Notice of Tax Objection")
setting forth a specific and detailed description of the basis of Buyer's
objection and proposed good faith adjustments to the True-Up Calculation.
After receipt of the Notice of Tax Objection, Sellers' Representative shall
then have thirty (30) days to review and respond to the Notice of Tax
Objection. Sellers' Representative and its representatives shall have access
to all relevant information used in connection with the preparation of the
Notice of Tax Objection. Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall seek in good
faith to mutually resolve any differences which they may have with respect to
any matter specified in the Notice of Tax Objection. If Buyer does not
properly and timely deliver a Notice of Tax Objection, Buyer shall
conclusively be deemed to have accepted the True-Up Calculation. If any
disagreement between Buyer and Sellers' Representative with respect to the
determination of the Actual Tax Gross-Up Amount remains unresolved as of
thirty (30) days following Buyer's delivery of the Notice of Tax Objection,
then Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall refer the matter to the
Determining Party for resolution consistent with the process described in
Section 2.4(c) and, upon the final determination of the Actual Tax Gross-Up
Amount (by failure of Buyer to properly and timely deliver a Notice of Tax
Objection, written agreement of Buyer and Sellers' Representative and/or by
determination of the Determining Party): 



(i) if the Actual Tax Gross-Up Amount is more than the Estimated Tax Gross-Up
Amount (the "Tax Gross‑Up Excess"), Buyer shall pay each Seller its Pro Rata
Percentage of the Tax Gross‑Up Excess in accordance with Section 2.7; and



(ii) if the Actual Tax Gross-Up Amount is less than the Estimated Tax Gross-Up
Amount (the "Tax Gross‑Up Deficit"), each Seller shall pay Buyer its Pro Rata
Percentage of the Tax Gross‑Up Deficit in accordance with Section 2.7.



(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, after the
payment of the Tax Gross-Up Excess or the Tax Gross-Up Deficit, as applicable,
and except as otherwise provided in Section 7.9(c) and Section 7.9(e), the
Actual Tax Gross-Up Amount shall be final and binding on Buyer and Sellers.



(e) If the Section 338(h)(10) Election is invalid for any reason, upon
Buyer's request:



(i)each Seller shall pay Buyer the portion of its Pro Rata Percentage of the
Estimated Tax Gross-Up Amount, or Actual Tax Gross-Up Amount, as applicable,
actually received by such Seller from Buyer that relates to a Tax Liability
owed as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election and (x) that is not
reported by Seller on a Tax Return filed with a Governmental Authority or (y)
that Seller is not obligated to pay to a Governmental Authority; and



(ii)if the Tax Returns reporting the consequences of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election were filed by any Seller, such Seller shall file amended Tax Returns
claiming refunds of Taxes paid by such Seller as a result of the Section
338(h)(10) Election; provided, that this Section 2.6(e)(ii) shall only apply
if (x) the applicable Seller determines in its sole discretion that it will
not be adversely affected by filing such amended Tax Returns or (y) the
applicable Seller determines in its reasonable discretion that Buyer will
indemnify such Seller for any adverse Tax consequences of filing such amended
Tax Returns. Upon receipt of any refunds resulting from the filing of such
amended Tax Returns by any Seller, such Seller shall pay Buyer the portion of
such refunds attributable to Taxes that were taken into account in Buyer's
payment of such Seller's Pro Rata Portion of the Estimated Tax Gross-Up
Amount, or Actual Tax Gross-Up Amount, as applicable, net of any reasonable
costs or Taxes imposed as a result of the amendment of such Tax Returns.



If any Seller determines in its reasonable discretion that such Seller (x) has
any Liability to any Governmental Authority for any Tax cost that was or
should have been taken into account in determining the Tax Gross-Up Amount
pursuant to Section 2.6(a) or is otherwise liable for any such Tax cost and
(y) such Seller has made any payment to Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.6(e)
with respect to such Liability, Buyer shall repay such payment to such Seller
up to the amount of such Liability no later than ten (10) days after the date
on which such Seller notifies Buyer of such obligation.



2.7 Payment of Purchase Price Adjustments. Any amount payable pursuant to
Section 2.4(d) and/or Section 2.6(c) shall be paid by the applicable party or
parties within three (3) Business Days following the final determination of
the Tangible Equity Amount or the Actual Tax Gross-Up Amount, as applicable.
Any payment made pursuant to Sections 2.4, 2.6 or this 2.7 shall be deemed to
be an adjustment to the Purchase Price.



2.8 Payment Terms. All payments made pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents shall be made in United States Dollars and all
references herein to any amounts shall be deemed to be denominated in United
States Dollars. All payments made pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account or accounts specified in writing by the payee at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the payment date.



2.9 Purchase Price Allocation. The Purchase Price and the Liabilities of the
Company (plus other relevant items, including any amount treated as having
been paid for the Company's assets under Code Section 338) as of Closing shall
be allocated among the assets of the Company for all purposes (including Tax,
financial and accounting) in accordance with Code Section 338 and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder; provided, however, that any and all amount(s)
representing Third Party Closing Payments shall not be double-counted (i.e.,
to the extent allowable under applicable Law, Third Party Closing Payments
shall be included in Purchase Price or in Liabilities, but not both) in making
such allocation. Such allocation is set forth on Exhibit C and shall be
adjusted after the Closing by Buyer, at the sole cost and expense of Buyer, to
the extent necessary to reflect any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant
to Section 2.4, Section 2.6 or Section 2.7. Each of Buyer, Sellers and the
Company shall prepare and file IRS Form 8883 (and any applicable forms
required under state or local Law) and supplementary forms in respect of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election in a timely manner consistent with such
allocation, and shall file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and
claims for refund) and information reports in a manner consistent with such
allocation. Sellers and Buyer shall each provide the other with a copy of the
IRS Form 8883 it files and any corresponding forms required under state or
local Law.



2.10 Closing; Closing Date. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be consummated (the "Closing") at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, by a so-
called "virtual closing" pursuant to which all Closing deliveries may be
effected by telephone, facsimile, email, PDF, wire transfer and/or similar
means, on the later of April 29, 2013 or the date that is three (3) Business
Days after the satisfaction

actually occurs being the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be deemed to be

5.3 Third Party Claim Procedures. Subject to the provisions set forth below,
the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its own expense, to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim, and if said right is
exercised, the parties shall cooperate in the investigation and defense of
said Third Party Claim. The following provisions shall apply to any Third
Party Claim:



(a) The Indemnified Party will give the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice of any Third Party Claim; provided, however, that a delay in giving
such notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party only to the extent the
Indemnifying Party suffers irreparable prejudice from or as a result of such a
delay. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to undertake the defense
thereof by representatives chosen by it. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes
the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to defend any such Third Party Claim actively
and in good faith to its conclusion, and the Indemnified Party shall not
settle or agree to an adjudication of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified
Party shall make fully available to the Indemnifying Party and its
representatives on a timely basis (subject to the Indemnifying Party executing
a reasonable confidentiality agreement) all records and other materials
required or requested by them and in the possession or under the control of
the Indemnified Party, for the use of the Indemnifying Party and its
representatives in defending any such Third Party Claim, and shall in all
other respects give full and prompt cooperation and assistance in such
defense.



(b) If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend a Third Party Claim in
accordance with Section 5.3(a), the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate, at its own expense and with its own counsel, in the defense of
such Third Party Claim, and to the extent reasonably requested by the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall consult with the Indemnified
Party from time to time on all material matters relating to the defense of
such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall promptly provide the
Indemnified Party with copies of all pleadings and material correspondence
relating to such Third Party Claim.



(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not (i) be
entitled to control the defense of a Third Party Claim (A) if the Third Party
Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation; (B) if the Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party and no monetary
damages are sought in connection with such Third Party Claim, or (C) if the
Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest
exists between the parties (other than Third Party Claims relating to Taxes),
(ii) be entitled to settle any Third Party Claim without the consent of the
Indemnified Party if such settlement imposes any restriction or Liability on
the Indemnified Party other than the payment of money, for which the
Indemnifying Party will be responsible and will pay in full on the date of
settlement, and for which the Indemnified Party shall have no Liability, and
(iii) with respect to Third Party Claims with respect to Taxes for which
Sellers are the Indemnifying Party, Buyer shall not enter into any settlement
of, or otherwise compromise, any such Third Party Claim that would adversely
affect Sellers without the prior written consent of Sellers, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



(d) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in the event of a claim by a
Buyer Indemnified Party that it is entitled to indemnification from Sellers,
including with respect to a Third Party Claim or pursuant to Section 5.1(a) or
(b), all elections and other decisions to be made by Sellers with respect to a
Third Party Claim shall be made by Sellers' Representative. 





5.4 Direct Claims Procedure. The following exclusive procedure shall govern
any and all indemnification claims against an Indemnifying Party which may be
brought pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement:



(a) The Indemnified Party shall give written notice to the Indemnifying Party
of all claims, other than Third Party Claims (the procedure for which is set
forth in Section 5.3) and Section 338(h)(10) Controversy (the procedure for
which is set forth in Section 7.9(e)), that could constitute a claim for
indemnification under this Article V promptly upon becoming aware of such
claim; provided, however, that a delay in giving such notice shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party only to the extent the Indemnifying Party suffers
irreparable prejudice from or as a result of such a delay. The written notice
shall specify, to the extent known by the Indemnified Party, (i) the factual
basis for such claim and, if applicable, the specific alleged violation of
this Agreement; (ii) the dollar amount of the claim and the basis therefor;
and (iii) copies of any underlying correspondence or communications from a
third party or otherwise with respect to the foundation of such claim.



(b) With respect to indemnification claims other than Third Party Claims (the
procedure for which is set forth in Section 5.3) and Section 338(h)(10)
Controversy (the procedure for which is set forth in Section 7.9(e)),
following receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of a claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days to make such investigation of
the claim as the Indemnifying Party deems necessary or desirable. For the
purposes of such investigation, the Indemnified Party shall fully and timely
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party agrees
(subject to the Indemnifying Party executing a reasonable confidentiality
agreement) to make fully and timely available to the Indemnifying Party and/or
its authorized representatives the information relied upon by the Indemnified
Party to substantiate the claim, as well as any other information bearing
thereon reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party agree at or prior to the expiration of such
thirty (30)-day investigation period (or any mutually agreed upon extension
thereof) ("Investigation Period") to the validity and amount of such claim,
then the Indemnifying Party shall immediately pay, or cause to be paid (from
the Indemnification Escrow or otherwise), to the Indemnified Party the full
amount of the claim, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.5. If
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party do not mutually agree on the
validity and amount of such Claim at or prior to the expiration of such
Investigation Period, then the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall arbitrate such dispute pursuant to Section 10.13.



5.5 Limitations on Indemnity. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement:



(a) The representations and warranties contained in Articles III and IV of
this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date for a period of eighteen (18)
months (the "Claim Period"), after which they shall expire and be of no
effect; provided, however, that the representations and warranties contained
in the first sentence of Section 3.1 (Organization), Section 3.3 (Enforceable
Agreement), Section 3.5 (Good Title to Shares), Section 3.6 (Capitalization),
Section 4.1 (Organization of Buyer) and Section 4.2 (Authority) (the
"Fundamental Representations"), shall survive indefinitely and not expire, and
the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.14 (Taxes) and
Section 3.28 (Specific Tax Matters) shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations. Any claim for indemnification under this
Agreement based upon a breach of or an inaccuracy in a representation or
warranty (other than a breach of or an inaccuracy in a Fundamental
Representation or involving actual and intentional fraud) may only be made on
or before the expiration of the Claim Period or the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (with respect to breaches or inaccuracies of
Section 3.14 and Section 3.28).

(b) Sellers shall not have any liability for indemnification under Section
5.1(a)(i) or Section 5.1(c) until the aggregate amount of all of the Buyer
Indemnified Losses that are Qualifying Losses incurred by Buyer Indemnified
Parties which are subject to indemnification under Section 5.1(a)(i) and
Section 5.1(c) exceeds Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000) (the
"Basket Amount"), at which time Sellers shall (subject to the other
limitations set forth in this Article V) be liable for all Buyer Indemnified
Losses that are Qualifying Losses, including the Basket Amount. The limitation
set forth in this Section 5.5(b) shall not apply with respect to an
indemnification claim based upon a breach of or an inaccuracy in a Fundamental
Representation or involving actual and intentional fraud.



(c) Buyer shall not have any liability for indemnification under Section
5.2(a) until the aggregate amount of all Seller Indemnified Losses that are
Qualifying Losses incurred by Seller Indemnified Parties exceeds the Basket
Amount, at which time Buyer shall (subject to the other limitations set forth
in this Article V) be liable for all Seller Indemnified Losses that are
Qualifying Losses, including the Basket Amount. The limitation set forth in
this Section 5.5(c) shall not apply with respect to an indemnification claim
based upon a breach of or an inaccuracy in a Fundamental Representation or
involving actual and intentional fraud.



(d) Sellers shall not have any liability for indemnification under Section
5.1(a)(i), Section 5.1(c), Section 5.1(d), or Section 5.1(e) once the
aggregate amount of the Buyer Indemnified Losses actually indemnified by
Sellers exceeds Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) (the "Cap Amount"). The
limitation set forth in this Section 5.5(d) shall not apply with respect to an
indemnification claim based upon a breach of or an inaccuracy in a Fundamental
Representation or involving actual and intentional fraud. 



(e) Buyer shall not have any liability for indemnification under Section
5.2(a) once the aggregate amount of Seller Indemnified Losses actually
indemnified by Buyer exceeds the Cap Amount. The limitation set forth in this
Section 5.5(e) shall not apply with respect to an indemnification claim based
upon a breach of or an inaccuracy in a Fundamental Representation or involving
actual and intentional fraud.



(f) If the same claim for indemnification may be brought as a result of a
breach of more than one representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may choose the representation or warranty
under which to pursue the indemnification claim, and the fact that such
indemnification claim may be limited or barred if brought pursuant to a breach
of one particular representation or warranty contained in this Agreement shall
not impact or limit an Indemnified Party's ability to bring the same claim for
breach of another representation or warranty to which such limitation does not
apply. In addition, the limitations set forth in this Section 5.5 do not limit
the obligation of any party to indemnify the other party from and against any
claim arising from any breach of a covenant, even if such breach also
constitutes a breach of a representation or warranty; provided, that in no
event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to double recovery under this
Agreement (in particular, in the event any circumstances giving rise to a Loss
constitute a breach of more than one representation and warranty or covenant
on the part of any Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall only be
entitled to be indemnified once in respect of such Loss).



(g) For purposes of (i) calculating the amount of any Losses incurred in
connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
set forth in this Agreement and (ii) determining whether any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation or warranty of any Seller or the Company
contained in Section 3.14(a), Section 3.14(b) or Section 3.17(d) has occurred
for purposes of Section 5.1(a)(i), any and all references to "material" or
"material adverse effect" or "MAC" (or other correlative or similar terms or
qualifiers) shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, shall only
be liable for any individual Loss or group of related Losses in excess of
Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) ("Qualifying Losses"); provided,
however, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any Losses under
Section 5.1(f).



5.6 Net Loss. In computing the amount of any Buyer Indemnified Loss or any
Seller Indemnified Loss, such Buyer Indemnified Loss or Seller Indemnified
Loss shall be deemed to be net of (i) any specific accruals or reserves in the
Financial Information and any insurance proceeds, indemnity, contribution or
other similar payment paid by a third party and actually received with respect
thereto and (ii) any net Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnified
Party before the payment of the indemnification claim. In addition, to the
extent not taken into account in the foregoing subsection (ii), Buyer shall
pay to Sellers the amount of any net cash Tax benefit (including a reduction
of Taxes or a credit arising from the overpayment of Taxes against Taxes due
and payable) that is actually realized by Buyer or the Company and that arises
with respect to a Buyer Indemnified Loss for which a payment is made pursuant
to Section 5.1.



5.7 Exclusive Remedy. The indemnification provisions of this Article V
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties with respect to any
and all claims relating to this Agreement; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not (a) apply to or in any way limit a party's rights with
respect to any claim involving actual and intentional fraud or (b) limit a
party's ability to pursue and obtain specific performance, injunctive relief
or equitable relief.



5.8 Indemnification Escrow. As promptly as practicable following (a) the
agreement of Buyer and Sellers' Representative with respect to the amount of
any Buyer Indemnified Losses or (b) the binding determination of the amount of
any Buyer Indemnified Losses in accordance with Section 10.13, as applicable,
Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent a joint written instruction instructing the Escrow Agent to release to
the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party from the Indemnification Escrow the
full amount of such Buyer Indemnified Losses; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a written demand or claim
against a Buyer Indemnified Party by any holder of an Affiliate Guarantee,
such Buyer Indemnified Party shall promptly notify Sellers' Representative of
such demand or claim and, unless such demand or claim is fully resolved with
no further Liability to such Buyer Indemnified Party within ten (10) Business
Days after the delivery of such notice to Sellers' Representative, Sellers'
Representative and Buyer shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint
written instruction instructing the Escrow Agent to release to such holder of
the applicable Affiliate Guarantee from the Indemnification Escrow the full
amount of such demand or claim in satisfaction of such demand or claim. The
Indemnification Escrow is not a cap or limit on the Buyer Indemnified Parties'
indemnifiable Losses hereunder, and to the extent such Losses exceed the
amount of the Indemnification Escrow, Sellers shall then be directly
responsible and liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for such Losses.

Liability to the Company, Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction instructing the Escrow
Agent to release to the holder of any such Affiliate Guarantee and/or

related to the operation of the Business. The Advisory Committee initially

(or cause to be prepared) any income Tax Return (including Schedule K-1 or
similar schedule under state law) for United States federal Taxes and each
other jurisdiction (i) in which the Company is required to file income Tax
Returns and (ii) (x) under the Laws of which the taxable year of the Company
is required or permitted to be closed as of the Closing Date as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Short Period Returns")
or (y) which relate to taxable periods that end on or prior to the Closing
Date. Each Short Period Return shall cover the Taxable period commencing on
the day after the last day covered by a prior Tax Return filed by the Company
prior to the Closing, or a prior Tax Return to be filed by the Company as
prepared by the Sellers' Representative pursuant to this Section 7.9(a) (other
than a Short Period Return), with respect to such Tax and ending on the
Closing Date and the relevant Taxes and Tax Liability relating to Short Period
Returns shall be determined from the books and records of the Company at the
close of business on the Closing Date; provided, however, that, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, (a) extraordinary transactions (other than the
payment of any payment specified in Schedule 3.28, including any such payment
triggered in whole or in part as a result of the consummation of any such
transaction ("Specified Closing Payments")) occurring on the Closing Date and
after the Closing shall be allocated to the Taxable period that is deemed to
begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date and (b) Taxes and
other items, exemptions, allowances, and deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be
allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period
commencing after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each
such period. To the extent allowed by applicable law, the Specified Closing
Payments shall be allocated to Taxable periods prior to the Closing and Seller
shall be entitled to apply, to the extent usable, all related Tax deductions
and other Tax benefits related to the Specified Closing Payments against
Taxable income in respect of Taxable periods prior to the Closing.



(b) Buyer shall have the right to review each Short Period Return. To
facilitate this right, Sellers' Representative shall deliver a complete copy
of each Short Period Return as soon as practicable following completion of its
preparation. Buyer must, within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of the
applicable Short Period Return, deliver to Sellers\' Representative a notice
of objection specifying in reasonable detail any objections it may have to
such Short Period Return, provided Buyer may object to such Short Period
Return only if Buyer determined in good faith that the treatment of one or
more items on such Short Period Return does not have sufficient legal or
factual support to avoid the imposition of penalties, fines or similar
amounts. If Buyer does not timely deliver such a notice of 



objection, Buyer and the Company shall be deemed to have accepted and approved
the Short Period Return and to have waived any objections to the Short Period
Return. If Buyer properly delivers a notice of objection to the Short Period
Return, then Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall resolve such dispute in
accordance with the dispute resolution mechanism set forth in Section 2.4(c).



(c) Upon the final determination of any Short Period Return (by the failure of
Buyer to properly deliver a notice of objection, by written agreement of Buyer
and Sellers' Representative and/or by determination of the Determining Party),
(i) Buyer shall cause the Company Group to (A) deliver to each Seller a
Schedule K-1 (or equivalent under state law) for the Short Period Return, if
any, and (B) file the Short Period Return, and (ii) Sellers shall pay when due
in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages all amounts shown as
due on the Short Period Return. If any adjustment to a Short Period Return
would have increased the Tax Gross-Up Amount calculated at the time of the
adjustment, Buyer shall pay such increase to Sellers in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Percentages within ten (10) days after Sellers file the
applicable Short Period Return. If any adjustment to a Short Period Return
would have decreased the Tax Gross-Up Amount calculated at the time of the
adjustment, Sellers shall pay in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Percentages such decrease to Buyer within ten (10) days after Sellers file the
applicable Short Period Return.



(d) Without prior written notice to Sellers' Representative, Buyer will not
cause any member of the Company Group to (i) amend any Tax Return relating to
any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or
(ii) carryback any item to a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date.
At Sellers' Representative\'s cost and expense, Buyer shall cause any member
of the Company Group to amend any Tax Returns for periods ending on or before
the Closing Date ("Amended Tax Returns"), if (i) Sellers' Representative
provides written notification to Buyer of the desire to file an Amended Tax
Return as soon as practicable before the anticipated filing date and in any
event not less than a reasonable amount of time before such date, (ii)
Sellers' Representative shall submit any Amended Tax Return to Buyer for its
review and filing in a form suitable for immediate filing by the Company Group
together with all schedules, supplemental forms and other attachments required
for such Tax Returns, and (iii) such Tax Return is signed by a Certified
Public Accountant selected by Sellers' Representative, and approved by Buyer
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), with
reasonable care as a paid preparer. Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer
or any member of the Company Group, and any amounts credited against any Tax
of Buyer or the Company Group, in each case, that do not relate to deductions
or credits arising with respect to amounts economically borne by Buyer, to
which Buyer or a member of the Company Group become entitled that relate to
any Tax period of a member of the Company Group (or portion thereof) ending on
or prior to the Closing Date, will be for the account of Sellers. Buyer will
pay, or cause to be paid, over to Sellers any such refunds or amounts of any
such credit, net of reasonable fees or expenses incurred by Buyer or the
Company or any member of the Company Group in obtaining such refund or credit,
within five (5) Business Days after receipt or entitlement thereto.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 7.9(d) to the contrary, Buyer
shall not be obligated to pay any refund or other amount under this Section
7.9(d) to the extent that any such refund or other amounts are the result of
the carrying back of any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax
credit incurred in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date. To the extent a refund or credit against Taxes that gave rise to
a payment hereunder is subsequently disallowed or otherwise reduced, Sellers
shall pay to Buyer the amount of such disallowed or reduced refund or credit
against Taxes.

shall sign and date IRS Form 8023 or a signature schedule attached thereto,
shall provide their taxpayer identification numbers, shall sign any
corresponding state or local forms required in connection with a Section
338(h)(10) Election, and shall provide any other information required by Form
8023 and any corresponding state or local form. All such forms to be signed
shall be prepared by Buyer and shall be in form reasonably acceptable to
Sellers. Buyer shall retain and promptly file the executed IRS Form 8023 and
corresponding state and local forms and shall provide to Sellers'
Representative a copy of each such form. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall indemnify Sellers for any reasonable
out of pocket expenses incurred by Sellers or Sellers' Representative after
the Closing Date in connection with (i) their preparation of any forms,
schedules or similar documentation required pursuant to Section 2.5, Section
2.6 or this Section 7.9(e), and (ii) any other matter, inquiry, claim,
dispute, controversy, litigation or similar event in connection with a Section
338(h)(10) Election, including Section 338(h)(10) Controversies. Sellers'
Representative shall have the authority to represent the interest of each
member of the Company Group with respect to any Individual Section 338(h)(10)
Controversy, and the applicable Seller or Sellers shall have the authority to
represent its or their, as applicable, interest in such Individual Section
338(h)(10) Controversy; provided, however, that Sellers' Representative and
the applicable Seller or Sellers shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of such
Individual Section 338(h)(10) Controversy and shall allow Buyer to make
comments to Sellers' Representative regarding the conduct of or positions
taken by any member of the Company Group in any such Individual Section
338(h)(10) Controversy; provided, further, that Sellers' Representative shall
not consent to any settlement of such Individual Section 338(h)(10)
Controversy without the prior written consent of Buyer, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. With respect to all Section
338(h)(10) Controversies other than Individual Section 338(h)(10)
Controversies, Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall jointly represent the
interest of each member of the Company Group; provided, however, that neither
Sellers' Representative nor Buyer shall settle any Section 338(h)(10)
Controversy (other than an Individual Section 338(h)(10) Controversy), without
the other party's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If any adjustments resulting from a Section
338(h)(10) Controversy would have increased the Tax Gross-Up Amount calculated
at the time of the adjustment, Buyer shall pay such increase to Sellers in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages within ten (10) days
after the settlement of such Section 338(h)(10) Controversy. If any
adjustments resulting from a Section 338(h)(10) 



Controversy would have decreased the Tax Gross-Up Amount calculated at the
time of the adjustment, Sellers shall pay in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Percentages such decrease to Buyer within ten (10) days after the
settlement of such Section 338(h)(10) Controversy.



7.10 Tax Controversies.



(a) Buyer shall promptly notify Sellers upon receipt by Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer (including each member of the Company Group after the Closing) of
written notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events
with respect to Taxes relating to a taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date for which Sellers may be liable under this Agreement (any such
inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, other than any Section
338(h)(10) Controversy, a "Tax Matter"). Sellers' Representative, at Sellers'
sole expense, shall have the authority to represent the interests of each
member of the Company Group with respect to any Tax Matter before the IRS, any
other taxing authority, any other governmental agency or authority or any
court and shall have the right to control the defense, compromise or other
resolution of any Tax Matter, including responding to inquiries, filing Tax
Returns and contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for
additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of,
or relating to, a Tax Matter; provided, however, that Sellers' Representative
shall not enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any Tax Matter
that adversely affects the Tax Liability of Buyer, the Company or any member
of the Company Group or any affiliate of the foregoing for any period ending
after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. Sellers'
Representative shall keep Buyer fully and timely informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of any Tax Matter. Sellers' Representative
shall, in good faith, allow Buyer to make comments to Sellers' Representative,
regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such proceeding.

provided in Section 7.10(a), Buyer shall have the exclusive authority to
control such Tax Matter. Buyer shall not enter into any settlement of, or
otherwise compromise, any such Tax Matter that would adversely affect Sellers
without the prior written consent of Sellers' Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.

requested information. Buyer and Sellers agree, and Buyer agrees to cause the
Company Group, (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company Group relating to any pre-Closing period until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer
or Sellers' Representative, any extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Taxing authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if the other party so requests, allow the other party to take possession
of such books and records.



(b) Buyer and Sellers further agree, upon written request, to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but
not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

earlier of (i) the termination of Michael Maharam's employment with the

four (24) months after the Closing Date, Arvid receives an offer for the

other transactions in the Ordinary Course of Business, then (a) Sellers shall
cause Arvid to promptly notify in writing Buyer of the terms of such offer and

controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a
"Dispute") shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in

to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Neither party may assign, whether voluntarily or by operation of Law,
or delegate this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other

void and of no effect.

reviewed, negotiated and adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and
understanding of the parties, and the language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties thereto to express their
mutual intent.



10.16 Sellers' Representative. By their execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Michael
Maharam and Stephen Maharam, acting jointly (except in the case either Michael
Maharam or Stephen Maharam becomes incapacitated, in which case the other
shall act alone, and Buyer may rely on the certification of the non-
incapacitated individual as to the incapacity of the other), as each such
Person's true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact (hereinafter,
collectively, "Sellers' Representative"), with full and complete power and
authority in its name and on its behalf: (a) to act on behalf of such Person
for any and all purposes according to the terms of this Agreement, including
the power to amend this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.9; (b) to give
and receive notices and make any and all decisions under Sections 2.4 and 2.6
on behalf of Sellers; (c) to give and receive notices and to provide consents
hereunder; and (d) in general, to do any and all things and to perform any and
all acts under or pursuant to this Agreement, including executing and
delivering all ancillary instruments referenced herein or contemplated hereby
in each case above, all in the absolute discretion of Sellers' Representative;
and Michael Maharam and Stephen Maharam hereby accept such appointment.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, any actions required or
permitted to be taken under this Agreement and any ancillary instruments
referenced herein or contemplated hereby by Sellers may be taken by Sellers'
Representative on behalf of all of Sellers (including by Sellers'
Representative, in their own individual capacity as Sellers). This power of
attorney, and all authority hereby conferred, is granted subject to the
interests of the other Sellers, the Company and Buyer hereunder and in
consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements made herein, and shall be
irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any Seller or by
operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of any Seller or by the
occurrence of any other event. Sellers' Representative shall not be liable to
Buyer, any member of the Company Group or any other Seller for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Sellers' Representative, except in the case of actual and
intentional fraud on the part of Sellers' Representative. Sellers'
Representative shall be entitled to receive reimbursement from, and be
indemnified by, Sellers for certain expenses, charges and Liabilities as
provided below. In connection with this Agreement, and in exercising or
failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon Sellers'
Representative hereunder, (i) Sellers' Representative shall incur no
responsibility whatsoever to any Seller by reason of any error in judgment or
other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder, excepting only
responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents actual and
intentional fraud, and (ii) Sellers' Representative shall be entitled to rely
on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts
experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or
omission of Sellers' Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no event
subject Sellers' Representative to liability to any Seller. Each Seller shall
indemnify, severally and not jointly, based on such Seller's Pro Rata
Percentage, Sellers' Representative against all Losses, damages, Liabilities,
claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys',
accountants' and other experts' fees and the amount of any judgment against
them, of any nature whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any and all
expenses whatsoever, reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or
defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claims
whatsoever), arising out of or in connection with any claim, investigation, 



action or in connection with any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or
omissions of Sellers' Representative hereunder. The foregoing indemnification
shall not apply in the event of any action or proceeding that finally
adjudicates the liability of Sellers' Representative hereunder with respect to
any actual and intentional fraud. Sellers' Representative may arrange to
receive reimbursement and indemnification directly from Sellers for such
amounts. If not paid directly to Sellers' Representative by Sellers, such
amounts may be recovered by Sellers' Representative from any portion of the
Escrow Deposit otherwise distributable to Sellers in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement, and such recovery will be made from Sellers according to
their respective Pro Rata Percentages. All of the indemnities, immunities and
powers granted to Sellers' Representative under this Agreement shall survive
the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement. The grant of authority
provided for herein is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and
survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Seller, and
any action taken by Sellers' Representative pursuant to the authority granted
in this Agreement shall be effective and absolutely binding on each Seller
notwithstanding any contrary action of or direction from such Seller, except
for actions or omissions of Sellers' Representative constituting actual and
intentional fraud.



10.17 Specific Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
or threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages would be
inadequate in such event. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the parties
shall be entitled to equitable relief, without proof of actual damages,
including an injunction or injunctions or orders for specific performance to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including any order sought by the Company and/or
Sellers' Representative to cause Buyer to perform its agreements and covenants
contained in this Agreement), in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity as a remedy for any such breach or threatened
breach. Each party further agrees that no other party hereto or any other
Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this Section 10.17, and each party hereto (a) irrevocably
waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or similar instrument and (b) agrees to cooperate fully in
any attempt by the other party or parties in obtaining such equitable relief.
Each party further agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise
in response to any action for equitable relief is that it contests the
existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.



10.18 Mutual Release.

(a) Except for any claim based on fraud and subject to Section 10.18(c),
effective as of the Closing Date, (i) the Company, on behalf of itself and its
officers, directors, employees, members, managers and subsidiaries, and each
of their respective successors and assigns, hereby releases, acquits and
forever discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each Seller and
their respective beneficiaries, agents, heirs, executors, trustees, successors
and assigns of, from and against any and all actions, causes of action,
claims, demands, damages, judgments, debts, dues and suits of every kind,
nature and description whatsoever, which the Company, or its successors or
assigns, ever had, now has or may have, in each case solely in connection with
the ownership or operation of the Company prior to the Closing, and (ii) each
Seller, on behalf of itself and its respective beneficiaries, agents, heirs,
executors, trustees, successors and assigns, hereby releases, acquits and
forever discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Company, from
and against any and all actions, causes of action, claims, demands, damages,
judgments, debts, dues and suits of every kind, nature and description
whatsoever, which any Seller, or its trustees, beneficiaries, agents, heirs,
executors, trustees, successors or assigns, ever had, now has or may have, in
each case based upon any fact or action occurring or arising prior to the
Closing.

(b) Subject to Section 10.18(c), the Company agrees not to, and agrees to
cause its respective officers, directors, employees, members, managers and
subsidiaries, and each of their respective successors and assigns, not to,
assert any such released claim against the Sellers. Subject to Section
10.18(c), each Seller agrees not to, and agrees to cause its respective
trustees, beneficiaries, agents, heirs, executors, trustees, successors and
assigns, not to, assert any such released claim against the Company.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Buyer nor the Company, on the one
hand, nor any of the Sellers, on the other hand, release and each of them
retain, their respective rights and interests under the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality
Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 10.18 shall in any way limit or
impair any of the rights of the parties under this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents or the Confidentiality Agreement.
