AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the " _Agreement_ ") is made and
entered into as of October 21, 2016, between ACCESS NATIONAL CORPORATION, a
Virginia corporation (" _Access_ "), and MIDDLEBURG FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a
Virginia corporation (" _Middleburg_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Access and Middleburg have approved, and
deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders
to consummate, the business combination transaction provided for herein in
which Middleburg will merge with and into Access (the " _Merger_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Access and Middleburg have each
determined that the Merger is consistent with and will further their
respective business strategies and goals; and

  



  

WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that, for federal income tax
purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), and that this Agreement shall constitute, and is adopted as, a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

Article 1 
  
 The merger and related matters

  



  

Section 1.1 The Merger.

  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Date
(as defined in Section 1.2) and in accordance with the Virginia Stock
Corporation Act (the " _VSCA_ "), Middleburg will be merged with and into
Access pursuant to the Plan of Merger, substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit 1.1_ and made a part hereof (the " _Plan of Merger_ ").
The separate corporate existence of Middleburg thereupon shall cease, and
Access will be the surviving corporation in the Merger (Access is referred to
herein as the " _Continuing Corporation_ " whenever reference is made to it as
of the Effective Date or thereafter). The Merger will have the effect set
forth in Section 13.1-721 of the VSCA. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from and after the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation shall
possess all rights, privileges, properties, immunities, powers and franchises
of Middleburg, and all of the debts, liabilities, obligations, claims,
restrictions and duties of Middleburg shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, claims, restrictions and duties of the Continuing Corporation.

  



  

Section 1.2 Effective Date.

  



  

The Merger will become effective on the date and at the time shown on the
Certificate of Merger issued by the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the
" _SCC_ ") effecting the Merger (the " _Effective Date_ "). At or after the
Closing Date (as defined herein), Access and Middleburg will execute and
deliver Articles of Merger meeting the requirements of Section 13.1-720 of the
VSCA, including containing the Plan of Merger, to the SCC.

parties (the " _Closing Date_ "). All documents required by this Agreement to
be delivered at or prior to the Closing Date will be exchanged by the parties

(c) _Distributions to Holders of Middleburg Common Stock_. Upon the
Effective Date, each holder of an outstanding share of Middleburg Common
Stock who has properly surrendered such Certificates (as defined herein) or
non-certificated shares represented by book-entry registry of Middleburg
Common Stock (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") to the Exchange Agent (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates) will be entitled to evidence
of issuance in book entry form the number of whole shares of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock (except if such holder has made an election to
receive a physical stock certificate pursuant to Section 2.2(d) of this
Agreement) and the amount of cash, if any, into which the aggregate number of
shares of Middleburg Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement. If a holder of Middleburg Common Stock surrenders such
Certificates representing shares of Middleburg Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") or Book-Entry Shares and a properly executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent at least five (5) business days prior to
the Effective Date, then Access shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Exchange Agent to deliver, within two (2) business days following
the Effective Date, to such holder of Middleburg Common Stock the
consideration into which the shares of such Middleburg Common Stock have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement. If a holder of Middleburg Common Stock
surrenders such Certificates or Book Entry Shares and a properly executed
letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent at any time after five (5)
business days prior to the Effective Date, then Access shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to promptly, but in no event
later than five (5) business days following receipt of such Certificates or
Book Entry Shares and a properly executed letter of transmittal, deliver to
such holder of Middleburg Common Stock the consideration into which
the shares of such Middleburg Common Stock have been converted pursuant to
this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to deliver the
consideration to which any former holder of Middleburg Common Stock is
entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders his or her
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for exchange as provided in this Section
2.2. The Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be, as
applicable, duly endorsed or accompanied with such transfer and other
documentation as the Exchange Agent may require. Any other provision of this
Agreement notwithstanding, neither the Continuing Corporation nor the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to a holder of the Middleburg Common Stock for
any amounts paid or property delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law.

(d) _Letter of Transmittal_. Access shall take all steps necessary
to cause the Exchange Agent, within five (5) business days after
the Effective Date, to mail to each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares who has not previously surrendered such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares a form letter of transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration into which the shares of such
Middleburg Common Stock have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Such
letter of transmittal shall permit each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares to elect to receive, in lieu of shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock represented by book-entry registry, a physical stock certificate
representing shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to
this Article 2.

  



  

(e) _Lost Certificates_. A holder of Middleburg Common Stock whose
Certificates have been lost, destroyed, stolen or are otherwise missing shall
be entitled to receive its portion of the Merger Consideration and dividends
or distributions to which such shareholder shall be entitled upon compliance
with reasonable conditions imposed by the Continuing Corporation and the
Exchange Agent pursuant to applicable law and as required in accordance with
the Continuing Corporation's and the Exchange Agent's standard policy
(including the requirement that the shareholder furnish an affidavit of lost
certificate, surety bond or other customary indemnity).

  



  

Section 2.3 Rights of Former Holders of Middleburg Common Stock.

  



  

At the Effective Date, the stock transfer books of Middleburg shall be closed
as to holders of Middleburg Common Stock, and no transfer of Middleburg Common
Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until
surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2 of
this Agreement, each Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall from and after the
Effective Date represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor. To the
extent permitted by law, former holders of record of Middleburg Common Stock
shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Date at any meeting
of Continuing Corporation shareholders the number of whole shares of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which their respective shares of
Middleburg Common Stock are converted, regardless of whether such holders have
surrendered their Book-Entry Shares or Certificates for exchange as provided
in Section 2.2 of this Agreement. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is
declared by the Continuing Corporation on the Continuing Corporation Common
Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Date, the
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares
issuable pursuant to this Agreement, but no dividend or other distribution
payable to the holders of record of Middleburg Common Stock as of any time
subsequent to the Effective Date shall be delivered to the holder of any
Book-Entry Share or Certificate issued and outstanding at the Effective Date
until such holder surrenders such Book-Entry Share or Certificate for
exchange as provided in Section 2.2 of this Agreement. However, upon
surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate representing Middleburg
Common Stock the Merger Consideration, together with all such undelivered
dividends or other distributions without interest, shall be delivered and paid
with respect to each Book-Entry Share or other share represented by such
Certificate.

Section 2.4 Middleburg Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Date, each option to purchase shares of
Middleburg Common Stock (a " _Middleburg Stock Option_ ") granted under an
equity or equity-based compensation plan of Middleburg (a " _Middleburg Stock
Plan_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Date shall cease, at the Effective Date,
to represent a right to acquire Middleburg Common Stock and shall be converted
at the Effective Date, without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of
(i) the difference between the closing sale price of Middleburg Common Stock
on the NASDAQ Global Market on the trading day immediately preceding the
Effective Date and the per share exercise price of the Middleburg Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Date, and (ii) the number of shares of
Middleburg Common Stock subject to such Middleburg Stock Option, subject to
any applicable withholdings. If the exercise price of a Middleburg Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Date is greater than the closing
sale price of Middleburg Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on the
trading day immediately preceding the Effective Date, then at the Effective
Date such option shall be cancelled without any payment made in exchange
therefor. Prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg shall take all commercially
reasonable actions to give effect to this Section 2.4(a) including, without
limitation, using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a written consent
from each holder of a Middleburg Stock Option to the cancellation of such
Middleburg Stock Option in exchange for the cash payment provided by this
Section 2.4(a).

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg shall take all actions
necessary to cause each Middleburg Stock Plan to terminate immediately prior
to the Effective Date.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Date, each restricted stock award granted under
a Middleburg Stock Plan (a " _Middleburg Stock Award_ ") which is unvested or
contingent and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date, shall
fully vest and shall be converted into the right to receive, without
interest, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement, and the
shares of Middleburg Common Stock subject to such Middleburg Stock Award will
be treated in the same manner as all other shares of Middleburg Common Stock
for such purposes.

  



  

Section 2.5 No Fractional Shares.

  



  

Each holder of shares of Middleburg Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the
Merger which would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock
multiplied by the closing sale price of Access Common Stock on the NASDAQ
Global Market for the trading day immediately preceding (but not including)
the Effective Date.

  



  

Section 2.6 Treasury Warrant.

  



  

At the Effective Date, each Treasury Warrant (as defined herein), which is
then outstanding and unexercised shall cease to represent a right to acquire
Middleburg Common Stock and shall be converted into a warrant to purchase
shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock in an amount and at an
exercise price determined in accordance with the terms of such Treasury
Warrant.

Section 2.7 Withholding Rights.

  



  

The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person such
amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax (as defined herein) law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority (as defined
herein) by the Exchange Agent, such amounts withheld will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent.

this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), did not (and any SEC Reports
filed after the date of this Agreement will not) contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in
such SEC Reports or necessary in order to make the statements made in such SEC
Reports, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

  



    

 | 12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) Each of its financial statements contained in or incorporated by
reference into any SEC Reports (including any SEC Reports filed after the
date of this Agreement) (the " _Financial Statements_ ") complied (or, in the
case of SEC Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will comply) in

respective dates and the consolidated results of its operations and cash
flows for the periods indicated, in each case in accordance with generally

(iii) It and each of its Subsidiaries has devised and maintains a
system of "internal controls over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with general or
specific authorization of its Board of Directors and the duly authorized
executive officers of such party, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
consistently applied with respect to institutions such as such party or other

accountability for items therein, (iii) access to its and its Subsidiaries'
properties and assets is permitted only in accordance with general or

authorized executive officers of such party, and (iv) the recorded
accountability for items is compared with the actual levels at

differences.

  



  

(iv) Its "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules

information required to be disclosed by it in its SEC Reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC's rules and forms, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to its management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer required under the Exchange Act
with respect to such reports. It has disclosed, to its auditors and the audit
committee of its Board of Directors and on Section 3.3(f)(iv) of its
Disclosure Letter (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that
could adversely affect in any material respect its ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in its internal controls over financial
reporting. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency"
and "material weakness" shall have the meaning assigned to them in Public

 | 13| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(v) Each of its principal executive officer and principal financial
officer (or each former principal executive officer and each former principal
financial officer, as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule
13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") with respect to its SEC Reports,
and the statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate
in all material respects. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal
executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings
given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It is in compliance with all
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except for any non-
compliance that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(g) _Bank Reports_. It and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all
reports, forms, correspondence, registrations and statements, together with
any amendments required to be made with respect thereto (the " _Bank Reports_
"), that they were required to file since December 31, 2012 with the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the
Virginia State Corporation Commission and any other federal, state or foreign
governmental or regulatory agency or authority having jurisdiction over it or
each of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Regulatory Agencies_ "),
including any Bank Report required to be filed pursuant to the laws of the
United States, any state or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure
to file such Bank Report or to pay such fees and assessments, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on it. Any such Bank Report regarding it or any of its
Subsidiaries filed with or otherwise submitted to any Regulatory Agency
complied in all material respects with relevant legal requirements, including
as to content. Except for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency
in the ordinary course of its and its Subsidiaries business, there is no

(iii) Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has at any time been a
party to or maintained, sponsored, contributed to, or been obligated
to contribute to, or had any liability with respect to: (A) any plan subject
to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as

Section 3(37) and 4001(a)(3) or Section 413(f) of the Code); (B) a "multiple
employer plan" (within the meaning of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code);

401(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be
so qualified, as reflected in a current favorable determination letter (based
on Internal Revenue Service permitted determination request procedures) or
opinion letter, as applicable, or a filing for the same has been made with the
Internal Revenue Service seeking such a determination letter and that request
is still awaiting decision by the Internal Revenue Service (based on
Internal Revenue Service permitted determination request procedures). Nothing
has occurred since the date of any such determination that is reasonably
likely to affect adversely such qualification or exemption, or result in the
imposition of excise taxes or income taxes on unrelated business income under
the Code or ERISA with respect to any tax-qualified plan. There have been no
"terminations," "partial terminations" or "discontinuances of contributions,"
as such terms are used in Section 411 of the Code and the regulations

notice to and approval by the Internal Revenue Service and payment of all
obligations and liabilities attributable to such tax-qualified plans.

  



  

(vi) All required contributions (including all employer contributions
and employee salary reduction contributions), premiums and other payments due

contributions to any Benefit Plan have been contributed within the time
specified in ERISA and the Code and the respective regulations thereunder.
There are no "accumulated funding deficiencies," as defined in Section 412 of
the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, with respect to any "employee pension
benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, of it or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no request for a waiver from the Internal Revenue Service
with respect to any minimum funding requirement under Section 412 of the
Code.

engaged in any prohibited transactions, as defined in Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 406 of ERISA, with respect to any Benefit Plan or its related
trust. To its Knowledge, no "fiduciary," as defined in Section 3(21) of
ERISA, of any Benefit Plan has any liability for breach of fiduciary duty
under ERISA.

  



    

 | 19| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(viii) There are no actions, suits, investigations or claims pending, or
to its Knowledge threatened or anticipated, with respect to any of its or its
Subsidiaries' Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits). None of
its or its Subsidiaries' Benefit Plans is the subject of a pending or, to its
Knowledge, threatened investigation or audit by the Internal Revenue
Service, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, or any other federal or state governmental department or entity.

  



  

(ix) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) (A) result in, cause the vesting,
exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit to any current or former employee, leased
employee, independent contractor, officer, director or other service provider
of it or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) result in any (1) requirement to fund
any benefits or set aside benefits in a trust (including a rabbi trust) or
(2) limitation on the right of it or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge,
terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Benefit Plan or related
trust. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or
payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by it or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Section
3.3(o)(ix) of its Disclosure Letter sets forth accurate and complete data with
respect to each individual who has a contractual right to severance pay or
benefits triggered by a change in control or otherwise and the amounts
potentially payable to each such individual in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event) or as a result of a termination of employment or service, taking
into account any contractual provisions relating to Section 280G of the Code.
No Benefit Plan maintained by it or any of its Subsidiaries provides for the
gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code, or
otherwise.

  



  

(x) Except as set forth in Section 3.3(o)(x) of its Disclosure
Letter, it and its Subsidiaries have made prior to the date hereof all
bonus and commission payments to which they were required or are otherwise
committed to make to any employee or independent contractor under any Benefit
Plan for calendar years 2013, 2014 and 2015.

  



  

(xi) Each Benefit Plan of it and its Subsidiaries that is a health or
welfare plan has been amended and administered in accordance with the
requirements of the ACA. It and its Subsidiaries have complied in all respects
with the requirements of Section 4980H of the Code so as to avoid the
imposition of any taxes or assessable payments thereunder. Neither it nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation to provide postretirement
health, medical or life insurance benefits to any employees or former
employees, leased employees, independent contractors, officers, or directors,
or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, except as otherwise required under
state or federal benefits continuation laws. In the case of any such required
continuation coverage, the covered individual is required to pay the full
cost of coverage. No tax under Code Sections 4980B, 4980H or 5000 has been
incurred with respect to any Benefit Plan of it or its Subsidiaries, it, or
any of its Subsidiaries, and no circumstance exists which could give rise to
such tax.

  



    

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(p) _Insurance_. It and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable
insurers against such risks and in such amounts as its management
reasonably has determined to be prudent in accordance with industry
practices, and are in compliance in all material respects with
their insurance policies and are not in default under any of the terms
thereof. Each such insurance policy is outstanding and in full force and
effect, and all premiums and other payments due under any such policy have
been paid, and all claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely
fashion. Since December 31, 2015, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice of a premium increase or cancellation or a failure to
renew with respect to any insurance policy or bond or, within the last
three (3) calendar years and since January 1, 2016 has been refused any
insurance coverage sought or applied for, and it has no reason to believe
that existing insurance coverage cannot be renewed as and when the same shall
expire upon terms and conditions as favorable as those presently in effect,
other than possible increases in premiums or unavailability of coverage that
do not result from any extraordinary loss experience on the part of it or its
Subsidiaries. Set forth in Section 3.3(p) of its Disclosure Letter is a list
of all insurance policies or bonds currently maintained by it and its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(q) _Loan Portfolio; Allowance for Loan Losses; Mortgage Loan Buy
Backs_. Except as set forth in Section 3.3(q) of its Disclosure Letter and

applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general
equity principles, and no defense, offset or counterclaim has been asserted
with respect to any such loan which if successful could have a Material
Adverse Effect.

  



  

(ii) The allowance for possible loan losses (the " _Loan Loss
Allowance_ ") shown on its Financial Statements as of June 30, 2016 was, and
the Loan Loss Allowance to be shown on its Financial Statements as of any date
subsequent to the date of this Agreement will be, as of such dates, adequate
to provide for possible losses, net of recoveries relating to loans previously
charged off, in respect of loans outstanding (including letter of credit or
commitments to make loans or extend credit).

  



  

(iii) The reserve for losses with respect to other real estate owned
(" _OREO_ ") shown on its SEC Reports, Bank Reports or Financial Statements
as of June 30, 2016 were, and the OREO reserve to be shown on its SEC Reports,
Bank Reports or Financial Statements as of any date subsequent to the
execution of this Agreement will be, as of such dates, adequate to provide for
losses relating to the OREO portfolio of it and any of its Subsidiaries as of
the dates thereof.

  



    

 | 21|

Letter, as of September 30, 2016, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries was

(i) Except as described in Section 3.3(r) of its Disclosure Letter,
it and each of its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all
Environmental Laws (as defined herein). Neither it nor any of its

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) There are no past or present actions, activities, circumstances,
conditions, events or incidents that could reasonably form the basis of any
Environmental Claim or other claim or action or governmental investigation
that could result in the imposition of any liability arising under any
Environmental Laws against it or any of its Subsidiaries or against any person
or entity whose liability for any Environmental Claim it or any of its
Subsidiaries has or may have retained or assumed either contractually or by
operation of law.

  



  

(iv) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have
the following meanings:

  



  

(1) " _Environmental Claim_ " means any written notice from any

be amended by Access or Middleburg, as applicable) (A) is more favorable to
the shareholders of Access or Middleburg, as the case may be, from a financial
point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as it
may be proposed to be amended by Access or Middleburg, as applicable) and (B)
is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed and reasonably
likely to receive all required approvals of Governmental Authorities on a
timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms
proposed; provided that, for purposes of this definition of "Superior
Proposal," the Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such
term in Section 5.5(c), except the reference to "10% or more" in such
definition shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority" and "Acquisition
Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving
Middleburg or Access or one of their respective banking Subsidiaries.

(e) Except as provided in Section 5.5(f), neither the Board of
Directors of Middleburg, the Board of Directors of Access, nor, in each
case, any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner
adverse to the other party, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or
modify in any manner adverse to the other party, the approval, recommendation
or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors of Middleburg or
Access, as applicable, or any such committee thereof with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (a " _Change in Middleburg
Recommendation_ " or a " _Change in Access Recommendation_ ," respectively).

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors of Middleburg or
Access, as applicable, may either:

  



  

(i) enter into a definitive agreement to accept a Superior Proposal
and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(j) or Section 7.1(k), as
the case may be, provided that such party shall pay the Termination Fee
required to be paid pursuant to Section 7.4(b) or Section 7.4(d), as the case
may be; or

  



  

(ii) make a Change in Middleburg Recommendation or a Change in Access
Recommendation, as applicable, if and only if (A) an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of this
Section 5.5) is made to Middleburg or Access, as applicable, by a third
party, and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, (B) the Board of
Directors of Middleburg or Access, as applicable, has concluded in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) the Board
of Directors of Middleburg or Access, as applicable, have concluded in good
faith (after consultation with their outside legal counsel) that failure to do
so would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties to its shareholders under applicable law, (D) five (5) business days
shall have elapsed since the party proposing to take such action has given
written notice to the other party advising such other party that the
notifying party intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable
detail the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action (a " _Notice of
Recommendation Change_ ") (it being understood that any amendment to any
material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Recommendation Change, except that, in such case, the five (5) business day
period referred to in this clause (D) and in clauses (E) and (F) shall be
reduced to three (3) business days following the giving of such new Notice of
Recommendation Change), (E) during such five (5) business day period, the
notifying party has considered and, at the reasonable request of the other
party, engaged in good faith discussions with such party regarding, any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the
other party, and (F) the board of directors of the party proposing to take
such action, following such five (5) business day period, again reasonably
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its financial advisors, and taking into account any adjustment or
modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other party) that
such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal and that failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result
in a violation of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under applicable
law.

Section 5.9 Employee Benefit Plans.

  



  

(a) On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Date, the Continuing Corporation shall provide to officers and employees of
Middleburg and its Subsidiaries, who at or after the Effective Date become
employees of the Continuing Corporation or its Subsidiaries (" _Middleburg
Continuing Employees_ "), employee benefits under Benefit Plans maintained by
the Continuing Corporation, on terms and conditions which are the same as for
similarly situated officers and employees of the Continuing Corporation
and its Subsidiaries. Until such time as the Middleburg Continuing Employees
are able to participate in the Benefit Plans of the Continuing Corporation,
the Continuing Corporation shall maintain for the benefit of the Middleburg
Continuing Employees the Benefit Plans maintained by Middleburg immediately
prior to the Effective Date (it being understood that participation in the
Continuing Corporation's Benefit Plans may commence at different times with
respect to each Benefit Plan); _provided_ , _however_ , that this
provision shall not apply to any Benefit Plan of Middleburg or its
Subsidiaries that was terminated or in which participation was frozen on or
prior to the Effective Date.

  



  

(b) For purposes of participation, vesting and, for vacation or
similar paid time off accrual only, benefit accrual under the
Continuing Corporation's Benefit Plans, service with or credited by
Middleburg or any of its Subsidiaries shall be treated as service with the
Continuing Corporation. To the extent permitted under applicable law, the
Continuing Corporation shall cause welfare Benefit Plans maintained by the
Continuing Corporation that cover the Middleburg Continuing Employees after
the Effective Date to (i) waive any waiting period and restrictions and
limitations for preexisting conditions or insurability (except for pre-
existing conditions that were excluded, or restrictions or limitations that
were applicable, under the Benefit Plans maintained by Middleburg), and (ii)
cause any deductible, co-insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by
the Middleburg Continuing Employees under welfare Benefit Plans maintained by
Middleburg to be credited to such Middleburg Continuing Employees under
welfare Benefit Plans maintained by the Continuing Corporation, so as to
reduce the amount of any deductible, co-insurance, or maximum out-of-
pocket payments payable by such Middleburg Continuing Employees under welfare
Benefit Plans maintained by the Continuing Corporation.

  



  

(c) With respect to the Middleburg Financial Corporation 401(k) Plan
(the " _Middleburg 401(k) Plan_ "), Middleburg shall cause such plan to be
fully vested and terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Date,
in accordance with applicable law and subject to the receipt of all
applicable regulatory or governmental approvals. Each Middleburg Continuing
Employee who is a participant in the Middleburg 401(k) Plan shall be eligible
to participate in Access's 401(k) plan as soon as administratively practical
after the Effective Date, and account balances under the terminated Middleburg
401(k) Plan will be eligible for distribution or rollover, including direct
rollover, to Access's 401(k) plan for the Middleburg Continuing Employees. Any
other former employee of Middleburg or its Subsidiaries who is employed by
Access or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Date shall be eligible to be a
participant in Access's 401(k) plan upon complying with eligibility
requirements. Access shall take commercially reasonable steps to cause the
Access 401(k) plan to accept the direct rollover of loan notes from the
Middleburg 401(k) Plan to the Access 401(k) plan for each Middleburg
Continuing Employee who elects such a direct rollover.

(d) With regard to the Middleburg Financial Corporation Money
Purchase Pension Plan (the " _MPPP_ "), prior to the Effective Date,
Middleburg shall amend the MPPP, effective as of the Effective Date, to cease
all participation in, cease all future contributions to, fully vest the
account balances of participants thereunder, and terminate the MPPP in
accordance with applicable law. Middleburg shall timely provide all notices
required under ERISA and the Code in order for the freeze of all contributions
and termination of the MPPP to be effective on the Effective Date. In
determining the contribution to the MPPP for the 2017 plan year (the "
_2017 Contribution_ "), which 2017 Contribution shall be properly accrued as
a liability of Middleburg prior to the Effective Date, the parties agree, and
Middleburg shall reflect such agreement in an amendment to the MPPP, that the
2017 Contribution shall be made to participants in the MPPP who are employed
on the Effective Date and shall be based upon a participant's
compensation (as defined in the MPPP) through the Effective Date. Access
shall submit the MPPP for a favorable determination letter following the
Effective Date and distributions shall be made in accordance with applicable
law after receipt of a favorable determination letter.

  



  

(e) Within thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg
shall take all steps necessary to terminate effective immediately
preceding the Effective Date the Middleburg Financial Corporation
Supplemental Benefit Plan. Access shall be responsible for payment of amounts
accrued under such plan to the participants on the thirtieth day following the
Effective Date in a lump sum, net of applicable tax withholdings. All
documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with the implementation
of this Section 5.9(e) shall be subject to Access's prior review and approval,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Middleburg
also agrees to properly and fully accrue all liabilities associated with such
plan, and any other non-qualified plans or compensation arrangements, on its
books prior to the Effective Date.

  



  

(f) Prior to the Effective Date, at the request of Access,
Middleburg shall take all steps necessary to terminate any Benefit Plans of
Middleburg or a Subsidiary immediately preceding the Effective Date and pay
any benefits due thereunder in accordance with the terms of any such plan
provided, however, that Access agrees to maintain the Middleburg Benefit Plans
that are group health plans through the end of the plan year that ends during
the calendar year that includes the Effective Date.

  



  

(g) Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall be construed to limit the
right of the Continuing Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, from and
after the Effective Date, to amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans
maintained by Access or Middleburg or their respective Subsidiaries before
the Effective Date to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by
the terms of the applicable Benefit Plan.

  



  

Section 5.10 Reservation of Shares; NASDAQ Listing.

  



  

(a) Access shall take all corporate action as may be necessary to
authorize and reserve for issuance such number of shares of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement,
and to cause all such shares, when issued pursuant to this Agreement, to be
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

  



    

 | 36| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Access shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause the shares
of the Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NASDAQ Global Market, subject to official notice
of issuance, as promptly as practicable, and in any event before the
Effective Date.

  



  

Section 5.11 Indemnification.

  



  

(a) Following the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless any person who has rights to indemnification from Middleburg or any
of its Subsidiaries (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") (in all capacities), to the
same extent and on the same conditions as such person was entitled to
indemnification pursuant to applicable law and Middleburg's Organizational
Documents or any Middleburg Subsidiary's Organizational Documents, as the
case may be, as in effect on the date of this Agreement (including advancing
expenses when requested, subject to such person's compliance with Section
13.1-699 of the VSCA). Without limiting the foregoing, in any case or
proceeding in which corporate approval may be required to effectuate any
indemnification, the Continuing Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary shall
direct, if any Indemnified Party elects, that the determination of
permissibility of indemnification shall be made by independent counsel
mutually agreed upon between the Continuing Corporation or such Subsidiary
and such Indemnified Party.

  



  

(b) The Continuing Corporation shall, at or prior to the Effective
Date, purchase a six (6) year "tail" prepaid policy on the same terms and
conditions as the existing directors' and officers' liability (and fiduciary)
insurance maintained by Middleburg from insurance carriers with comparable
credit ratings, covering, without limitation, the Merger; provided,
however, that the cost of such "tail" policy shall in no event exceed three
hundred percent (300%) of the amount of the last annual premium paid by
Middleburg for such existing directors' and officers' liability (and
fiduciary) insurance. If, but for the proviso to the immediately preceding
sentence, the Continuing Corporation would be required to expend more
than three hundred percent (300%) of current annual premiums, the Continuing
Corporation will obtain the maximum amount of that insurance obtainable by
payment of annual premiums equal to three hundred percent (300%) of current
annual premiums.

  



  

(c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to
or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to Middleburg or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their
respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.11 is not
prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

  



  

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her respective heirs and
legal representatives. The rights to indemnification and advancement and the
other rights provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to law,
contract or otherwise.

Section 5.12 Employment and Other Arrangements.

  



  

(a) Except for employees of Middleburg and its Subsidiaries with
individual agreements that provide for payment of severance under
certain circumstances (who will be paid severance only in accordance with
such agreements), Access agrees that each employee of Middleburg and its
Subsidiaries who is involuntarily terminated by Access or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than for cause) on or within six months of the Effective
Date shall receive a severance payment equal to two weeks of base pay (at the
rate in effect on the termination date) for each year of service at
Middleburg or its Subsidiaries (with credit for partial years of service) with
a maximum payment equal to twenty-six weeks of base pay. A former employee of
Middleburg or its Subsidiaries must execute a general release of claims
before any severance payment shall be made pursuant to this Section 5.12(a),
and all such releases of claims shall be in a form approved in writing in
advance by Access.

  



  

(b) Middleburg and Access will establish a retention bonus pool that
will be dedicated to certain of their non-executive officer employees
for purposes of retaining such employees prior to and after the Effective
Date, with the participating employees and specific terms of such retention
bonuses to be determined by Middleburg and Access.

  



  

(c) Within thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg
shall take all steps necessary to terminate the employment agreements listed
on Section 5.12(c) of the Disclosure Letter of Middleburg (collectively, the
" _Affected Agreements_ ") immediately preceding the Effective Date. On the
ninetieth day after the Effective Date, Access shall pay in a lump sum, net
of applicable tax withholdings, (A) to Messrs. Shook, Culver and Mehra, the
cash amount described in Section 7(h)(i) of the Affected Agreements and (B)
to Mr. Hartley, the amounts described in Section 7(d)(1) of the Affected
Agreement; provided, however, that such cash amount shall be reduced as
necessary to insure that the amount so paid (when aggregated with any other
benefits or payments payable upon a change of control to the affected
executive) will not constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code, as determined by Access's
outside accounting firm, in consultation with Troutman Sanders and counsel to
the affected executive. All documents issued, adopted or executed in
connection with the implementation of this Section 5.12(c) shall be subject to
Access's prior review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg shall take all steps
necessary to obtain (i) a general release from each of the individuals listed
in Section 5.12(d)(i) of the Disclosure Letter of Middleburg associated with
each individual's respective employment prior to the Effective Date, and (ii)
a separation, noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreement from the individual
listed in Section 5.12(d)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter of Middleburg
associated with such individual's termination of employment. Such agreements
shall be in a form acceptable to Access.

On Section 5.13 of its Disclosure Letter, Middleburg has provided a list of
all leases with respect to real or personal property used by it or any

commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents necessary or
appropriate to transfer and assign, as of the Effective Date, all
right, title and interest of Middleburg and each of its Subsidiaries to the
Continuing Corporation and to permit the use and operation of the leased
premises by the Continuing Corporation.

Access and Middleburg shall be empowered, upon their mutual agreement and at
any time prior to the Effective Date, to change the method or structure of
effecting the combination of Access and Middleburg (including the provisions
of Article 1 and Article 2), if and to the extent they both deem such
change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; provided that no such
change shall (i) alter or change the Exchange Ratio, (ii) adversely affect
the tax treatment of Middleburg's shareholders pursuant to this Agreement,
(iii) adversely affect the tax treatment of Middleburg or Access pursuant to
this Agreement or (iv) materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. The parties
hereto agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to
this Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with Section 8.3.

  



  

Section 5.15 Takeover Laws.

  



  

If any Takeover Laws may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, each party hereto and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary and legally permissible (other than as
contemplated by Section 5.3) so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any such laws or regulations on any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.16 Certain Policies.

  



  

At Closing, Middleburg shall, consistent with GAAP and applicable banking
laws and regulations, modify or change its Loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, Tax,
litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan
classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that
is consistent with that of Access.

  



  

Section 5.17 Supplemental Indenture.

  



  

Prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg and Access shall take all actions
necessary for Access to enter into a supplemental indenture with the trustee
of Middleburg's Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debt Securities due 2034 to
evidence the succession of Access as the obligor on those securities as of
the Effective Date. The form of supplemental indenture shall be reasonably
acceptable to Access. Access agrees to assume Middleburg's obligations under
the above indentures and related subordinated debentures as well as under
guaranty agreements related to the trust preferred securities issued by
Middleburg's trust subsidiary, MFC Capital Trust II.

Agreement and shall give the other the opportunity to participate in, but
not control, the defense or settlement of any such litigation. In addition,
no such settlement by Middleburg shall be agreed to without Access's prior
written consent, no such settlement by Access shall be agreed to without
Middleburg's prior written consent, and no such consent of Access or
Middleburg shall be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

Section 5.20 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b).

  



  

Middleburg and Access agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and
retain certain directors and officers of Middleburg in connection with the
Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Date, it is desirable that such
directors and officers not be subject to a risk of liability under Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act, and for that compensatory and retentive purposes
agree to the provisions of this Section 5.20. The Board of Directors of
Access and of Middleburg, or a committee of non-employee directors (as such
term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act)
thereof, shall adopt a resolution providing that the disposition of Middleburg
Common Stock, Middleburg Stock Awards or Middleburg Stock Options by such
directors and officers, and the acquisition of Continuing Corporation Common
Stock by such directors and officers, in each case pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, are intended to be exempt from
liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

PLAN OF MERGER

  

BETWEEN

  

ACCESS NATIONAL CORPORATION

  

AND

  

MIDDLEBURG FINANCIAL CORPORATION

  



  

Pursuant to this Plan of Merger (the " _Plan of Merger_ "), Middleburg

ARTICLE 1

  

Terms of the Merger

  



  

1.1 The Merger.

  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of October 21, 2016, by and between Access and

Middleburg will be merged with and into Access (the " _Merger_ "),
in accordance with the provisions of Virginia law, and with the effect
specified in Section 13.1-721 of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (the "
_VSCA_ "). The separate corporate existence of Middleburg thereupon shall
cease, and Access will be the surviving corporation in the Merger (Access as
existing on and after the Effective Date is sometimes referred to herein
as the " _Continuing Corporation_ " whenever reference is made to it as of
the Effective Date or thereafter). The Merger shall become effective on such
date and time as may be determined in accordance with Section 1.2 of the
Agreement (the " _Effective Date_ "). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from and after the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation
shall possess all rights, privileges, properties, immunities, powers and
franchises of Middleburg, and all of the debts, liabilities, obligations,
claims, restrictions and duties of Middleburg shall become the debts,
liabilities, obligations, claims, restrictions and duties of the Continuing
Corporation.

  



  

ARTICLE 2

  

Merger Consideration; Exchange Procedures

  



  

2.1 Conversion of Shares.

  



  

At the Effective Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Access or Middleburg or the holder of any of the following securities:

  



  

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.835 per share, of
Access (" _Access Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Date shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be
affected by the Merger.

  



    



 



    



  

(b) All shares of common stock, par value $2.50 per share, of
Middleburg (" _Middleburg Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Date that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Access
or Middleburg (other than shares of Middleburg Common Stock held in trust
accounts (including grantor or rabbi trust accounts), managed accounts and
similar accounts, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that
are beneficially owned by third parties) (any such shares, the "
_Middleburg Cancelled Shares_ ") shall no longer be outstanding, shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Access or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) Subject to Section 2.2 of this Plan of Merger, each share of
Middleburg Common Stock, except for Middleburg Cancelled Shares, issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date will cease to be
outstanding and will be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive
1.3314 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.835 per share, of the
Continuing Corporation (" _Continuing Corporation Common Stock_ ") (together,
with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Continuing Corporation Common
Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.5 of this Plan of Merger, the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

  



  

(d) If, between the date hereof and the Effective Date, the
outstanding shares of Access Common Stock or Middleburg Common Stock
shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar
change in capitalization, appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be
made to the Exchange Ratio.

  



  

2.2 Exchange Procedures.

  



  

(a) _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Date,
Access shall appoint an exchange and paying agent reasonably acceptable
to Middleburg (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment and exchange of the
Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) _Access to Make Merger Consideration Available._ At or prior to
the Effective Date, Access shall for the benefit of holders of shares of
Middleburg Common Stock and for exchange in accordance with this Article II,
(i) deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent an amount of
cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to this
Article II in lieu of fractional shares of Continuing Corporation Common
Stock, and (ii) duly authorize and direct issuance by the Exchange Agent
of non-certificated shares represented by book-entry registry of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to this Article 2.

  



    



 



    



  

(c) _Distributions to Holders of Middleburg Common Stock_. Upon the
Effective Date, each holder of an outstanding share of Middleburg Common
Stock who has properly surrendered such Certificates (as defined herein) or
non-certificated shares represented by book-entry registry of Middleburg
Common Stock (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") to the Exchange Agent (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates) will be entitled to evidence
of issuance in book entry form the number of whole shares of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock (except if such holder has made an election to
receive a physical stock certificate pursuant to Section 2.2(d) of this
Agreement) and the amount of cash, if any, into which the aggregate number of
shares of Middleburg Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this
Plan of Merger. If a holder of Middleburg Common Stock surrenders such
Certificates representing shares of Middleburg Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") or Book-Entry Shares and a properly executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent at least five (5) business days prior to
the Effective Date, then Access shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Exchange Agent to deliver, within two (2) business days following
the Effective Date, to such holder of Middleburg Common Stock the
consideration into which the shares of such Middleburg Common Stock have been
converted pursuant to this Plan of Merger. If a holder of Middleburg Common
Stock surrenders such Certificates or Book Entry Shares and a properly
executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent at any time after
five (5) business days prior to the Effective Date, then Access shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to promptly, but
in no event later than five (5) business days following receipt of such
Certificates or Book Entry Shares and a properly executed letter of
transmittal, deliver to such holder of Middleburg Common Stock the
consideration into which the shares of such Middleburg Common Stock have been
converted pursuant to this Plan of Merger. The Exchange Agent shall not be
obligated to deliver the consideration to which any former holder of
Middleburg Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such
holder surrenders his or her Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for exchange as
provided in this Section 2.2. The Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall be, as applicable, duly endorsed or accompanied with such
transfer and other documentation as the Exchange Agent may require. Any other
provision of this Plan of Merger notwithstanding, neither the Continuing
Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to a holder of the
Middleburg Common Stock for any amounts paid or property delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law.

  



  

(d) _Letter of Transmittal_. Access shall take all steps necessary
to cause the Exchange Agent, within five (5) business days after
the Effective Date, to mail to each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares who has not previously surrendered such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares a form letter of transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration into which the shares of such
Middleburg Common Stock have been converted pursuant to this Plan of Merger.
Such letter of transmittal shall permit each holder of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares to elect to receive, in lieu of shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock represented by book-entry registry, a physical stock certificate
representing shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to
this Article II

  



  

(e) _Lost Certificates_. A holder of Middleburg Common Stock whose
Certificates have been lost, destroyed, stolen or are otherwise missing shall
be entitled to receive its portion of the Merger Consideration and dividends
or distributions to which such shareholder shall be entitled upon compliance
with reasonable conditions imposed by the Continuing Corporation and the
Exchange Agent pursuant to applicable law and as required in accordance with
the Continuing Corporation's and the Exchange Agent's standard policy
(including the requirement that the shareholder furnish an affidavit of lost
certificate, surety bond or other customary indemnity).

  



    



 



    



  

2.3 Rights of Former Holders of Middleburg Common Stock.

  



  

At the Effective Date, the stock transfer books of Middleburg shall be closed
as to holders of Middleburg Common Stock, and no transfer of Middleburg Common
Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until
surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2 of
this Plan of Merger, each Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall from and after
the Effective Date represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor. To the
extent permitted by law, former holders of record of Middleburg Common Stock
shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Date at any meeting
of Continuing Corporation shareholders the number of whole shares of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which their respective shares of
Middleburg Common Stock are converted, regardless of whether such holders have
surrendered their Book-Entry Shares or Certificates for exchange as provided
in Section 2.2 of this Plan of Merger. Whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by the Continuing Corporation on the Continuing
Corporation Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Date, the declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions on all shares issuable pursuant to this Plan of Merger, but no
dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of Middleburg
Common Stock as of any time subsequent to the Effective Date shall be
delivered to the holder of any Book-Entry Share or Certificate issued and
outstanding at the Effective Date until such holder surrenders such Book-
Entry Share or Certificate for exchange as provided in Section 2.2 of this
Plan of Merger. However, upon surrender of such Book-Entry Share or
Certificate representing Middleburg Common Stock the Merger
Consideration, together with all such undelivered dividends or other
distributions without interest, shall be delivered and paid with respect to
each Book-Entry Share or other share represented by such Certificate.

  



  

2.4 Middleburg Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Date, each option to purchase shares of
Middleburg Common Stock (a " _Middleburg Stock Option_ ") granted under an
equity or equity-based compensation plan of Middleburg (a " _Middleburg Stock
Plan_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Date shall cease, at the Effective Date,
to represent a right to acquire Middleburg Common Stock and shall be converted
at the Effective Date, without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of
(i) the difference between the closing sale price of Middleburg Common Stock
on the NASDAQ Global Market on the trading day immediately preceding the
Effective Date and the per share exercise price of the Middleburg Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Date, and (ii) the number of shares of
Middleburg Common Stock subject to such Middleburg Stock Option, subject to
any applicable withholdings. If the exercise price of a Middleburg Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Date is greater than the closing
sale price of Middleburg Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on the
trading day immediately preceding the Effective Date, then at the Effective
Date such option shall be cancelled without any payment made in exchange
therefor. Prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg shall take all commercially
reasonable actions to give effect to this Section 2.4(a) including, without
limitation, using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a written consent
from each holder of a Middleburg Stock Option to the cancellation of such
Middleburg Stock Option in exchange for the cash payment provided by this
Section 2.4(a).

  



    



 



    



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg shall take all actions
necessary to cause each Middleburg Stock Plan to terminate immediately prior
to the Effective Date.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Date, each restricted stock award granted under
a Middleburg Stock Plan (a " _Middleburg Stock Award_ ") which is unvested or
contingent and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date, shall
fully vest and shall be converted into the right to receive, without
interest, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Plan of Merger,
and the shares of Middleburg Common Stock subject to such Middleburg Stock
Award will be treated in the same manner as all other shares of
Middleburg Common Stock for such purposes.

  



  

2.5 No Fractional Shares.

  



  

Each holder of shares of Middleburg Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the
Merger which would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock
multiplied by the closing sale price of Access Common Stock on the NASDAQ
Global Market for the trading day immediately preceding (but not including)
the Effective Date.

  



  

2.6 Treasury Warrant.

  



  

At the Effective Date, each warrant to purchase Middleburg Common Stock
originally issued to the United States Department of the Treasury (the "
_Treasury_ ") pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement incorporated into
the Letter Agreement, dated January 30, 2009, between Middleburg and the
Treasury, including separate warrants derived therefrom, if any, (each a "
_Treasury Warrant_ "), which is then outstanding and unexercised shall cease
to represent a right to acquire Middleburg Common Stock and shall be
converted into a warrant to purchase shares of Continuing Corporation Common
Stock in an amount and at an exercise price determined in accordance with the
terms of such Treasury Warrant.

  



  

2.7 Withholding Rights.

  



  

The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Plan of Merger to any person
such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in the
Agreement) law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to
the appropriate Governmental Authority (as defined in the Agreement) by the
Exchange Agent, such amounts withheld will be treated for all purposes of
this Plan of Merger as having been paid to such person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent.
