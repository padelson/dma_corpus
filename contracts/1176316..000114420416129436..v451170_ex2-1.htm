by the Continuing Corporation on the Continuing Corporation Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective

dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of Middleburg Common Stock as of any time subsequent to the Effective
Date shall be delivered to the holder of any Book-Entry Share or Certificate issued and outstanding at the Effective Date until
such holder surrenders such Book-Entry Share or Certificate for exchange as provided in Section 2.2 of this Agreement. However,
upon surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate representing Middleburg Common Stock the Merger Consideration, together
with all such undelivered dividends or other distributions without interest, shall be delivered and paid with respect to each
Book-Entry Share or other share represented by such Certificate.</P>
