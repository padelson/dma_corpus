           (b) Of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, the Estate Representative shall
hold Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) in an interest bearing segregated account
(the "WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT ACCOUNT") for purposes of any adjustment
provided for in Section 2.03 and until such time as the Final Working Capital
has been determined and any payment due to Buyer as a result of any adjustment
provided for in Section 2.03 has been made.

           (c) Further, the Estate Representative shall hold Seven Million
Dollars ($7,000,000) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price in an interest bearing
segregated account (the "INDEMNITY ACCOUNT") for a period of six months
following the Closing for the purpose of satisfying claims by Buyer for Buyer
Indemnified Losses, provided, that if there is then pending a claim by the Buyer
for Buyer Indemnified Losses, the Estate Representative shall retain in the
Indemnity Account, pending resolution of such claim, an amount equal to the
amount so claimed by the Buyer (but in no event more than the amount then
remaining in the Indemnity Account).

           Section 2.03. Adjustment of Purchase Price.

           (a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than forty-five (45)
days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered
to the Estate Representative the Closing Statement (as defined below) and a
certificate based on such Closing Statement setting forth the Buyer's
calculation of Closing Working Capital. The closing statement (the "CLOSING
STATEMENT") shall fairly present in all material respects the consolidated Net
Working Capital of the Company as of the end of business on the Closing Date
("CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL"). "NET WORKING CAPITAL" means, with respect to the
Company and the Subsidiaries: (i) cash and restricted cash (for purposes of
clarity, cash includes cash equivalents); plus, (ii) accounts receivable, net of
appropriate reserves; plus, (iii) inventory (for purposes of clarity, for
finished goods, net of reserves); plus, (iv) piece goods at contractor (for
purposes of clarity, net of reserves); plus, (v) piece goods at AEL (for
purposes of clarity, net of reserves); plus, (vi) prepaid and other current
assets (for purposes of clarity, not including income tax refund, deferred tax
asset, or any Federal or state income tax asset); less, (vii) accounts payable
(for purposes of clarity, post-petition); less, (viii) accrued expenses and
other (for purposes of clarity, not including (a) interest payable, (b) deferred
income or current portion of deferred income, and (c) income tax payable,
deferred tax liability, or any Federal or state income tax accrual); less, (ix)
revolver (for purposes of clarity, under the Post-Petition Bank Credit
Agreement, cash borrowings only, and whether or not the revolver is classified
as a short term or long term liability), in each case as determined in
accordance with GAAP (to the extent applicable) and the Company's historical
internal reporting accounting practices, consistently applied between the
Balance Sheet Date and the Closing Date, and as reflected as a line item on the
Company's internal reporting balance sheets; provided that "Net Working Capital"
shall exclude any insurance claim (or cash attributable to any insurance claim)
for a loss arising after the Balance Sheet Date relating to assets reflected in
the Balance Sheet that would not otherwise be included in Net Working Capital.

           (b) If the Estate Representative disagrees with the Buyer's
calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(a),
the Estate Representative may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Closing Statement, deliver a notice to the Buyer disagreeing with such
calculation and setting forth the Estate Representative's calculation of such
amount. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as
to which the Estate Representative disagrees, and the Estate Representative
shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the
Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered
pursuant to Section 2.03(a).

           (c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to
Section 2.03(b), the Buyer and the Estate Representative shall, during the
fifteen (15) days following such delivery, use their best efforts to reach
agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be
required, the amount of Closing Working Capital, which amount shall not be less
than the amount thereof shown in the Buyer's calculation delivered pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) nor more than the amount thereof shown in the Estate
Representative's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(b). If during
such period, the Buyer and the Estate Representative are unable to reach such
agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause KPMG LLP (the "ACCOUNTING
REFEREE") to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the
purpose of calculating Closing Working Capital. In making such calculation, the
Accounting Referee shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing
Statement and the Estate Representative calculation of Closing Working Capital
as to which the Estate Representative has disagreed. The Accounting Referee
shall deliver to the Buyer and the Estate Representative, as promptly as
practicable (but in any case no later than thirty (30) days from the date of


                                       10
<PAGE>
engagement of the Accounting Referee), a report setting forth such calculation.
Such report shall be final and binding upon the Buyer and the Estates. The cost
of such review and report shall be borne equally by the Buyer and the Estates.

           (d) The Buyer and the Estate Representative shall, and shall cause
their respective representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of
the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital and in the
conduct of the review referred to in this Section 2.03, including, without
limitation, the making available to the extent necessary of books, records, work
papers and personnel.

           (e) If Final Working Capital exceeds the Agreed-to Working Capital,
the Buyer shall pay to the Estate Representative, in the manner and with
interest as provided in Section 2.03(f), the amount of such excess. If the
Agreed-to Working Capital exceeds Final Working Capital, the Estate
Representative shall pay to the Buyer as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in
the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.03(f), the amount of such
excess. Any payment made by the Estate Representative pursuant to this Section
2.03 shall be made solely from the Working Capital Adjustment Account under the
Plan. The Working Capital Adjustment Account shall be the Buyer's sole source of
recovery for any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 2.03. "FINAL WORKING
CAPITAL" means Closing Working Capital (i) as shown in the Buyer's calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(a) if no notice of disagreement with respect
thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(b); or (ii) if such a notice
of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed by Buyer and the Estate
Representative pursuant to Section 2.03(c) or (B) in the absence of such
agreement, as shown in the Accounting Referee's calculation delivered pursuant
to Section 2.03(c); provided, however, that in no event shall Final Working
Capital be more than the Estate Representative's calculation of Closing Working
Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(b) or less than the Buyer's
calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(a).

           (f) Any payment pursuant to Section 2.03 shall be made at a mutually
convenient time and place within three Business Days after Final Working Capital
has been determined by wire transfer by the Buyer or the Estate Representative,
as the case may be, of immediately available funds to the account of such other
party as may be designated in writing by such other party. The amount of any
payment to be made pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall bear interest from and
including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per
annum equal to the rate of interest announced by Bank of America, N.A. from time
to time as its base rate in New York City in effect from time to time during the
period from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be
payable at the same time as the payments to which it relates and shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty five (365) days
and the actual number of delays elapsed.

           (g) The Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to the
aggregate of the claims, determined as provided in Section 502 of the Bankruptcy
Code, of the non-Debtor party to each executory Contract rejected at the request
of the Buyer pursuant to Section 7.05(b) (each, a "REJECTED CONTRACT Claim"),
plus the Debtors' reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
procedure set forth in Section 7.05(b). Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 2.03(f), the Buyer shall pay the increase in Purchase Price, if any,
required by this Section 2.03(g) at the Closing or, as to any Rejected Contract
Claim whose amount has not been agreed to by the Company and the Buyer by the
Closing, then within five Business Days after the amount of any Rejected
Contract Claim is determined by agreement of the Company and the Buyer or by
Order of the Bankruptcy Court.

           Section 2.04. Closing. The closing (the "CLOSING") of the purchase
and sale of the Shares hereunder shall take place at the offices of Weil,
Gotshal & Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, as soon as
practicable after, but in no event later than five (5) business days after,
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than those
conditions which will be satisfied on the Closing Date), or at such other time

           Section 2.05. Stock Certificates. At the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to the Buyer a certificate for the Shares, duly registered in the name

of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, as currently in
effect.

           Section 3.02. Corporate Authorization. The execution, delivery and,

as now in effect or as may be amended pursuant to the Plan, (ii) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 3.03, violate any applicable
law, rule, regulation or Order, except for any such violations which have not
had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

other material action by any Person under, constitute a material default under,
or give rise to any material right of termination, cancellation or acceleration

provision of any material agreement or other material instrument binding upon
the Company or any Subsidiary or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of

                            COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

           The Company agrees that:

           Section 5.01. Conduct of the Company. Except as set forth on Schedule
5.01, from the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall
cause the Subsidiaries to, conduct its businesses in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and to use its reasonable best efforts to
preserve intact its business organizations and relationships with third parties
and to keep available the services of its present officers and employees.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date hereof until the
Closing Date, the Company, except as set forth on Schedule 5.01, will not, and
will not permit any Subsidiary to:

           (a) adopt or propose any change in its certificate of incorporation
or bylaws, except, as contemplated by this Agreement, upon the confirmation of
the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court;

           (b) merge or consolidate with any other Person or (other than in the
ordinary course of business) acquire a material amount of assets from any other
Person;

           (c) sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of any material assets
or property except (i) pursuant to existing Contracts or commitments not
rejected by the Company or any Subsidiary prior to the date hereof and (ii) in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

           (d) declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution of
cash or other property with respect to any shares of capital stock of such
Person, or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding shares of

           (e) without the written consent of the Buyer, assume or reject any
contract, lease or other agreement under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

           Section 5.02. Access to Information. From the date hereof until the
Closing Date, the Company will (i) upon reasonable prior notice, give, and will
cause each Subsidiary to give, the Buyer, its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to the offices, properties, books and records of the Company and
the Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish, and will cause each Subsidiary to furnish, to
the Buyer, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives such financial and operating data and other information relating
to the Company or any Subsidiary as such Persons may reasonably request and


                                       27
<PAGE>
(iii) instruct the employees, counsel and financial advisors of the Company or
any Subsidiary to cooperate with the Buyer in its investigation of the Company
or any Subsidiary. Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted
in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business
of the Company and the Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer
shall not have access to personnel records of the Company and the Subsidiaries
relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or
other information which in the Company's good faith opinion is sensitive or the
disclosure of which could subject the Company or any Subsidiary to risk of
liability.

           Section 5.03. Notices of Certain Events. The Company shall promptly
notify Buyer of:

           (a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

           (b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental or
Regulatory Authority in connection with the business operations of the Company
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

           (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings pending
or, to its Knowledge, threatened against or relating to the Company or any
Subsidiary that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.12 or that would
reasonably be expected to affect the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

           (d) any objection to, or appeal from, the (i) Approval Order, (ii)
Administrative Claim Bar Date Order, (iii) approval of the Disclosure Statement
or (iv) entry of the Confirmation Order; and

           (e) any event or occurrence that would cause any representation or
warranty of the Company to be untrue in any material respect.

           Section 5.04. Disclosure Statement and Plan. (a) Not later than ten
(10) Business Days after the Bankruptcy Court enters the Approval Order or such
longer period as may be agreed to by the Company and the Buyer, the Company and
the other Debtors shall file the Plan with the Bankruptcy Court and seek
approval from the Bankruptcy Court of a Second Amended and Restated Disclosure
Statement, consistent with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
and subject in form and substance to the reasonable approval of the Buyer (the
"DISCLOSURE STATEMENT"), recommending the approval of the Plan. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Plan will provide for payment and satisfaction of all
Excluded Liabilities. All Old Common Stock and any rights to purchase Old Common
Stock will be discharged, cancelled or otherwise terminated pursuant to the Plan
and upon consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. All information
concerning the Company and the other Debtors provided by the Company and/or the
other Debtors and contained in the Disclosure Statement shall be, as applicable,
accurate in all material respects and shall comply with the requirements of the
Bankruptcy Code and other applicable law. The Company shall promptly notify the
Buyer if at any time before the Effective Date it becomes aware that the
Disclosure Statement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they


                                       28
<PAGE>
were made, not misleading. In such event, the Company shall make the appropriate
filings with the Bankruptcy Court regarding such misstatement or omission and
take such other actions to address such misstatement or omission as required by
the Bankruptcy Court.

           (b) Upon approval of the Disclosure Statement by the Bankruptcy
Court, the Company and the other Debtors shall transmit the Disclosure Statement
to holders of claims and equity interests in the Reorganization Cases. The
Company shall use, and cause each of the other Debtors to use, their reasonable
best efforts to solicit acceptance of the Plan and obtain the entry of the
Confirmation Order (including by seeking confirmation of the Plan pursuant to
Section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code in the event any class of claims or
interests shall have failed to accept the Plan or in the event any such class is
deemed to have rejected the Plan) as soon as practicable after approval of the
Disclosure Statement. Prior to the filing by Debtors of any amendment or
supplement to the Plan or the Disclosure Statement, or any motion or other
pleading describing or affecting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company shall provide a copy thereof to the Buyer and its
counsel, and the Buyer and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such amendment, supplement, motion or pleading. The
Company shall provide to the Buyer and to counsel for the Buyer copies of any
and all pleadings filed by the Debtors (or any of them) with respect to the
Reorganization Cases.

           (c) If the Confirmation Order or any other Order of the Bankruptcy
Court relating to (i) this Agreement, (ii) the Disclosure Statement, (iii) the
solicitation of acceptance of the Plan, or (iv) confirmation of the Plan, shall
be appealed by any party (or a petition for certiorari or motion for rehearing
or reargument shall be filed with respect thereto), the Company agrees to take
such steps, if any, as may be reasonable and appropriate to prosecute in good
faith such appeal, petition or motion, or defend against such appeal, petition
or motion, at the cost and expense of the Company, and to use reasonable efforts
to obtain an expedited resolution of any such appeal, petition or motion, all
with the objective of effecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided that nothing herein shall require the Company to appeal from an Order
as to which the Company does not believe bona fide grounds for appeal exist.

           (d) The Estate Representative shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) file any
pleading or take other action in the Bankruptcy Court with respect to this
Agreement, the Plan or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby that is inconsistent with the full performance and implementation of
the provisions of this Agreement, subject to the fiduciary duties of the
Company; provided, however, that nothing contained in the foregoing shall be
construed to limit in any way the Estate Representative's rights under this
Agreement, including the Estate Representative's rights under Article 11 hereof,
or to limit the Estate Representative's rights to advocate for the approval of
this Agreement and against any alternative transaction or plan of reorganization
that does not effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                             COVENANTS OF THE BUYER

the contrary contained herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement, the


                                       29
<PAGE>
Confidentiality Obligations as they relate to the transactions contemplated by

transactions (as these terms are used in the Confidentiality Regulations) and
each party hereto (and any employee, representative, or agent of any party
hereto) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the
"tax structure" and "tax treatment" of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any materials of any kind (including any tax opinions or other tax
analyses) that relate to the "tax treatment" and "tax structure." In addition,
each party hereto acknowledges that it has no proprietary or exclusive rights to
any tax matter or tax idea related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The preceding sentence is intended to ensure that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall not to be treated as having been offered

           Section 6.02. Bankruptcy Court Approvals. (a) The Buyer shall assist
and cooperate with the Debtors in seeking approval of the Disclosure Statement
and confirmation of the Plan. The Buyer shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) file
any pleading or take other action in the Bankruptcy Court with respect to this
Agreement, the Plan or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby that is inconsistent with the full performance and implementation of
the provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing contained in

limit the Buyer's or its Affiliates' rights to advocate for the approval of this
Agreement and against any alternative transaction or plan of reorganization that
does not effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

           (b) All information concerning the Buyer provided in writing to the
Company by the Buyer expressly for inclusion in the Disclosure Statement is or
shall be accurate in all material respects. The Buyer shall promptly notify the
Company and the other Debtors if at any time before the Effective Date it

material fact with respect to the Buyer or omits to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained
therein with respect to the Buyer, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

           (c) If the Confirmation Order or any other Orders of the Bankruptcy
Court relating to (i) this Agreement, (ii) the Disclosure Statement, (iii) the
solicitation of acceptance of the Plan, or (iv) confirmation of the Plan, shall
be appealed by any party (or a petition for certiorari or motion for rehearing
or reargument shall be filed with respect thereto), the Buyer agrees to take
such steps, if any, as may be reasonable and appropriate to join in and
prosecute such appeal, petition or motion or defend against such appeal,
petition or motion and to use reasonable efforts to obtain an expedited
resolution of any such appeal, petition or motion, with the objective of
effecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that such
reasonable efforts obligation shall not obligate the Company to expend monies or
to pay a disputed claim against the Company.

                     COVENANTS OF THE BUYER AND THE COMPANY

           The Buyer and the Company agree that:

Agreement) at the Approval Hearing (as that term is defined in the Bid

until such time as the Bankruptcy Court shall have entered the Approval Order.

           (b) After entry of the Approval Order, the Shares shall not be
offered to any Person other than the Buyer unless the Buyer fails to perform its
material obligations under this Agreement.

           Section 7.02. Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the Buyer and the Company will use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary or desirable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and the
Buyer agree, and the Company, prior to the Closing, and the Buyer, after the
Closing, agree to cause the Company and each Subsidiary, to execute and deliver
such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and to take
such other actions as may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate or
implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If
following the Closing Date there exists any Lien upon any asset of the Company
that arose by operation of law and that relates to an Excluded Liability, the
Estate Representative shall, reasonably promptly upon notification thereof by
the Buyer, discharge such liability or otherwise cause such Lien to be released.

           Section 7.03. Certain Filings. (a) Promptly following the issuance of
the Approval Order, the Estates and the Buyer will each prepare and file a
notification with the United States Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission, as required by the HSR Act. The Estates and the Buyer will cooperate
with each other in connection with the preparation of such notification,
including sharing information concerning sales and ownership and such other
information as may be needed to complete such notification, and providing a copy
of such notification to the other prior to filing. Each of the Estates and the
Buyer will keep confidential all information about the other obtained in
connection with the preparation of such notification. In addition, each party
agrees to make promptly any filing that may be required under any other
antitrust or competition law or by any other antitrust or competition authority.
Buyer and Seller will cooperate to respond to all inquiries and requests for
further information associated with the HSR Act filing and any filing that may
be required under any other antitrust or competition law or by any other
antitrust or competition authority. The Buyer and the Estates shall each have
responsibility for one-half of the aggregate filing fees associated with the HSR
Act filings and any other similar filings required in any other jurisdictions.

           (b) The Estates and the Buyer shall cooperate with one another (i) in
determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority is required, or any actions, consents,


                                       31

approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material
contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (ii) in taking such actions or making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking timely to
obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

           Section 7.04. Public Announcements. The parties agree to consult with
each other before issuing any press release or making any public statement with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except
for any press releases and public statements the making of which may be required
by applicable law or any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation.

           Section 7.05. Supplementation and Amendment of Schedules.

           (a) From time to time prior to the Closing, the Company shall have

hereafter arising or discovered after the delivery of the Schedules pursuant to
this Agreement that, if existing or known at, or occurring prior to, the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such
Schedules. No such supplement or amendment shall have any effect on the
satisfaction of the condition to closing set forth in Section 9.02(a); provided,
however, if the Closing shall occur, then, unless otherwise agreed to in
writing, the Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any right or claim pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement or to otherwise with respect to any and all matters
disclosed pursuant to any such supplement or amendment and delivered to Buyer at
least two Business Days prior to the Closing. For purposes of clarity, from time
to time prior to the Closing, the Company shall supplement Schedule 3.11(a)(y)
to include any Contract rejected or to be rejected by the Company or the
Subsidiaries as contemplated by Sections 3.11 and 5.01, and the reference to
Schedule 3.11(a)(y) in Section 2.06(b) shall be deemed to be a reference to such
Schedule, as supplemented.

Agreement but at least 20 Business Days prior to the Effective Date (unless such
date is otherwise shortened by the Bankruptcy Court), the Buyer may give notice
to the Company that one or more executory Contracts listed in Schedule
3.11(a)(x) (and not assumed by the Company prior to July 31, 2003 or included in
the Schedule 3.11(a)(y) attached to this Agreement at July 31, 2003) should be
rejected by the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable, in which event:

                      (i) the Company or Subsidiary, as applicable, will file a
           motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking an order authorizing the
           rejection of the executory Contract(s) identified in the Buyer's
           notice;

                      (ii) the Company shall amend Schedules 3.11(a)(x) and
           3.11(a)(y), accordingly; and

                      (iii) the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount
           equal to the Rejected Contract Claims as provided in Section 2.03(g).

           Section 7.06. Preservation of and Access to Books and Records;
Cooperation. The Buyer agrees that, for a period of one year from the Closing
Date (or for such longer period of time not to exceed six (6) additional months
as the Estates may reasonably require), it shall cause the Company, without cost
or expense to the Estates, to (i) preserve and keep intact the Company's books


                                       32
<PAGE>

records, and the Company's officers, employees, consultants, agents,

reasonable times, upon reasonable prior notice, under reasonable circumstances
and as may be reasonably required by the Estates, in connection with the filing
of any Tax Returns pursuant to Section 8.02 hereof, the consummation of the
Plan, the resolution of all claims against the Company that are disputed by the
Company, the distribution of all funds to which creditors of the Company are
entitled under the Plan, the wind down of the Estates and the closing of the
Reorganization Cases, (iii) allow the Estates to make extracts and copies of
such books and records, (iv) provide office space for one person for the use of
the Estates (at a reasonable location and under reasonable circumstances) and
(v) cooperate reasonably, and cause its officers, employees, consultants,
agents, accountants, attorneys and other representatives to cooperate
reasonably, with the Estates in connection with the foregoing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Buyer shall be entitled to reasonable compensation for the
time expended by the Company's officers, employees, consultants, agents,
accountants, attorneys and other representatives if the time required to comply
with the foregoing covenants is unreasonably excessive.

           Section 7.07. Administrative Claim Bar Date. The Estates shall seek
and obtain an administrative claims bar date from the bankruptcy court (the
"ADMIN BAR DATE") with respect to any and all claims having priority for payment
from the Estates under Bankruptcy Code ss. 503 (other than claims for goods and
services provided to the Company in the ordinary course of business prior to the
Effective Date, compensation claims of employees under contract, professional
fees and expense claims and claims by parties seeking cure for executory
contracts and unexpired leases assumed pursuant to the Plan or Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code) (the "ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIM BAR DATE ORDER"), which Admin
Bar Date shall be set no later than thirty (30) days prior to Closing.
Immediately following the Admin Bar Date, the Buyer and Estates shall determine
which of the administrative claims filed against the Estates shall constitute
Assumed Liabilities.

by a Taxing Authority in the Reorganization Cases, all material Excluded Taxes

agreement or arrangement and has not assumed the Tax liability of any other
person under contract.

           (l) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted or would result,
separately or in the aggregate, in a payment that would not be fully deductible
as a result of Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code or any similar
provision of foreign, state, or local law.

           Section 8.02. Preparation of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.

           (a) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with this Agreement, if any, shall be borne equally by the Estates
and the Buyer; provided, however, that if any such Taxes are reflected as an


                                       34
<PAGE>
"accrued expense and other" liability in the calculation of the Final Working
Capital or arise as a result of Section 12.10, the Buyer shall be responsible
for all such Taxes. All Taxes referred to in this Section 8.02 shall be paid by
the Company when due, and the Company shall file, or cause to be filed, all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any such transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees. The
Estates or the Estate Representative shall promptly pay the portion of such
Taxes for which it is responsible pursuant to this Section 8.02(a) to the Buyer
after the Buyer furnishes the Estates or the Estate Representative with a copy
of the applicable Tax Return and any other supporting documentation.

           (b) Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns.

                      (i) The Company shall prepare and file, or cause to be
           prepared and filed, all Tax Returns for the Company and the
           Subsidiaries that are required to be filed on or prior to the Closing
           Date. The Company shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all Taxes
           shown due on such Tax Returns.

                      (ii) The Estates shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
           the Company's and each Subsidiary's Tax Returns for all taxable
           periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are required to
           be filed after the Closing Date. The Estates shall deliver copies of
           such Tax Returns to the Buyer for review and approval (such approval
           shall not be unreasonably withheld) at least twenty (20) days prior
           to the due date for filing such returns. The Estates shall be
           responsible for the payment of the portion of such Taxes shown due on
           such Tax Returns to the extent any such Taxes constitute Excluded
           Taxes and shall pay such amounts to Buyer within five (5) days prior
           to the due date for filing such Tax Returns. The Buyer shall cause
           the Company and the Subsidiaries to timely file such Tax Returns and
           to remit all Taxes shown due on such Tax Returns.

                      (iii) The Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
           each Straddle Period Return. The Buyer shall deliver copies of each
           Straddle Period Return to the Estates for review and approval (such
           approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) at least twenty (20)
           days prior to the due date for filing such return (accompanied, where
           appropriate, by an accounting for the portion of such Taxes that
           constitutes Excluded Taxes). The Estates shall be responsible for the
           portion of the Taxes shown due on such Tax Returns to the extent any
           such Taxes constitute Excluded Taxes and shall pay such amounts to
           Buyer within five (5) days of the due date for filing such Straddle
           Period Return and Buyer shall be responsible for the balance. The
           Buyer shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to timely file
           such Tax Returns and to remit all Taxes shown due on such Tax
           Returns.

                      (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a
           dispute arises (and is not resolved within ten (10) days prior to the
           due date of the Tax Return) with regard to the amount of Excluded
           Taxes that the Estates owe in respect of any Tax Return described in
           Section 8.02(b)(ii) or 8.02(b)(iii), the Estates shall pay to the
           Buyer the amount that the Estates believe is owing and the parties
           shall resolve their dispute through the Accounting Referee. The
           Accounting Referee's determination shall be final and binding on both
           parties and its expenses shall be borne equally by both parties.
           Within five (5) days following resolution of the dispute, any amounts
           determined to be due upon final resolution of the dispute shall be
           promptly paid.

<PAGE>
                      (v) To the extent permitted by applicable Law or the
           administrative practice of any Taxing Authority, the taxable year of
           the Company and each Subsidiary shall close as of the close of
           business on the Closing Date. The parties hereto, the Company and the
           Subsidiaries shall not take any position inconsistent with the
           preceding sentence on any Tax Return.

                      (vi) All Tax Returns described in this Section 8.02 shall
           be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice unless a past
           practice has been finally determined to be incorrect by the
           applicable Taxing Authority or a contrary treatment is required by
           applicable Tax Laws (or the judicial or administrative
           interpretations thereof).

                      (vii) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
           contrary, the Estates (and the Company and/or its Subsidiaries prior
           to the Closing) may take any actions necessary to reduce or eliminate
           Taxes for any Tax Returns described in Section 8.02(b)(i) or
           8.02(b)(ii) without the consent of the Buyer, including, but not
           limited to, the defense, compromise or settlement of any audit or any
           administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxes for periods
           prior to or ending on the Closing Date or filing an amended Tax
           Return to obtain a refund for an Excluded Tax; provided, however, if
           the Estates amend or agree to an audit adjustment on a Tax Return of
           the Company or its Subsidiaries for a period ending on or prior to
           the Closing Date and such amendment or adjustment affects the Tax
           liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries for a period after the
           Closing, then the Estates or the Estate Representative shall obtain
           the consent of the Buyer before filing such amendment or agreeing to
           such adjustment (such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld);
           provided, however, that in no event shall the Estates (or the Estate
           Representative) be required to obtain the consent of the Buyer (or
           the Company or its Subsidiaries after the Closing) to settle or
           compromise the IRS claim consistent with the terms of the IRS
           Stipulation attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Buyer, the Estates, the
           Estate Representative, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
           cooperate and take those actions necessary to reduce or eliminate
           Taxes for any Straddle Period Returns described in Section
           8.02(b)(iii). To the extent any of the foregoing requires action to
           be taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing
           Date, the Buyer, Company and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate with
           the Estates to realize the applicable tax benefit or reduction in
           Taxes, including the filing of amended Tax Returns (prepared by the
           Estates or the Estate Representative in the case of amendments to Tax
           Returns described in Section 8.02(b)(i) or 8.02(b)(ii)).

                      (viii) The Company and/or its Subsidiaries shall promptly
           pay to the Estates any refunds (including interest thereon) received
           in respect of Excluded Taxes (determined without regard to clause (w)
           in the definition of Excluded Taxes).

           Section 8.03. Closing Covenants.

           (a) Tax Sharing Agreements. Any tax sharing agreement with the
Company, its Subsidiaries and any other Person will have been terminated as of
the Closing Date and will have no further effect for any taxable year (whether
the current year, a future year, or a past year).

           (b) The Plan shall provide for the expeditious payment of all allowed
claims for Taxes and no deferral of payment under Section 1129(a)(9)(C) of the
Bankruptcy Code shall be sought.


                                       36
<PAGE>
           (c) Except as provided in Section 12.10 hereof, the Company shall not
cause any intercompany obligations of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries to be
eliminated prior to the Closing Date.

           Section 8.04. Tax Controversy.

           (a) The Estates shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
exclusively represent the interests of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries in
any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxes for all
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer agrees that it will
cooperate fully, and shall cause the Company and/or its Subsidiaries to
cooperate fully, with the Estates and their counsel in the defense against or
compromise of any claim in any such proceeding.

           (b) The Estates (or the Estate Representative) shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to jointly represent the interests of the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating
to Straddle Period Returns. Buyer agrees that it will cooperate fully, and shall
cause the Company and/or its Subsidiaries to cooperate fully, with the Estates
and their counsel in the joint defense against or compromise of any claim in any
such proceeding. Neither the Estates, on the one hand, nor the Buyer, on the
other hand, shall settle any dispute relating to a Tax liability attributable to
the Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be, for a Straddle Period Return
without the consent of the other; provided, however, that, if the Estates
propose to accept a settlement and the Buyer does not consent thereto, the
Estates' liability under Article X in respect of such Tax liability shall be
limited to the portion of the proposed settlement amount attributable to the
portion of such Straddle Period Return that constitutes an Excluded Tax. The
Estates and the Buyer shall each bear their own costs, fees and expenses paid to
third parties in the course of such proceeding.

           (c) If any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or
otherwise disputes or affects any Taxes for which the Estates are responsible
hereunder, the Buyer shall, promptly upon receipt by the Buyer, the Company or
the Subsidiaries of notice thereof, inform the Estates. The failure of Buyer to
timely forward such notification in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence shall not relieve the Estates of their obligation to pay such liability
for Taxes except and to the extent that the failure to timely forward such
notification actually prejudices the ability of the Estates to contest such
liability for Taxes or increases the amount of such Taxes.

                                    ARTICLE 9

                              CONDITIONS TO CLOSING

                          SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

           Section 10.01. Survival. The representations and warranties of the
parties hereto contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other
writing delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall survive the

                                       39
<PAGE>
Article 10 prior to such date against the party responsible for indemnification
hereunder (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY").

           Section 10.02. Indemnification of Buyer. The Plan shall provide that
the Estate Representative shall hold Buyer, and, from and after the Closing, the
Company, and the shareholders, directors, officers, successors, assigns, and
agents of each of them (the "BUYER INDEMNIFIED PERSONS"), harmless and indemnify
each of them from and against, and waives any claim for contribution or
indemnity with respect to, any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities,
expenses or costs ("LOSSES"), plus reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses
incurred in connection with Losses and/or enforcement of this Agreement, plus
interest from the date incurred through the date of payment at two percent above
the prime lending rate of Bank of America, N.A. from time to time prevailing (in
all, "INDEMNIFIED LOSSES") incurred or to be incurred by any of them ("BUYER
INDEMNIFIED LOSSES") to the extent resulting from or arising out of (i) any
breach or violation of the Company's representations, warranties, covenants, or
agreements contained in this Agreement or (ii) the Excluded Liabilities.

           Section 10.03. Indemnification of the Estate Representative. From and
after the Closing, the Buyer shall hold the Estate Representative and its
members, managers, directors, officers, successors, assigns, and agents (the
"ESTATE INDEMNIFIED PERSONS"), harmless and indemnify each of them from and
against, and waives any claim for contribution or indemnity with respect to, any
and all Indemnified Losses incurred or to be incurred by any of them ("ESTATE
INDEMNIFIED LOSSES") to the extent resulting from or arising out of (i) any
breach or violation of Buyer's representations, warranties, covenants, or
agreements contained in this Agreement or (ii) the Assumed Liabilities.

           Section 10.04. Limitations.

           (a) The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to recover
Buyer Indemnified Losses for breaches or violations of the Company's
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement unless such Buyer
Indemnified Losses exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate, and only to the extent
such Buyer Indemnified Losses exceed such amount, up to a maximum recovery of
$7,000,000 (plus any accrued interest in the Indemnity Account).

           (b) The Estate Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to recover
Estate Indemnified Losses for breaches or violations of Buyer's representations
or warranties contained in this Agreement unless such Estate Indemnified Losses
exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate, and only to the extent such Estate
Indemnified Losses exceed such amount, up to a maximum recovery of $7,000,000.

           (c) For purposes of this Article 10, "Buyer Indemnified Losses" and
"Estate Indemnified Losses" shall not include or be recoverable by any person to
the extent insurance proceeds have been recovered with respect to the
indemnified matter.

           Section 10.05. Notice of Claim. In the event that Buyer seeks
indemnification on behalf of a Buyer Indemnified Person, or the Estate
Representative seeks indemnification on behalf of an Estate Indemnified Person,
such party seeking indemnification (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall give written
notice to the Indemnifying Party specifying the facts constituting the basis for
such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted. The
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any non-disputed claim not more than
ten days after the Indemnified Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party
of such amount.

<PAGE>
           Section 10.06. Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons. If an
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because of a claim
asserted by any claimant (other than an indemnified person hereunder) ("THIRD
PERSON"), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt notice thereof after such assertion is actually known to the Indemnified
Party; provided, however, that the right of a person to be indemnified hereunder
in respect of claims made by a Third Person shall not be adversely affected by a
failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, to investigate, secure,
contest, or settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a "THIRD PERSON
CLAIM"), provided that the Indemnifying Party has unconditionally acknowledged
to the Indemnified Party in writing his or its obligation to indemnify the
persons to be indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third Person Claim; the
Indemnified Party may thereafter participate (but not control) the defense of
any such Third Person Claim with its own counsel at its own expense, unless
separate representation is necessary to avoid a conflict of interest, in which
case such representation shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnifying Party so acknowledges its obligation to indemnify, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party
for any reasonable costs of the defense the Indemnified Party had theretofore
incurred. If the Indemnifying Party does not so acknowledge its obligation to
indemnity and assume the defense of any such Third Person Claim, (a) the
Indemnified Party shall defend against such claim, provided that any settlement
of such claim shall require the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (b) the
Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) the defense of such
claim, with its own counsel at its own expense. The parties hereto shall make
available to each other all relevant information in their possession relating to
any such Third Person Claim and shall cooperate in the defense, negotiation or
settlement thereof.

           Section 10.07. Exclusive Remedy. The provisions of this Article 10
shall constitute the exclusive remedy of the parties hereto with respect to any
claims for Indemnified Losses resulting from or arising out of the provisions of
this Agreement which may be asserted after the Closing; provided, that the
foregoing shall not preclude any claim for fraud.

                                    ARTICLE 11

                                   TERMINATION

           Section 11.01. Grounds for Termination. This Agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

           (a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and the Buyer;

           (b) by Buyer on the Closing Date if the conditions to Buyer's
obligations to close shall not have been fulfilled, provided that Buyer is not
in breach of its obligations hereunder;

           (c) by the Company on the Closing Date if the conditions to the
Company's obligations to close shall not have been fulfilled, provided that the
Company is not in breach of its obligations hereunder;

           (d) by either the Company or the Buyer if the Closing shall not have
been consummated on or before October 31, 2003; provided that the Company and


                                       41
<PAGE>
the Buyer shall each have the right to extend such date by up to 30 days upon
notice given to the other party by October 31, 2003;

           (e) by either the Company or the Buyer if there shall be any law or
regulation that makes consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
illegal or otherwise prohibited or if consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby would violate any nonappealable final Order of any court or
governmental body having competent jurisdiction (other than the Bankruptcy
Court);

           (f) by either the Company or the Buyer if the Bankruptcy Court shall
have issued an Order which has become final and nonappealable restricting or
restraining in a material manner or enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making
illegal the effectuation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
by the Plan (including an Order denying confirmation of the Plan or confirming a
plan of reorganization other than the Plan); or

           (g) by the Buyer or the Company if the Plan is not approved by the
Bankruptcy Court.

           The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
