Contracts</U>.&rdquo; A complete and correct copy of each of the Company Contracts has been made available to Purchaser. Except
as would not reasonably be expected to be adverse to the Company in any material respect, each Company Contract is legal, valid,
binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms on the Company and, to the knowledge of Seller, each other party thereto,
and is in full force and effect, subject, as to enforceability, to Creditors&rsquo; Rights. Except as would not reasonably be expected
to be adverse to the Company in any material respect, the Company is not in breach or default under any Company Contract nor, to
the knowledge of Seller, is any other party to any such Company Contract in breach or default thereunder, and no event has occurred
that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder by the Company, or, to the knowledge
of Seller, any other party thereto. There are no disputes pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened with respect to any
Company Contract and the Company has not received any written notice of the intention of any other party to any Company Contract
to terminate for default, convenience or otherwise any Company Contract, nor to the knowledge of Seller, is any such party threatening
to do so, in each case except as has not been or would not reasonably be expected to be adverse to the Company in any material

any action or failed to take any action that (including with respect to the Transactions), with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a material breach or default under, or permit a termination of, any of the Company Insurance Policies.
As of the Execution Date, no written notice of cancellation or termination has been received with respect to any Company
Insurance Policy. From January 1, 2017 to the Execution Date, the Company has not received any written notice, or any other

reasonably likely to exhaust the applicable limit of liability.</P>

and cover geologic depths that include all of the Subject Formation(s) being replaced, (2) if the Company is the operator

Interest as the Company Lease being replaced and the other terms and conditions of the new leases shall be substantially
similar to the terms of the Company Leases being replaced, including substantially similar surface use restrictions
(provided, as to duration, a lease with at least a remaining three year paid-up primary term (from the Execution Date) shall
be deemed substantially similar to a Company Lease held by production), (5) Title Defects relating to a Net Revenue Interest
deficiency shall be cured with new leases with a Net Revenue Interest sufficient to cure such Title Defect, (6) Title Defects
relating to a Net Acre deficiency shall be replaced with new leases with Net Acres sufficient to cure such Title Defect and
(7) Title Defects relating to excess Working Interest shall be replaced with new leases with Working Interests sufficiently
low to cure such Title Defect, in each case as applicable, and/or (B) obtaining additional Net Acres or Net Revenue Interest
in a Company Lease to replace Allocated Value lost due to a Title Defect (&ldquo;<U>Replacement
Interests</U>&rdquo;) provided such Company Lease is located in the same governmental section in which the applicable Asset
affected by the Title Defect is located. To the extent new leases or interests utilized as Replacement Acreage or Replacement
Interests, respectively, contain interests in excess of the interest necessary to cure a given Title Defect, such excess
interest shall be accounted for as a Title Benefit (but only to the extent otherwise meeting the requirements of <U>Section

not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying party&rsquo;s obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that
the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual prejudice as a result of such failure. Subject to the provisions of this <U>Section
10.6</U>, the indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, which
must be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Third Party Claim which relates to any Damages indemnified against by it hereunder; <U>provided</U> that the indemnifying party

written notice of the assertion of such Third Party Claim (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) notify

not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Damages indemnified
against by it hereunder, fails to notify the indemnified party of its election as herein provided or contest its obligation to
indemnify the indemnified party for such Damages under this Agreement, the indemnified party may defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim. If the indemnified party defends any Third Party Claim, then the indemnifying party
shall reimburse the indemnified party for the reasonable expenses of defending such Third Party Claim upon submission of periodic
bills. If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at
his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that such indemnified party
shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party if (i) so
requested by the indemnifying party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified party a conflict
or potential conflict exists between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate representation
advisable; and provided, further, that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel (plus
any appropriate local counsel) for all indemnified parties in connection with any Third Party Claim. Each Party agrees to provide
reasonable access to the other Party to such documents and information as may reasonably by requested in connection with the defense,
negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this <U>Section 10.6</U> to the contrary,
neither the indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall, without the written consent of the other party, settle or compromise
any Third Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant (or claimants) and such party
provide to such other party an unqualified release from all liability in respect of the Third Party Claim. If the indemnifying
party makes any payment on any Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to
all rights and remedies of the indemnified party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the indemnified party with respect
to such Third Party Claim.</P>

or contribution pursuant to this <U>Article III</U> for any amount in excess of the net proceeds of the offering received by such

untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.</P>

will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company agrees that monetary damages would
not provide adequate compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this
Agreement and further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall
waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.</P>

any products or services that compete (directly or indirectly) with those of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (B) acquiring

books, contracts, instruments, computer data and other data and information (collectively, &ldquo;<B><I>Information</I></B>&rdquo;)
concerning the Company or any of its subsidiaries furnished to it or the Investor Directors by or on behalf of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries (except to the extent that such information can be shown by the party receiving such Information to have been

Portfolio Company, unless such Portfolio Company enters into a joinder agreement with the Company), or use such Information other
than in connection with evaluating and taking actions with respect to such Person&rsquo;s ownership interest in the Company. The
Company acknowledges and agrees that the Investor and EnCap may, in the ordinary course of their respective businesses, evaluate
investments in the energy industry and that they are actively seeking to invest in energy related projects in a variety of areas,
including the provision of fresh water and disposal of produced water in connection with oil and gas exploration and development
operations. The Company understands that the Investor, EnCap and the Investor Directors will retain certain mental impressions
of Information, which are indistinguishable from generalized industry knowledge. Accordingly, the Company agrees that, subject
to the terms of this Agreement, the Investor, EnCap and the Investor Directors are not precluded from pursuing investments solely
because of such retained mental impressions. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no provision of this
Agreement shall apply to any action taken independently by any Portfolio Company so long as the Investor or EnCap has not provided
such Portfolio Company with any Information. For purposes of clarification, no such Portfolio Company shall be deemed to have been
provided with Information solely as a result of the Investor, EnCap, any Investor Director or any Representative (whether such
Person has been provided with or has knowledge of Information) serving on the board of such Portfolio Company (provided that such
board member does not use Information in connection with the business of such Portfolio Company).</P>
