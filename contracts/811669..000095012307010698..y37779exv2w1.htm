 B. Buyer desires to purchase from Sellers, and Sellers desire to sell to Buyer, the Interests on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 In consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

  

1\. _PURCHASE AND SALE OF INTERESTS_  

   

 1.1 _Purchase and Sale of Interests_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Buyer agrees to purchase the Interests from Sellers, and Sellers agree to sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer, free and clear of all liens, charges, encumbrances, adverse rights or claims and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), all of their right, title and interest in and to the Interests. 

  

 1.2 _Consideration for Interests_. At the Closing and as consideration for Buyers purchase of the Interests, Buyer shall pay an aggregate amount of $183,700,000 in cash and assumed debt (the " _Purchase Price_ "), which Purchase Price is allocated among the Companies and the Sellers as set forth in _Exhibit A_, of which (a) $183,700,000 less Net Debt less the Escrow Amount shall be paid to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated in writing by Sellers prior to the Closing Date and (b) 7.5% of the Purchase Price, or $13,875,000.00 (the " _Escrow Amount_ _"_ ) shall be deposited with a mutually agreeable escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") pursuant to Section 1.3, which shall be held in escrow (including all interest and other income earned thereon) pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. As used herein, " _Net Debt_ " means the principal amount of the Companies indebtedness for money borrowed as of the Closing Date less the Companies aggregate cash and Cash Equivalents as of the Closing Date. As used herein, " _Cash Equivalents_ " means the intercompany receivable in the amount $1,900,000 owed to SLWC by Sunburst Vineyards, LLC, certificates of deposit, U.S. treasury securities, money market funds and other marketable securities but excludes trade receivables. Prior to the Closing, Buyer and the Companies shall agree to allocate the Purchase Price among the 

   ##### 

  

    

assets of the Companies in a manner consistent with the principles of Section
1060(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") for
all tax and accounting purposes for which such an allocation is relevant. 

  

 1.3 _Escrow_. On the Closing Date, the Sellers Representative, Buyer and the Escrow Agent shall enter into the Escrow Agreement, in substantially the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit B_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), and Buyer shall deposit the Escrow Amount in escrow at Closing, which shall be held in escrow pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 1.4 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the transactions contemplated herein (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place on the earliest practicable business day (the " _Closing Date_ ") after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 7 at 9:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP in San Francisco, California, or such other time or place as the parties may agree. 

  

 1.5 _Combination_. Prior to the Closing, one or more of the Sellers shall be permitted to transfer Interests in a Company to another Seller or to a newly created entity that will become a Seller under this Agreement.

 Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule of the Companies delivered to Buyer concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), each Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows: 

  

 2.1 _Corporate Organization_. 

  

 (a) Each Company is a limited partnership or limited liability company, as applicable, duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of California. Each Company has the limited liability company or partnership, as applicable, power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business currently conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (b) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means (i) a material adverse effect on the businesses, results of operations or financial condition of the Companies, taken as a whole or (ii) a material adverse effect on any Companys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred, there shall be excluded any effect on any Company the cause of which is (A) the negotiation (including activities relating to due diligence, but without prejudice to a determination whether matters disclosed by the due diligence activities might constitute a 

   ##### 

  

    

Company Material Adverse Effect), execution, delivery or public announcement
or the pendency of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
any actions taken in compliance herewith or otherwise with the written
consent of Buyer, including the impact thereof on the relationships of any
Company with its customers, suppliers, distributors, consultants, employees
or independent contractors or other third parties with whom any Company has
any relationship, (B) any breach of the representations and warranties in
this Agreement that, to the actual knowledge of Buyers representatives set
forth in Exhibit G, exists as of the date hereof, (C) any failure by any
Company to meet any projections or forecasts for any period ending (or for
which revenues or earnings are released) on or after the date hereof (without
prejudice to a determination whether the facts and circumstances underlying
such failure might constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect), (D) any
change in federal or state law, regulations, policies or procedures,
or interpretations thereof of general application, or generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ "), (E) changes generally affecting the
industries in which the Companies operate, (F) changes in economic conditions
(including changes in the prevailing interest rates) in the United States, in
any region thereof, or in any non-U.S. or global economy or (G) any attack on,
or by, outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism involving,
the United States, or any declaration of war by the United States Congress. 

  

 (c) The copies of the Operating Agreements, Partnership Agreements and other governing documents of the Companies which have previously been made available to Buyer are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. 

  

 2.2 _Capitalization_. 

  

 (a) Sellers own all of the issued and outstanding membership or partnership interests, as applicable, in the Companies. As of the date of this Agreement, no Company has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any additional interests or any other equity securities of such Company or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any interest in such Company. 

  

 (b) Except as set forth in Section 2.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no Company owns, directly or indirectly, any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable for, any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other similar business association or entity, excluding publicly traded securities in any public company held for investment by any Company and comprising less than five percent of the outstanding stock of such company acquired in the ordinary course of business. No Company owns, directly or indirectly, any equity or similar interest in any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other similar business association or entity representing 20% or more of the voting interests or 20% or more of the value of such association or entity.

To the extent Buyer elects to initiate or defend any action or proceeding that seeks to modify, prohibit or enjoin the purchase of the Interests or the terms thereof, Sellers shall, and shall cause each Company to, take all actions reasonably requested by the Buyer to contest such action or proceeding. 

  

 (b) Each of the Buyer and the Sellers shall file or cause to be filed as promptly as reasonably practicable with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), in each case pursuant to the HSR Act: (i) the notification and report form, if any, required for the transactions contemplated hereby, which form shall be filed not later than five (5) business days following the date of this Agreement; and (ii) any supplemental information requested in connection therewith, which information shall be filed as soon as reasonably practicable after the request therefor. Any such notification and report form and supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. 

  

 (c) Subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, Sellers and the Companies, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, each shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other reasonably may request in connection with its preparation of the notices and requests referred to in this Section 6.2 and any filing or approval process that is necessary under the HSR Act, foreign antitrust and competition law and any other applicable law.

 6.3 _Employees; Employee Benefit Plans_. 

  

 (a) The Companies and Sellers will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause each employee of a Company to continue in employment with the applicable Company through the Closing Date and to encourage each such employee to remain in employment with such Company thereafter. 

  

 (b) Subject to Section 6.3(c) below, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) give those employees who are, as of the Closing Date, employed by any Company (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer (collectively, the " _Buyer Plans_ ") for such Continuing Employees service with the applicable Company (or any predecessor entity) to the same extent recognized by such Company, and (ii) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any Buyer Plan that is a welfare benefit plan that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date, and (iii) provide credit under any such welfare plan for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenditures for the remainder of the coverage period during which any transfer of coverage occurs; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such service shall be recognized to the extent such recognition would result in the duplication of benefits. Buyer shall also recognize service with the applicable Company for benefit accrual purposes under any of Buyers vacation, sick, personnel leave and severance policies. 

  

 (c) In general, the Continuing Employees will begin to be covered under the Buyer Plans effective January 1, 2008. The Companies shall, at Buyers sole cost and expense, take all steps necessary to permit the Continuing Employees to continue to receive the health and welfare plan coverage under Company Benefit Plans that are in effect as of the date hereof for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2007. The Buyer intends, subject to reevaluation following completion of the due diligence process to its satisfaction, to merge the Code section 401(k) plan maintained by one or more of the Companies (" _Company_ _401(k)_ _Plan_ ") into the Buyers Code section 401(k) plan, effective not later than January 1, 2008. Toward this end, the Companies shall act in all respects in ways that can reasonably be expected to facilitate this goal. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 6(c), the Buyer reserves the right to require one or more of the Companies that maintain the Company 401(k) Plan to terminate such plan prior to the Closing Date. In 

   ##### 

  

    

this case, (i) the Buyer shall provide the Companies with written notice of
its decision as soon as practicable after Buyer completes its due diligence
with respect to the Company 401(k) Plan, (ii) the Companies agree to follow
such reasonable direction as the Buyer may provide with respect to the
termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, (iii) the Continuing Employees shall
be eligible for the Buyers 401(k) plan, subject to its usual terms and
conditions, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and
(iv) Buyers 401(k) plan shall permit (to the extent permitted under the
Company 401(k) Plan) the rollover of amounts distributed from the Company
401(k) Plan, including participant loans, if any. 

  

 (d) From and after the Closing Date, and subject to Section 6.3(c) and the immediately following sentence, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to the Continuing Employees compensation and benefit arrangements that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefit arrangements that are provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer. Subject to Section 6.3(c), as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause the Continuing Employees to commence participation in such Buyer Plans as are provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer. Buyer shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, pay or provide, as applicable, to each Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated during the twelve-month period following the Closing Date (other than those individuals identified in Section 2.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule as having an employment, change of control, severance or similar type of agreement) severance pay and benefits that a similarly situated employee of Buyer would receive under the applicable Buyer Plan that is a severance plan. 

  

 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.3 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any Continuing Employees, present or former employees or directors, consultants or independent contractors of any Company, Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or, on or after the Closing Date, any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 6.3) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent, from and after the Closing Date, the termination of employment of any individual Continuing Employee or, subject to the provisions of Section 6.3(a), any change in the employee benefits available to any Continuing Employee or the amendment or termination of any particular Buyer Plan in accordance with its terms. 

  

 6.4 _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) Each Company shall, and shall cause each of its officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it) (collectively, " _Company Representatives_ ") to, immediately cease any existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. No Company shall, and shall not 

   ##### 

  

    

authorize or permit any Company Representative to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
furnish or disclose to any Person non-public information with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) negotiate or engage in substantive discussions
with any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (iv) enter
into any agreement (whether or not binding) or agreement in principle with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (b) As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer relating to (i) the acquisition of more than a majority of the outstanding partnership or membership interests in, or any other voting securities of, any Company by any third party, (ii) a merger, consolidation, business combination, reorganization, equity exchange, sale of assets, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction which would result in any third party acquiring 25% or more of the fair market value of the assets of any Company, (iii) any other transaction which would result in a third party acquiring 25% or more of the fair market value of the assets of any Company immediately prior to such transaction (whether by purchase of assets, acquisition of partnership or membership interests or otherwise) or (iv) any combination of the foregoing. 

  

 6.5 _Tax Treatment_. For income tax purposes, the Buyer and the Sellers agree to treat the purchase of the Interests pursuant to this Agreement as a taxable purchase of the assets of the Companies by the Buyer and a taxable sale of partnership and membership interests by the Sellers (except in the case where the Interests of a Company are held by a single Seller in which case the purchase of the Interests in the Company will be treated as a taxable sale of assets by both the Seller and Buyer), unless otherwise required by a taxing authority. 

  

 6.6 _Transaction Taxes_. All transfer taxes, real estate conveyance taxes and sales/bulk sales/use or other transaction taxes applicable to the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers. The parties shall cooperate and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by any party to reduce any such taxes. 

  

 6.7 _Pre-Closing Tax Returns and Contests_. 

  

 (a) Sellers Representative shall be responsible for preparing and filing all Tax Returns with respect to the Companies for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date (a  _"Pre-Closing Tax Period"_ ). The parties hereto agree that the current tax period of the Companies that are taxed as partnerships for income tax purposes shall end on the Closing Date and, therefore, the income Tax Returns of the Companies with respect to the period up to and including the Closing Date shall be prepared and filed by the Sellers Representative. The cost of the preparation of such Tax Returns shall be paid by the Sellers. The Sellers Representative shall prepare such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past practices employed with respect to the Companies, and shall deliver such Tax Returns to Buyer at least ninety (90) days before such Tax Return is due to be filed. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of such Tax Returns to the Buyer by the Sellers Representative, Buyer shall cause the applicable 

   ##### 

  

    

Companies to execute and deliver such Tax Returns and pay any amounts due
thereon (subject to any rights to indemnification from the Sellers pursuant
to Section 9.2) to the Sellers Representative who shall file such Tax Returns
on or before the due dates thereof (with regard to applicable extensions). In
the event there is a dispute regarding the manner in which such Tax Returns
are prepared by the Sellers Representative that cannot be resolved by the
parties within ten (10) days, the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall
cause the affected Tax Return to be submitted for resolution to Deloitte and
Touche LLP ("Deloitte") which shall, within thirty (30) days after such
submission, deliver a report to Buyer and the Sellers Representative setting
forth the resolution of such disputed items and the adjustment, if any, to be
made to the Tax Return, and such Tax Return shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties. The fees and disbursements of Deloitte shall be
paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by the Sellers. The Companies shall
not amend any Tax Return or otherwise take any position with respect to Taxes
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period that could increase the Tax liability of the
Sellers without the consent of the Sellers Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 (b) After the Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly notify the Sellers Representative of a proposed adjustment, audit or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any of the Companies with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. In the case of an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Sellers Representative shall have the right but not the obligation at Sellers expense to participate in and control the conduct of such audit or proceeding. The Sellers Representative shall keep Buyer informed of the progress of any such audit or proceeding. If the Sellers Representative does not assume the defense of any such audit or proceeding, Buyer may defend the same in such manner as it may deem appropriate at its expense. Neither Buyer nor the Sellers Representative shall enter into any compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant to any audit or proceeding which would materially adversely affect the other party for such year or a subsequent year without the consent of the other party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer agrees to cooperate, and agrees to cause the Companies to cooperate, with Sellers Representative in any audit or proceeding that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. 

  

 6.8 _Section 2.9 Disclosure_.

 9.5 _Procedure for Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) An Indemnified Party shall give written notice (the " _Claim Notice_ ") of any Indemnification Claim (i) in the case of an Indemnification Claim against Buyer, to Buyer and (ii) in the case of an Indemnification Claim against Sellers, to the Sellers Representative, reasonably promptly, but in any event (A) prior to expiration of the Survival Period and (B) if such Indemnification Claim relates to the assertion against an Indemnified Party of any Claim by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Indemnified Party of written notice of a legal process relating to such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the failure or delay to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any obligation or liability that the Indemnifying Party may have to the Indemnified Party, unless, and then only to the extent that, the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend or resolve such Indemnification Claim is adversely affected thereby. Any such Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances on which the asserted Indemnification Claim is based and specify the amount of such Indemnification Claim if then ascertainable. 

  

 (b) If the Indemnifying Party admits in writing given to the Indemnified Party after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a Claim Notice that Losses identified in such Claim Notice constitute indemnifiable claims, the Indemnified Party shall, subject to the other terms of this Section 9, be paid the amount of the Losses related to such Indemnification Claim or the uncontested portion thereof. All other Indemnification Claims shall be resolved by Buyer and the Sellers Representative in accordance with either (A) a mutual agreement among Buyer and the Sellers Representative, which shall be memorialized in writing, or (B) the final decision of a court or other trier of fact. 

  

 (c) (i) Subject to Sections 9.5(d) and (e), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice given to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of a Claim Notice relating to a Third Party Claim, to assume the defense or handling of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys sole expense, in which case the provisions of Section 9.5(c)(ii) shall govern. 

  

 (ii) Under the circumstances specified in Section 9.5(c)(i), the Indemnifying Party shall select counsel to conduct the defense or handling of such Third Party Claim reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, agree to a settlement of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any Third Party Claim, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless the sole relief provided that is binding on the Indemnified Party is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, and the terms of the settlement or judgment are confidential pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and shall be entitled to participate in but not control the defense or handling of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. The Indemnified Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent may be granted or denied in the 

   ##### 

  

    

Indemnifying Parties sole discretion), agree to a settlement of any Third
Party Claim that is being defended and handled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 9.5(c)(ii). 

  

 (d) (i) If (A) the Indemnifying Party does not give written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice from the Indemnified Party of a Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense or handling of such Third Party Claim, (B) at any time the Indemnifying Party shall fail to carry out such defense or handling diligently after written notice to such effect that is not cured as soon as practicable thereafter, or (C) the Indemnified Party has reasonably determined, upon written advice of counsel, that having common counsel with the Indemnifying Party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, then the provisions of Section 9.5(d)(ii) shall govern. 

  

 (ii) Under the circumstances specified in Section 9.5(d)(i), the Indemnified Party may, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, select counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to defend or handle such Third Party Claim in consultation with the Indemnifying Party and in a manner that is reasonable under the circumstances; _provided_ , _that_ , the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party timely apprised of the status of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to a settlement of, or consent to the entry of any judgment to, such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent may be granted or denied in the Indemnifying Partys sole discretion. If the Indemnified Party defends or handles such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party and shall be entitled to participate in but not control the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. 

  

 9.6 _Procedures for Claims Against, and Distributions of, Funds Deposited With Escrow Agent_. 

  

 (a) At the time a Buyer Indemnified Party gives the Sellers Representative written notice of such Buyers Indemnified Partys indemnification claim pursuant to Section 9.4 or Section 9.5 (or at any time thereafter), Buyer shall make a written claim against the Escrow Amount (an " _Escrow Claim_ ") by delivering written notice of the same (the " _Escrow Claim Notice_ ") to the Escrow Agent as provided in the Escrow Agreement (in which event Buyer will provide a copy of such Escrow Claim Notice to the Sellers Representative). Upon receipt of an Escrow Claim Notice, the Escrow Agent will, as provided in the Escrow Agreement, segregate from the Escrow Amount into a separate account (the " _Pending Claims Account_ ") a portion of the Escrow Amount as necessary to satisfy and pay the amount of the Escrow Claim as stated in the Claim Notice and the Escrow Agent will only thereafter distribute any amounts so deposited to the Pending Claims Account in accordance with joint written instructions of Buyer and the Sellers Representative given to the Escrow Agent (a " _Joint Written Instruction_ ") or a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction which has not been appealed and for which the time to appeal has lapsed or expired (a " _Final Court Order_ ") as provided in the Escrow Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) On the sixth month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent will, as provided in the Escrow Agreement, distribute to Sellers one-half (1/2) of the Escrow Amount, less all amounts then segregated in the Pending Claims Account. On the twelve month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent will, as provided in the Escrow Agreement, distribute to Sellers all of the Escrow Amount that is not then segregated in the Pending Claims Account. Except as provided above, the Escrow Agent will only distribute the Escrow Amount, including all amounts at any time segregated in the Pending Claims Account, in accordance with a Joint Written Instruction or a Final Court Order.
