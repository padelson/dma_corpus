 **WHEREAS** , the board of directors of Merger Sub, by resolutions duly
adopted, has unanimously approved the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, has approved and declared advisable
this Agreement, and has resolved to recommend to its sole stockholder the
adoption of this Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that (i)

 **WHEREAS** , the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the premises, and of the

Parties hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I** ** 
THE MERGER; CLOSING; SURVIVING COMPANY**

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving company in the Merger
(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " **Surviving Company** "), and the
separate corporate existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger,
except as set forth in _Article II_. The Merger shall have the effects
specified in the DGCL.

 



 

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " **Closing** ") shall take
place (a) at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, 100 Northern Avenue, Boston,
Massachusetts 02210, as soon as reasonably practicable, and in no event later
than two (2) Business Days following the day on which the last to be satisfied
or waived of each of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall have been
satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement or (b) at such other
place and time and/or on such other date as the Company and Parent may
otherwise agree in writing (the date on which the Closing occurs, the "
**Closing Date** ").

 



 

1.3 _Effective Time_. Upon the Closing, the Company and Parent will cause a
Certificate of Merger with respect to the Merger (the " **Certificate of
Merger** ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as may
be agreed upon by the Parties in writing and set forth in the Certificate of
Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the " **Effective Time** ").

 



 

1.4 _The Certificate of Incorporation_. Subject to _Section 5.12(a)_, at the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be
amended and restated in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto and
as so amended and restated shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Company (the " **Certificate of Incorporation** "), until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



     

 

 



 

1.5 _The Bylaws_. Subject to _Section 5.12(a)_, at the Effective Time, the
bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated to conform to the bylaws
of Merger Sub (except that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be
replaced with the name of the Company) (the " **Bylaws** "), and as so amended
and restated shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Company until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

1.6 _Directors of the Surviving Company_. The Parties shall take all actions
necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of
the Surviving Company until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws; provided,
for the avoidance of doubt, that any such actions shall not affect the terms
of any individuals employment with the Company existing as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

1.7 _Officers of the Surviving Company_. The Parties shall take all actions
necessary so that the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of
the Surviving Company until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II** ** 
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON SECURITIES; EXCHANGE**

 



 

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub:

 



 

(i) _Merger Consideration_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub
or Shares held in treasury, if any (each such Share, an " **Excluded Share** "
and, collectively, " **Excluded Shares** ")) shall be automatically converted
into the right to receive 0.485 (the " **Exchange Ratio** ") validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, as
adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (the " **Merger Consideration** ").

 



 

(ii) At the Effective Time, all of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and (A) each certificate (a " **Certificate** ") formerly representing any of
the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and (B) each book-entry account
formerly representing any uncertificated Shares (" **Uncertificated Shares**
") (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, any distributions or dividends payable
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_, without
interest, in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.2_, in the case
of certificated Shares, and upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents
message" in customary form in accordance with _Section 2.2(i)_ in the case of
Uncertificated Shares.

 



 

(iii) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled
without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the
Surviving Company, and such converted shares shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company.

 



 

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent and Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as the exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " **Exchange
Agent** "). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the Companys
stockholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares
represented thereby. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence
of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_ in book-entry form equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration
(excluding any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section
2.2(e)_), and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient
to pay any dividends under _Section 2.2(c)_ and an amount of cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) (such evidence of book-
entry shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and cash amounts, together with
any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the " **Exchange
Fund** "), in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of Shares. In the
event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay any dividends under
_Section 2.2(c)_, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly
deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal
to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery
of the Merger Consideration, any amounts payable in respect of dividends or
other distributions on shares of Parent Class A Common Stock in accordance
with _Section 2.2(c)_ out of the Exchange Fund and any amount of cash in lieu
of fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ in accordance with
this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is
not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash shall in all events
be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations
fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in
commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc.
or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares entitled to receive such amounts pursuant to this
_Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable pursuant to this _Article II_ shall be paid to the Surviving
Company no later than one (1) year after the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Exchange Agent shall mail to
each holder of record of Shares represented by a Certificate (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) or Uncertificated Shares (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in _Section 2.2(g)_) or Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent,
such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for
surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(g)_) or Uncertificated Shares
(including instructions for

 



     

 

 



 

sending an "agents message" in customary form (or such other evidence, if
any, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request)) to the Exchange Agent.
Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the
Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(g)_) to the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal or with respect to
Uncertificated Shares, receipt of an "agents message" in customary form (or
such other evidence, if any, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) by
the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash amounts and one or more
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock which shall represent, in the aggregate,
the whole number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.2(h)_. The Certificate or
Uncertificated Share so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Uncertificated Share. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, cash
amounts and the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be paid and exchanged
upon due surrender of the Certificate or Uncertificated Share pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a) _may be paid and issued to such transferee if the Certificate
formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or
other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Class A
Common Stock, the record date for which is after the Effective Time, that
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable in the Merger. No dividends or
other distributions in respect of the Parent Class A Common Stock issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Uncertificated Share until such Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.2(g)_) or Uncertificated Share
is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to
the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.2(g)_) or
Uncertificated Share, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the
whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest thereon, (A) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and
not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time, but with a payment
date subsequent to surrender.

 



 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. The Exchange Agent, acting as agent for the
holders of Shares otherwise entitled to receive fractional shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock, will aggregate all fractional shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock that would otherwise have been required to be distributed and
cause them to be sold in the open market for the accounts of such holders.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Shares
who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Parent Class A Common Stock shall receive, in

 



     

 

 



 

lieu thereof, cash, rounded to the nearest whole cent and without interest, in
an amount equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the closing
price of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock on the trading day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, less any applicable transfer Taxes.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for one hundred eighty (180) days
after the Effective Time shall be delivered, at Parents option, to Parent.
Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for
delivery of any shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and payment of cash in
lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and other distributions in respect
of the Parent Class A Common Stock to be issued or paid pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_ (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.2(h)_) upon due surrender of its
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in
_Section 2.2(g)_) or Uncertificated Shares, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Company, Parent, Exchange
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. To the fullest extent permitted
by Law, immediately prior to the date any Merger Consideration would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, such Merger
Consideration shall become the property of the Surviving Company, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange
Agent, as applicable, may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the cash in
lieu of fractional shares, shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and any
dividends and other distributions in respect of the Parent Class A Common
Stock that would have been issuable or payable pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_ (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.2(h)_) had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
been surrendered.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company and the
Exchange Agent (each, a " **Withholding Agent** ") shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld by the applicable Withholding Agent, such deducted or withheld
amounts (i) shall be timely remitted by such Withholding Agent, to the
applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law and (ii) to
the extent so remitted, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by such Withholding Agent.

 



 

(i) _Uncertificated Shares_. Any holder of Uncertificated Shares shall not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section
2.2(e)_ that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article II_
in respect of such Uncertificated Shares. In lieu thereof, each registered
holder of one or more Uncertificated Shares whose Shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any distributions or dividends
payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_,
shall, upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of an

 



     

 

 



 

"agents message" in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and the
Surviving Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock payable
pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ for each Uncertificated Share, and the
Uncertificated Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any amount payable to a holder of Uncertificated
Shares.

 



 

2.3 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for any such Shares, or Parent changes the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for any such Parent Class A Common Stock, in each case issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, subdivision, or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such
event on the Merger Consideration.

 



 

2.4 _Treatment of Equity Awards and ESPP_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than a Company
Option covered by _Section 2.4(b)_ and _Section 2.4(c)_) shall, without any
action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, cease to
represent a right to acquire Shares and shall be assumed and converted
automatically into an option to purchase the number of shares of Parent Class
A Common Stock (each, an " **Adjusted Option** ") equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the number of Shares subject to the Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, with any
fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole share. Each Adjusted
Option shall have an exercise price per share of Parent Class A Common Stock
equal to (x) the per share exercise price for Shares subject to the
corresponding Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided
by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each Adjusted
Option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable
to the corresponding Company Option under the applicable Company Stock Plans
and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting terms.

 



 

(b) On the Business Day immediately following Closing, each Company UK Option
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than a Company UK Option covered by _Section 2.4(c)_) shall, provided
the holder thereof has so agreed on or prior to the Business Day prior to the
Closing Date (absent which agreement, such Company UK Option shall lapse as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time), cease to represent a right to
acquire the Shares and shall be assumed and converted automatically into an
Adjusted Option on the terms set forth in _Section 2.4(a)_ above. The Company
and Parent shall take commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any
replacement of a Company UK Option hereunder shall satisfy paragraph 27 of
Schedule 4 to the UK Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company Option held by any former
employee or former service provider of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled without the payment of any consideration and each
vested Company Option held by any former employee or former service provider
of the Company or a Company Subsidiary that is outstanding and unexercised as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the
part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted
into a right to receive the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
equal to (i) the number of Shares subject to the Company Option immediately

 



     

 

 



 

prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the excess, if any, of (x) the
Company Share Value over (y) the per share exercise for Shares subject to the
corresponding Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided
by (ii) the Company Share Value multiplied by (iii) the Exchange Ratio, with
any fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole share.

 



 

(d) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU (other than a Company RSU covered
by _Section 2.4(e)_) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not vested or issuable, shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
assumed and converted automatically into a restricted stock unit with respect
to a number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock (each, an " **Assumed
RSU** ") equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total number of
Shares subject to the Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by
(ii) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the
nearest whole share. Each Assumed RSU shall otherwise be subject to the same
terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding Company RSU under the
applicable Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing grants
thereunder, including vesting terms.

 



 

(e) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU held by a current or former non-
employee director of the Company shall, without any action on the part of
Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into a
right to receive the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock equal to
(i) the number of Shares subject to the Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional
shares rounded down to the nearest whole share.

 



 

(f) _Further Action_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the
Company Board shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are

standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the
case of good standing, to the extent such jurisdiction recognizes such

other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not

"). Other than as contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Company nor any

(a) The Company has furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including exhibits and other information
incorporated therein) required to be furnished or filed by the Company with
the SEC since November 14, 2017 (such documents, together with any documents
filed with the SEC during such period by the Company on a voluntary basis on a
Current Report on Form 8-K, being collectively referred to as the " **Company
SEC Documents** ").

 



 

(b) Each Company SEC Document (i) at the time filed, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of SOX and the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Document and (ii) did not at the
time it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or amendment prior
to the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing or amendment)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each of the consolidated financial statements of the Company
included in the Company SEC Documents complied at the time it was filed as to
form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared
in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as

periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments).

contingent or otherwise) that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For

 



     

 

 



 

purposes of this _Section 3.6_, the term "liabilities" shall not include
liabilities or obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to perform
under or comply with any applicable Law, action, Judgment or Contract, but
would include such liabilities and obligations if there has been a default or
failure to perform or comply by the Company or any Company Subsidiary with any
such liability or obligation if such default or failure would, with the giving
of notice or passage of time or both, reasonably be expected to result in a
monetary obligation or the imposition of injunctive or other equitable
remedies.

 



 

3.7 _Internal Controls and Procedures_.

 



 

(a) Each of the chief executive officer of the Company and the chief financial
officer of the Company (or each former chief executive officer of the Company

Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the Company SEC
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and

or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Companys properties or assets.

 



 

(c) The Company is, and since November 14, 2017 has been, in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and requirements of the NYSE.

 



 

(d) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by the Company are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all
such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to
the management of the Company to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of the Company to make the certifications required under the Exchange
Act with respect to such reports.

 



 

(e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the
Companys or such Company Subsidiarys published financial statements.

 



     

 

 



 

3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes_. From January 1, 2018 to the date of this
Agreement, there has not occurred any Effect that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, and except for actions taken in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of
business in all material respects. From June 30, 2018 to the date of this
Agreement, except for actions taken in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, there have not been any actions taken that are restricted pursuant
to _Section 5.1(a)(i)_ through _(xviii)_ (if taken after the date of this
Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent) and would constitute a
violation of _Section 5.1(a)_.

 



 

3.9 _Litigation and Liabilities_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is
no suit, action or other proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of

injunctive relief that would be material to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Judgment
outstanding against or, to the Knowledge of the Company, investigation by any
Governmental Entity involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of

(c) All Company Plans are, and have been operated and administered, in
compliance with their terms and applicable Laws (including, if applicable,
ERISA and the Code), except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company
Plan that constitutes in any part a nonqualified deferred compensation plan
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (each, a " **NQDC Plan** ") has
been operated and maintained in all material respects in compliance with
Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder and no payment to
be made under any Company Plan is, or to the Knowledge of the Company, will
be, subject to the penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

 



 

(d) Each Company Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code, has received a favorable determination letter or opinion letter from
the Internal Revenue Service (the " **IRS** ") and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, circumstances do not exist that are likely to result in the loss of
the qualification of such plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Each non-U.S.

 



     

 

 



 

Company Plan, to the extent required to be registered or approved by any
Governmental Entity, has been registered with, or approved by, such
Governmental Entity and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred
that would adversely affect such registration or approval.

 



 

(e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any entity which is
considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code (each, an " **ERISA Affiliate** ") has, within the
past six (6) years, maintained or contributed to, or has, within the past six
(6) years, been obligated to maintain or contribute to (i) an "employee
pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to Title

"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section (3)(37) of ERISA), (ii) a
"multiple employer plan" as defined in Section 413(c) of the Code or (iii) a
"multiple employer welfare arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of
ERISA.

 



 

(f) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
proceedings relating to the Company Plans or to any fiduciary or service
provider thereof in connection with such fiduciarys or service providers
provision of services to the Company Plans.

 



 

(g) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby could reasonably be expected to,
either alone or in combination with any other event, (i) result in any
material payment becoming due to any employee, officer, director or other
service provider of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) materially

respects with the requirements of SOX and the Exchange Act or the Securities

contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,

expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
_Section 4.5_, the term "liabilities" shall not include liabilities or
obligations of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to perform under or comply with
any applicable Law, action, Judgment or Contract, but would include such
liabilities and obligations if there has been a default or failure to perform

material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and requirements of the NYSE.

 



 

(d) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Parent are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Parent to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
and to enable the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
Parent to make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect
to such reports.

 



 

(e) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of
the Parent Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of

5.2 _Company Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_, except as expressly
permitted by this _Section 5.2_, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall cause its and its Subsidiaries
directors, officers and employees not to, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors, agents or representatives (collectively, along
with such directors, officers and employees, " **Representatives** ") not to,
directly or indirectly:

 



 

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly induce, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations or cooperate in any way
not permitted by this _Section 5.2_ with any Person regarding any proposal
the consummation of which would constitute a Company Acquisition Proposal;

 



     

 

 



 

(iii) provide any information or data concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with any proposal the consummation of
which would constitute a Company Acquisition Proposal; or

 



 

(iv) approve or recommend, make any public statement approving or
recommending, or enter into any agreement relating to, any inquiry, proposal
or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Company Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

The Company shall, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Company Acquisition Proposal, or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly
terminate access by any such Person to any physical or electronic data rooms
relating to any such Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not grant
any waiver of, or agree to any amendment or modification to, any "standstill"
agreement, to permit such Person to submit a Company Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not restrict the Company from permitting a
Person to orally and non-publicly request the waiver of a "standstill" or
similar obligation or from granting such a waiver, in each case, to the extent
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 



 

(b) _Fiduciary Exception to No Solicitation Provision_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in _Section 5.2(a)_, prior to the time, but not
after, the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company may, in
response to an unsolicited, written Company Acquisition Proposal (which
Company Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement) which
did not result from a breach, in any material respect, of this _Section 5.2_,
(i) contact the Person or group of Persons making such Company Acquisition
Proposal to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and inform such Person or
group of Persons of the terms of this _Section 5.2_, (ii) provide access to
non-public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the
Person who made such Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided that_ such
information has previously been made available to Parent or is provided to
Parent substantially concurrently with the making of such information
available to such Person and that, prior to furnishing any such material non-
public information, the Company receives from the Person making such Company
Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms at least
as restrictive in all material respects on such Person as the Confidentiality
Agreements terms are on Parent (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not prohibit the making or amending of a Company Acquisition
Proposal) and (iii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with any such Person regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal if, and only
if, prior to taking any action described in clause (ii) or (iii) above, the
Company has provided prior written notice to Parent and the Company Board
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that
(A) based on the information then available and after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation that such Company
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior Proposal and (B) the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(c) _Notice_. The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1)
Business Day) notify Parent if (i) any written or other inquiries, proposals
or offers with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries,
proposals, offers or requests for information relating to or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal are received
by the Company, (ii) any non-public information is requested in connection
with any Company Acquisition Proposal from the Company or (iii) any
discussions or negotiation with respect to or that could

 



     

 

 



 

reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal are sought to
be initiated or continued with the Company, indicating, in connection with
such notice, the name of such person and a summary of the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (including of any written requests,
proposals or offers, including proposed agreements and other material written
communications), and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers
(including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations, including by promptly providing copies of any additional
requests, proposals or offers, including any drafts of proposed agreements and
amendments thereto.

" **Company Acquisition Proposal** " means any proposal (other than a proposal
or offer by Parent or any of its subsidiaries) for (i) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance of securities,
direct or indirect acquisition of securities, recapitalization, tender offer,
exchange offer or other similar transaction in which (x) a person or "group"
(as defined in the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) of
persons directly or indirectly acquires, or if consummated in accordance with
its terms would acquire, beneficial or record ownership of securities
representing more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares of any
class of voting securities of the Company; or (y) the Company issues
securities representing more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding
shares of any class of voting securities of the Company; (ii) any direct or
indirect sale, lease, exchange, transfer, acquisition or disposition of any
assets of the Company and of the subsidiaries of the Company that constitute
or account for (x) more than twenty percent (20%) of the consolidated net
revenues of the Company, consolidated net income of the Company or
consolidated book value of the Company; or (y) more than twenty percent (20%)
of the fair market value of the assets of the Company; or (iii) any
liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

 



 

" **Company Intervening Event** " means any event, occurrence, fact,
condition, change, development or effect that (i) was not known to, or
reasonably foreseeable by, the Company Board prior to the execution of this
Agreement, which event, occurrence, fact, condition, change, development or
effect becomes known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Company Board prior
to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and (ii) does not relate to
(A) a Company Acquisition Proposal or (B) (1) any changes in the market price
or trading volume of the Company or Parent or (2) the Company or Parent
meeting, failing to meet or exceeding published or unpublished revenue or
earnings projections, in each case in and of itself (it being understood that

Company Acquisition Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of
Company Acquisition Proposal increased to eighty percent (80%)) on terms which
the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, would reasonably be expected to be consummated in accordance with
its terms, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of
the proposal and the Person or group of Persons making the proposal, and, if
consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger (after taking into
account any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.2(f)_ of this Agreement and the time likely
to be required to consummate such Company Acquisition Proposal).

 



 

(e) _No Company Change in Recommendation or Company Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_. Except as provided in _Section 5.2(f)_ and _Section 5.2(g)_, the
Company Board and each committee of the Company Board shall not (i) withhold,

manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or approve,
recommend or otherwise declare advisable (or publicly propose or resolve to
approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable) any Company Acquisition
Proposal or make or authorize the making of any public statement (oral or
written) that has the substantive effect of such a withdrawal, qualification
or modification (each, a " **Company Change in Recommendation** ") or (ii)
cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture

in compliance with _Section 5.2(a)_) relating to any Company Acquisition
Proposal or requiring the Company (or that would require the Company) to
abandon, terminate, or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (a " **Company Alternative Acquisition
Agreement** ").

 



 

(f) _Fiduciary Exception to No Company Change in Recommendation Provision_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.2(e)_,
following receipt of an unsolicited, written Company Acquisition Proposal by
the Company after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a
material breach of this _Section 5.2_ and with respect to which the Company
has received a written, definitive form of Company Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, and the Company Board determining in good faith, after consultation
with financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal, the Company Board may, at any time prior to the time the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, make a Company Change in Recommendation with
respect to such Company Superior Proposal, if all of the following conditions
are met:

 



 

(i) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with the
provisions of this _Section 5.2_ and shall have (A) provided to Parent four
(4) Business Days prior written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that
it has received a written Company Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a
Company Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the
Company Acquisition Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and
the identity of the Person or group making the Company Acquisition Proposal),
and shall have contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the Company
Alternative Acquisition Agreement and all other documents related to the
Company Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to the financial terms or any other material term or condition of such Company
Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional two (2)
Business Day period) and (3) that, subject to clause (ii) below, the Company
Board has determined to hold a meeting at which it intends to effect a Company
Change in Recommendation, and (B) prior to making such a Company Change in
Recommendation, (x) engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent (to the
extent Parent wishes to engage) during such notice period to consider
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement which may be
proposed in writing by Parent such that the Company Alternative Acquisition
Agreement ceases to constitute a Company Superior Proposal, and (y) in
determining whether to make a Company Change in Recommendation, the Company
Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent; and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Company Superior Proposal and
taking into account any revised terms proposed in writing by Parent, such
Company Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal
and, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to

 



     

 

 



 

make such Company Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(g) _Company Change in Recommendation Due to Company Intervening Event_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.2(e)_, upon
the occurrence of any Company Intervening Event, the Company Board may, at any
time prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, make a
Company Change in Recommendation, if all of the following conditions are met:

prior written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the Company Intervening Event and the rationale for the
Company Change in Recommendation, and (2) state expressly that, subject to
clause (ii) below, the Company Board has determined to hold a meeting at which
it intends to effect a Company Change in Recommendation and (B) prior to
making such a Company Change in Recommendation, engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to engage) during such
four (4) Business Day period to consider adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement which may be proposed in writing by Parent in
such a manner that the failure of the Company Board to make a Company Change
in Recommendation in response to the Company Intervening Event in accordance
with clause (ii) below would no longer be reasonably expected to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel, that in light of such Company Intervening Event and taking into
account any revised terms proposed in writing by Parent, the failure to make a
Company Change in Recommendation, would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(h) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard to a
Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that any "stop look and listen"
communication to its stockholders of the nature contemplated by Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act shall include an affirmative statement to the effect
that the recommendation of the Company Board is affirmed or remains unchanged;
_provided_ , _further_ , that this _Section 5.2(h)_ shall not be deemed to
permit the Company or the Company Board to effect a Company Change in
Recommendation except in accordance with _Sections 5.2(f)_ or _5.2(g)_.

 



 

5.3 _Parent Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_, except as expressly
permitted by this _Section 5.3_, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries

and employees not to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

 



 

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly induce, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Parent Acquisition Proposal;

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations or cooperate in any way
not permitted by this _Section 5.3_ with any Person regarding any proposal
the consummation of which would constitute a Parent Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(iii) provide any information or data concerning Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with any proposal the consummation of
which would constitute a Parent Acquisition Proposal; or

 



 

(iv) approve or recommend, make any public statement approving or
recommending, or enter into any agreement relating to, any inquiry, proposal
or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Parent Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

Parent shall, and Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions and negotiations
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Parent Acquisition
Proposal, or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly terminate access by any such Person
to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to any such Parent
Acquisition Proposal. Parent shall not grant any waiver of, or agree to any
amendment or modification to, any "standstill" agreement, to permit such
Person to submit a Parent Acquisition Proposal; _provided that_ the foregoing
shall not restrict Parent from permitting a Person to orally and non-publicly
request the waiver of a "standstill" or similar obligation or from granting
such a waiver, in each case, to the extent the Parent Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(b) _Fiduciary Exception to No Solicitation Provision_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in _Section 5.3(a)_, prior to the time, but not
after, the Parent Stockholder Approval is obtained, Parent may, in response to
an unsolicited, written Parent Acquisition Proposal (which Parent Acquisition
Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement) which did not result from
a breach, in any material respect, of this _Section 5.3_, (i) contact the
Person or group of Persons making such Parent Acquisition Proposal to clarify
the terms and conditions thereof and inform such Person or group of Persons of
the terms of this _Section 5.3,_ (ii) provide access to non-public
information regarding Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the Person who made
such Parent Acquisition Proposal; _provided that_ such information has
previously been made available to the Company or is provided to the Company
substantially concurrently with the making of such information available to
such Person and _that_ , prior to furnishing any such material non-public
information, Parent receives from the Person making such Parent Acquisition
Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms at least as
restrictive in all material respects on such Person as the Confidentiality
Agreements terms are on the Company (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amending of a Parent
Acquisition Proposal) and (iii) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any such Person regarding such Parent Acquisition Proposal
if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in clause (ii) or (iii)
above, Parent has provided prior written notice to the Company and the Parent
Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel
that (A) based on the information then available and after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation that such Parent
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Superior Proposal and (B) the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(c) _Notice_. Parent shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1)
Business Day) notify the Company if (i) any written or other inquiries,
proposals or offers with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiries, proposals, offers or requests for information relating to or that

 



       
 

 



 

could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal are
received by Parent, (ii) any non-public information is requested in connection
with any Parent Acquisition Proposal from Parent or (iii) any discussions or
negotiation with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Parent Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with
Parent, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such person
and a summary of the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers
(including of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements and other material written communications), and thereafter shall
keep the Company reasonably informed, on a current basis, of the status and
terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and
the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including by promptly
providing copies of any additional requests, proposals or offers, including
any drafts of proposed agreements and amendments thereto.

 



 

(d) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" **Parent Acquisition Proposal** " means any proposal (other than a proposal
or offer by the Company or any of its subsidiaries) for (i) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance of securities,
direct or indirect acquisition of securities, recapitalization, tender offer,
exchange offer or other similar transaction in which (x) a person or
"group"(as defined in the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder)

with its terms would acquire, beneficial or record ownership of securities
representing more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares of any
class of voting securities of Parent; or (y) Parent issues securities
representing more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares of any
class of voting securities of Parent; (ii) any direct or indirect sale, lease,
exchange, transfer, acquisition or disposition of any assets of Parent and of
the subsidiaries of Parent that constitute or account for (x) more than twenty
percent (20%) of the consolidated net revenues of Parent, consolidated net
income of Parent or consolidated book value of Parent; or (y) more than twenty
percent (20%) of the fair market value of the assets of Parent; or (iii) any
liquidation or dissolution of Parent.

 



 

" **Parent Intervening Event** " means any event, occurrence, fact, condition,
change, development or effect that (i) was not known to, or reasonably
foreseeable by, the Parent Board prior to the execution of this Agreement,
which event, occurrence, fact, condition, change, development or effect
becomes known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Parent Board prior to the
receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval and (ii) does not relate to (A) any
changes in the market price or trading volume of Parent or the Company, (B)
the Company or Parent meeting, failing to meet or exceeding published or

Acquisition Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Parent

outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
would reasonably be expected to be consummated in accordance with its terms,
taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
proposal and the Person or group of Persons making the proposal, and, if
consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger (after taking into
account any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.3(f)_ of this Agreement and the time likely
to be required to consummate such Parent Acquisition Proposal).

 



     

 

 



 

(e) _No Parent Change in Recommendation or Parent Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_. Except as provided in _Section 5.3(f)_ and _Section 5.3(g)_, the

(f) _Fiduciary Exception to No Parent Change in Recommendation Provision_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.3(e)_,
following receipt of an unsolicited, written Parent Acquisition Proposal by
Parent after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a material
breach of this _Section 5.3_ and with respect to which Parent has received a
written, definitive form of Parent Alternative Acquisition Agreement, and the
Parent Board determining in good faith, after consultation with financial
advisors of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that
such Parent Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal, the
Parent Board may, at any time prior to the time the Parent Stockholder
Approval is obtained, make a Parent Change in Recommendation with respect to
such Parent Superior Proposal, if all of the following conditions are met:

 



 

(i) Parent shall have complied in all material respects with the provisions of
this _Section 5.3_ and shall have (A) provided to the Company four (4)
Business Days prior written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that it
has received a written Parent Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Parent
Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Parent
Acquisition Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the
identity of the Person or group making the Parent Acquisition Proposal), and
shall have contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the Parent
Alternative Acquisition Agreement and all other documents related to the
Parent Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term or condition of such Parent
Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional two (2)
Business Day period) and (3) that, subject to clause (ii) below, the Parent
Board has determined hold a meeting at which it intends to effect a Parent
Change in Recommendation, and (B) prior to making such a Parent Change in
Recommendation, (x) engaged in good faith negotiations with the Company (to
the extent the Company wishes to engage) during such notice period to consider
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement which may be
proposed in writing by the Company such that the Parent Alternative
Acquisition Agreement ceases to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal, and (y)
in determining whether to make a Parent Change in Recommendation, the Parent
Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by the Company; and

 



 

(ii) the Parent Board shall have determined, in good faith, after consultation
with financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Parent Superior Proposal and taking into
account any revised terms proposed in writing by the Company, such Parent
Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Parent Superior

 



     

 

 



 

Proposal and, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure
to make such Parent Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(g) _Parent Change in Recommendation Due to Parent Intervening Event_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.3(e)_, upon
the occurrence of any Parent Intervening Event, the Parent Board may, at any
time prior to the time the Parent Stockholder Approval is obtained, make a
Parent Change in Recommendation, if all of the following conditions are met:

 



 

(i) Parent shall have (A) provided to the Company four (4) Business Days
prior written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the Parent Intervening Event and the rationale for the
Parent Change in Recommendation, and (2) state expressly that, subject to
clause (ii) below, the Parent Board has determined hold a meeting at which it
intends to effect a Parent Change in Recommendation and (B) prior to making
such a Parent Change in Recommendation, engaged in good faith negotiations
with the Company (to the extent the Company wishes to engage) during such four
(4) Business Day period to consider adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement which may be proposed in writing by the Company in such a
manner that the failure of the Parent Board to make a Parent Change in
Recommendation in response to the Parent Intervening Event in accordance with
clause (ii) below would no longer be reasonably expected to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

 



 

(ii) the Parent Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel, that in light of such Parent Intervening Event and taking into
account any revised terms proposed in writing by the Company, the failure to
make a Parent Change in Recommendation, would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(h) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_
shall be deemed to prohibit Parent from complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal; _provided that_ any "stop look and listen" communication
to its stockholders of the nature contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act shall include an affirmative statement to the effect that the
recommendation of the Parent Board is affirmed or remains unchanged;
_provided_ , _further_ , that this _Section 5.3(h)_ shall not be deemed to
permit Parent or the Parent Board to effect a Parent Change in Recommendation,
except in accordance with _Sections 5.3(f)_ or _5.3(g)_.

 



 

5.4 _Information Supplied_. The Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and
cause to be filed with the SEC a joint proxy statement (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the " **Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus** "
**)** with respect to the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent
Stockholders Meeting. As promptly as practicable (but in any event no more
than forty-five (45) days) following the date of this Agreement, Parent shall
prepare (with the Companys reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended or supplemented from time to
time, the " **Form S-4**"), in which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under
the Securities Act of the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be issued
in the Merger. Prior to the Form S-4 being declared effective, (1) the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver to Companys
Counsel and to Parents Counsel the applicable "Tax Representation Letter"
referenced in _Section 5.18(d)_; and (2) Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to execute and deliver to Parents Counsel and to Companys Counsel
the applicable "Tax Representation Letter" referenced in _Section 5.18(d)_.
Following the delivery of the Tax Representation Letters pursuant to the
preceding sentence, (x) the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause

 



     

 

 



 

Companys Counsel to deliver to it a tax opinion satisfying the requirements
of Item 601 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act; and (y) Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Parents Counsel to deliver
to it a tax opinion satisfying the requirements of Item 601 of Regulation S-K
under the Securities Act. In rendering such opinions, Companys Counsel and
Parents Counsel shall each be entitled to rely on the Tax Representation
Letters referred to in this _Section 5.4_ and _Section 5.18(d)_. Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to
keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall also take any
action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of process)
required to be taken under any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws
in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock in
the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of Shares and Parent and the holders of
the capital stock of Parent, as applicable, as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be
mailed to the Companys stockholders and Parents stockholders, as applicable,
as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act.

 



 

(a) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by
Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be made by the Company or Parent, in each case
without providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon (other than, in each case, any filing, amendment or supplement
in connection with a Company Change in Recommendation or a Parent Change in
Recommendation, as applicable), and each Party shall consider in good faith
all comments reasonably proposed by the other Party. Each of the Company and
Parent shall promptly provide the other with copies of all such filings,
amendments or supplements to the extent not publicly available. Each of the
Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such Person and
its Affiliates to the other and provide such other assistance as may be
reasonably requested by such other Party to be included therein and shall
otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the other in the preparation of
the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as applicable, and the
resolution of any comments to either received from the SEC. If at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent
Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company or the stockholders of Parent,
as applicable. The Parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of
any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the
SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or for additional information and shall
supply each other with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on
the other hand, with respect to the Form S-4, Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or the Merger and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the Form S-4. No
response to any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC relating to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by either Party without
providing the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon
unless pursuant to a telephone call initiated by the SEC, and each Party shall
consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by the other Party.
The Parties will cause the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
comply as to form

 



     

 

 



 

in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 



 

5.5 _Company and Parent Stockholder Meetings_.

 



 

(a) _Company Stockholders Meeting_.

 



 

(i) The Company will, as promptly as practicable in accordance with applicable
Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, establish a record date for,
duly call and give notice of, and use its reasonable best efforts to convene,
a meeting of holders of Shares to consider and vote upon the adoption of this
Agreement and the Requisite Parachute Vote, which meeting shall in any event
take place within forty-five (45) days after the declaration of the
effectiveness of the Form S-4 (the " **Company Stockholders Meeting** "). The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting on the same day as the Parent Stockholders Meeting as soon as
practicable after the date on which the Registration Statement becomes
effective. Subject to the provisions of _Section 5.2_, the Company Board
shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and recommend at the Company Stockholders Meeting that
the holders of Shares adopt this Agreement and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain and solicit such adoption. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(x) if on or before the date on which the Company Stockholders Meeting is
scheduled, the Company reasonably believes that (A) it will not receive
proxies representing the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum
is present or (B) it will not have enough Shares represented to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
the Company may (and, if requested by Parent, the Company shall) postpone or
adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of, the
Company Stockholders Meeting and (y) the Company may postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholders Meeting to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company
has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is reasonably
likely to be required under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of the
Company prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, as long as the date of the
Company Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned more than an
aggregate of fifteen (15) calendar days in connection with any such
postponements or adjournments pursuant to either or both of the preceding
clauses (x) and (y).

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding any Company Change in Recommendation, the Company shall
submit this Agreement to the holders of Shares for adoption at the Company
Stockholders Meeting unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Article VII_ prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. Without the prior
written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only
matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by Law to be
voted on by the Companys stockholders in connection with the adoption of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) that the Company shall
propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

 



 

(b) _Parent Stockholders Meeting_.

 



 

(i) Parent will, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent Charter and
Parent Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call and give notice of, and
use its reasonable best efforts to convene and hold a meeting of holders of
capital stock of Parent to consider and vote upon the Parent Share Issuance as
promptly as practicable, which meeting shall in any event take place within
forty-five (45) days after the declaration of the effectiveness of the Form
S-4.

 



     

 

 



 

Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the Parent Stockholders
Meeting on the same day as the Company Stockholders Meeting and as soon as
practicable after the date on which the Registration Statement becomes
effective. Subject to the provisions of _Section 5.3_, the Parent Board shall
include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and recommend at the Parent Stockholders Meeting that the
holders of capital stock of Parent approve the Parent Share Issuance and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and solicit such approval.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) if on or before the date on which the
Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, Parent reasonably believes that (A)
it will not receive proxies representing the Parent Stockholder Approval,
whether or not a quorum is present, or (B) it will not have enough shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock represented to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, Parent may (and, if
requested by the Company, Parent shall) postpone or adjourn, or make one or
more successive postponements or adjournments of, the Parent Stockholders
Meeting and (y) Parent may postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting
to (A) allow reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure that Parent has determined, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be required
under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of Parent prior to the Parent
Stockholders Meeting or (B) ensure that the shares of Parent Class B Common
Stock represented by the Parent Proxies (as defined in _Section 5.5(b)(ii)_
below) are voted at such Parent Stockholders Meeting in the manner set forth
in the Parent Proxies, as long as the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting
is not postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of fifteen (15) calendar
days in connection with any such postponements or adjournments pursuant to
either or both of the preceding clauses (x) and (y).

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Parent shall
(i) cause the independent directors and executive officers of Parent appointed
as attorney and proxy in each proxy delivered concurrently with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement (the " **Parent Proxies** ") to vote the shares
of Parent Class B Common Stock at the Parent Stockholders Meeting to approve
the Parent Share Issuance and to otherwise vote the shares of such Parent
Class B Common Stock in accordance with the Parent Proxies at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, (ii) take all other actions necessary or advisable to
effectuate the intent of the Parent Proxies, including designating any
additional officers or directors of Parent to act as substitute attorneys and
proxies under the Parent Proxies in the event that any of the directors or
officers listed therein are unwilling or unable to vote the shares of Parent
Class B Common Stock in accordance with the Parent Proxies at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting and (iii) shall take all actions necessary or advisable
to prevent such Parent Proxies from being revoked (to the maximum extent
permitted under applicable Laws).

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding any Parent Change in Recommendation, Parent shall seek
the Parent Stockholder Approval at the Parent Stockholders Meeting unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ prior to the Parent
Stockholders Meeting. Without the prior written consent of the Company, the
Parent Share Issuance shall be the only matter (other than matters of
procedure and matters required by Law to be voted on by Parents stockholders
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby) that Parent shall
propose to be acted on by the stockholders of Parent at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting.

 



 

5.6 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

 



 

(a) The Company and Parent shall, subject to _Sections 5.2_ and _5.3_ ,
cooperate with each other and use, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use, their respective reasonable best efforts (other than
clause (iv) below) to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause
to be done

 



     

 

 



 

all things, necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable
Laws and Orders to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible,
including (i) preparing and filing all documentation to effect all necessary
notices, reports and other filings (and in any event, by filing within ten
(10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement the notifications, filings
and other information required to be filed under the HSR Act and to obtain as
expeditiously as possible all Consents, expirations of waiting periods and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity pursuant to the HSR Act in order to consummate
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(such Consents, the " **Principal Antitrust Consent** "), (ii) satisfying the
conditions to consummating the Merger, (iii) subject to _Section 5.17_,
defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger,
(iv) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (and cooperating with
each other in obtaining) any consent, approval of, waiver or any exemption by,
any non-governmental third party, in each case, to the extent necessary,
proper or advisable in connection with the Merger (provided that for the
purposes of this Agreement, any failure to obtain such approval shall not be a
breach of this Agreement) and (v) executing and delivering any reasonable
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent shall pay the HSR filing fee owed by Parent. Each
of Parent and Company shall coordinate and cooperate with one another and
shall use all reasonable best efforts, in each case to (1) identify which of
its respective stockholders are likely to hold shares or acquire valued in
excess of the $84,400,000 (as adjusted) threshold established pursuant to
Section 7A(a)(2)(B) of the Clayton Act, 15. U.S.C. § 18a, as amended by the
HSR Act (each such stockholder, a " **Potential Backside Filer** "), (2)
notify in writing each Potential Backside Filer of its potential requirements
under the HSR Act to file with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "
**FTC** ") and the U.S. Department of Justice (the " **DOJ** ") a Notification
and Report Form relating to its acquisition of shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an "
**Investor Antitrust Filing** ") as soon as reasonably practicable following
the execution of this Agreement, and in no event later than thirty (30)
Business Days thereafter, (3) notify each Potential Backside Filer as soon as
reasonably practicable upon learning from the FTC or DOJ that a Principal
Antitrust Consent is forthcoming, and in no event later than one (1) Business
Day after receipt of such Principal Antitrust Consent (the " **Second Investor
Antitrust Notice** "), and (4) if required under the HSR Act, file with the
FTC and the DOJ Notification and Report Forms related to the Investor
Antitrust Filings, no later than the same date as the respective Investor
Antitrust Filing.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.6(c)_, in the event that the Parties receive a
request for information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Laws, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, the Parties
will use their reasonable best efforts to submit an appropriate response to
such request as promptly as practicable, and counsel for both Parties will
closely cooperate during the entirety of any such review process. Neither
Party shall agree to extend any waiting period or pull and refile under the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Entity to delay the transactions contemplated hereby except with
prior written consent of the other Party. None of the Parties shall knowingly
take, cause or permit to be taken or omit to take any action which such Party
reasonably expects is likely to materially delay or prevent consummation of
the contemplated transactions, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties.

 



 

(c) Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
respect to any filings made under the Antitrust Laws. No Party or its counsel
shall independently participate in any substantive call or meeting relating to
the Antitrust Laws with any Governmental Entity in respect of such filings,
investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other Party or its counsel
prior notice of such call or meeting and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. In
furtherance of the foregoing and to the extent permitted

 



     

 

 



 

by applicable Law, (i) each Party shall notify the other, of any filing or
material or substantive communication or inquiry it or any of its Subsidiaries
intends to make with any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are
the subject of this _Section 5.6_, (ii) prior to submitting any such filing
or making any such communication or inquiry, such Party shall provide the
other Party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review, and shall
consider in good faith the comments of the other Party in connection with, any

any Subsidiaries to make, any commitment, or committing to (or causing any
Subsidiaries to commit to) make any commitment (to any Governmental Entity or

(e) Subject to the covenants of the Parties contained in this _Section 5.6_,
if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any
proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding

injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Merger.

 



 

(f) _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, promptly furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its

5.7 _Access; Consultation_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required by
applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, afford the other Partys Representatives reasonable
access (at the requesting Partys cost) under the supervision of appropriate
personnel of the other Party, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to the other Partys, and each of its
Subsidiaries employees, properties, assets, books, records and contracts and,
during such period, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other all information
concerning its or any of its Subsidiaries capital stock, business and
personnel as may reasonably be requested by the other; _provided_ that no
investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company or Parent; and
_provided_ , _further_ that the foregoing shall require neither the Company
nor Parent to permit any invasive sampling or testing or to disclose any
information pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ to the extent that (i) in the
reasonable good faith judgment of such Party, any applicable Law requires such
Party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such
properties or information, (ii) in the reasonable good faith judgment of such
Party, the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a third
party or (iii) disclosure of any such information or document would result in
the loss of attorney-client privilege; _provided, further_ that with respect
to clauses (i) through (iii) of this _Section 5.7(a)_, Parent or the Company,
as applicable, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (1) obtain the
required consent of any such third party to provide such inspection or
disclosure, (2) develop an alternative to providing such information so as to
address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company
and (3) in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), implement appropriate and
mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a
manner to remove the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of
appropriate clean room procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint
defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the
Parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such
information without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege.
Any investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of
the other Party or create material risk of damage or destruction to any
material assets or property. Any investigation shall be subject to the
reasonable security measures and insurance requirements of the Party allowing
such investigation. All requests for information made pursuant to this
_Section 5.7_ shall be directed in writing to an executive officer of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, or such Person as may be designated by any
such executive officer.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company, as it deems advisable and necessary, may
reasonably designate competitively sensitive material provided to the other as
"Outside Counsel Only Material" or with similar restrictions. Such material
and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside
counsel of the recipient, or otherwise as the restriction indicates, and be
subject to any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement between
the Parties. All information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall
be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

To the extent that any of the information or material furnished pursuant to
this _Section 5.7_ or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the Parties
understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to
such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that
the sharing of such material is not intended to, and, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, shall not waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality
of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such
information that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, remain entitled to such protection under
these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate in
identifying any actions or practices of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that could require remediation under applicable Law and, to the extent
identified, shall cooperate in taking commercially reasonable actions or
practices and other customary actions to reduce the risks related to such
actions where the failure to remediate would reasonably be likely to result in
substantial fines or penalties.

 



 

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to one another
upon obtaining Knowledge of any Effect that would reasonably be likely to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect
(as applicable), or of any reasonably likely failure of any condition to
Parents or the Companys obligations to effect the Merger (as applicable);
provided that no failure to provide such notice shall constitute a breach of
this Agreement for the purposes of _Section 6.2(b)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ (as
applicable).

 



 

5.8 _Stock Exchange Listing, De-listing and De-registration_. Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall
take all actions necessary to permit the Shares and any other security issued
by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and listed on the NYSE to be de-
listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as
possible following the Effective Time.

 



 

5.9 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with each other prior to
issuing or making, and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on, any press releases or other public announcements with respect
to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
any filings with any Governmental Entity (including any national securities
exchange) with respect thereto, except (a) as may be required by applicable
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
national securities exchange, (b) any consultation that would not be
reasonably practicable as a result of requirements of applicable Law, (c) any
press release or public statement that in the good faith judgment of the
applicable Party is consistent with prior press releases issued or public
statements made in compliance with this _Section 5.9_, (d) any internal
announcements to employees regarding the Merger so long as such statements are
consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved by the
other Party) or (e) with respect to any Company Change in Recommendation or
Parent Change in Recommendation made in accordance with this Agreement, or the
other Partys response thereto, statements made pursuant to _Section 5.2(h)
_in the case of the Company or _Section 5.3(h)_ in the case of Parent, or in
connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition
Proposal received by the Company or Parent, as applicable.

 



       
 

 



 

5.10 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that each employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
who continues to remain employed with the Company or a Company Subsidiary
following the Effective Time (each, a " **Continuing Employee** ") shall,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " **Continuation Period** "), be provided
with (i) an annual rate of base salary or base wage that is no less favorable
than the annual rate of base salary or base wage provided to such Continuing
Employee by the Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) other benefits (excluding any equity-based
compensation, cash incentive arrangements and any pension, post-retirement or
deferred compensation benefits) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company or a
Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent further
agrees, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to honor and abide by the
terms of any written severance and change in control plans, agreements and
arrangements for the benefit of the Continuing Employees that are in effect as
of the date of this Agreement, as scheduled in _Section 5.10(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to waive, or cause its insurance carriers to waive, all
pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods that could otherwise
apply to any Continuing Employee under the benefit plans provided for such
Continuing Employee following the Closing, to the extent permitted by such
plans and to the extent such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods were
applicable to the Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time. With
respect to the plan year during which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Company to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide each Continuing Employee with credit for deductibles and out-of-
pocket requirements paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any benefit plans
provided for such Continuing Employee following the Closing, to the extent
permitted by such plans.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, provide credit to Continuing Employees for their service
recognized by the Company or a Company Subsidiary as of the Effective Time for
purposes of eligibility, vesting (excluding for any equity-based
compensation), vacation, paid time off, and severance entitlements to the same
extent and for the same purposes as such service was credited under the
Company Plans, _provided_ that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.

 



 

(d) If Parent so requests (which request shall be made not less than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time), the Company shall take any and all
actions required (including, without limitation, the adoption of resolutions
by the Company Board of Directors, which shall be subject to approval by
Parent) to amend, suspend or terminate the Companys 401(k) plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time to the extent such actions are permitted by Law
(including any required prior notice obligations), the terms of this _Section
5.10_ and the terms of such plan; _provided_ that any amendment, suspension or
termination of the Companys 401(k) plan shall not impact the benefits
required to be provided pursuant to _Section 5.10(a)_. Parent shall (1) allow
eligible rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of their account
balances (in cash) and (2) use reasonable best efforts to accommodate eligible
rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of their account balances in
loan notes evidencing loans to Continuing Employees as of the date of
distribution, in each case from the Company 401(k) Plan as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement, and no other Person, including any current or
former employee, participant in any Company Plan or other dependent,
beneficiary or other individual associated therewith, is or shall be regarded
for any purpose as a third party beneficiary to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (except to the
extent provided in _Section 8.8_), no provision of this Agreement is intended
to, or does, (i) constitute the establishment of, or an amendment to, any
Company Plan or any employee

 



     

 

 



 

benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates, (ii)
alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to amend, modify
or terminate any Company Plan, any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, (iii) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of
this _Section 5.10_, (iv) prevent Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the employment of
any Continuing Employee or (v) be deemed to confer upon any such individual or
legal representative any right to continued employment or any rights under or
with respect to any plan, program or arrangement described in or contemplated
by this Agreement, and each such individual or legal representative shall be
entitled to look only to the express terms of any such plan, program or
arrangement for his or her rights thereunder.

 



 

5.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Sections 7.5_ and _7.6_ ,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring such
expense.

 



 

5.12 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. From and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify and
hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company
determined as of the Effective Time (the " **Indemnified Parties** "), against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a " **Proceeding** ")
(including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby)), arising out of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the
transactions and actions contemplated hereby)) in connection with such
Indemnified Party serving as a director or officer of the Company, or, while a
director or officer of the Company, is or was serving at the specific request
of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Person, in
each case, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been required to under
Delaware Law, any applicable written indemnification agreement to which such
Person is a party in effect as of the date of this Agreement (a " **Company
Indemnification Agreement** ") (any such Company Indemnification Agreement
having been provided to Parent), or the Company Charter or Company Bylaws in
effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person. The Surviving
Company shall also advance reasonable and documented legal expenses as
incurred by Indemnified Parties in defending any proceeding to the same extent
as such Indemnified Parties are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the
date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company Charter, Company
Bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement or any Company Indemnification
Agreement to which such Person is a party; _provided_ that the Person to whom
expenses are advanced shall provide a written undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification). Parent shall ensure that the organizational documents of the
Surviving Company shall, for a period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently
set forth in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws. Any right of
indemnification of an Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 5.12_ shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified at any time in a manner for a
period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time that would adversely
affect the rights of such Indemnified Party as provided herein.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company as of the Effective Time
to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claim reporting
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the
Companys current insurance carrier or carriers (or carriers with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier or carriers)
with respect to directors and

 



     

 

 



 

officers liability insurance, employment practices liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance with terms and conditions and limits of
liability at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with
respect to claims made after the Effective Time arising from acts, errors or
omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); _provided_ , _however_ that in no event shall the Company expend for
such policies a one-time premium amount in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance
_provided_ , _further_ that if the premium for such insurance coverage exceeds
such amount, the Surviving Company shall obtain policies with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(b) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with
or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such case proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall
assume all of the obligations of Parent set forth in this _Section 5.12_.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.12_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs
and their representatives. The rights of each Indemnified Party under this
_Section 5.12_ shall be in addition to any rights such individual may have
under Delaware Law, any Company Indemnification Agreement to which such Person
is a party, the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.12_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

5.13 _Takeover Statute_. The Company and the Company Board and Parent and the
Parent Board shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to (x) take
all action reasonably appropriate to ensure that no state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, take all action reasonably appropriate to
ensure that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

5.14 _Control of the Company s or Parents Operations_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company, directly or indirectly,
rights to control or direct the operations of the other prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision of its operations.

 



 

5.15 _Section 16(b)_. The board of directors of each of the Company and
Parent (or, in each case, a duly authorized committee thereof) shall, prior to
the Effective Time, take all such actions within its control as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company and
acquisitions of equity securities of Parent (including derivative securities)
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company or is or may
become

 



     

 

 



 

a director or executive officer of Parent in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 



 

5.16 _Approval by Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub_. Immediately following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parties, Parent, as sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, shall adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger,
in accordance with Delaware Law, by written consent.

 



 

5.17 _Stockholder Litigation_. Each Party shall notify the other Party, in
writing and promptly after acquiring knowledge thereof, of any litigation
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby that is brought against or, to the Knowledge of such Party, threatened
against, such Party, its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors
or officers and shall keep the other Party informed on a reasonably current
basis with respect to the status thereof. The Parties agree to cooperate in
the defense and settlement of any such litigation, and neither Party shall
settle any such litigation without the prior written consent of the other
Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without
limiting in any way the Parties obligations under _Section 5.6_, each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
cooperate in the defense or settlement of any litigation contemplated by this
_Section 5.17_.

 



 

5.18 _Tax Treatment_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its respective reasonable best
efforts to, and cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, (i) cause the
Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code and (ii) obtain the opinion of counsel referred to in _Section
6.2(d)_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall take any action (or fail to take
any action, including failing to use its reasonable best efforts to proscribe
any of its respective Subsidiaries from taking any action) that could
reasonably be expected to prevent or impede such qualification.

 



 

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and cause the
Company Subsidiaries to, (i) cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (ii) obtain the opinion
of counsel referred to in _Section 6.3(d)_. The Company shall not take any
action (or fail to take any action, including failing to use its reasonable
best efforts to proscribe any of its Subsidiaries from taking any action) that
could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede such qualification.

 



 

(c) Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Code, (i) each of the Parties shall report the
Merger for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code in all Tax Returns, and (ii) none of the
Parties shall take any Tax reporting position inconsistent with the
characterization of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties to this
Agreement adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

 



 

(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall deliver to Cooley LLP (" **Company s

Counsel, in each case if applicable) letters signed by an officer thereof and

this Agreement and at and as of the Closing Date as if made at and as of such
time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case
as of such earlier date), except where the failure of such representations and

this Agreement and at and as of the Closing Date as if made at and as of such
time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case

been if such representations and warranties had been true and correct in all
respects.

 



 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall have performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the
Closing.

rendering such opinion, Companys Counsel (or Companys Replacement Counsel,
if applicable) shall be entitled to rely upon the representations contained in
the Tax Representation Letters of Parent and the Company referred to in
_Section 5.18(d)_ hereto and upon such other representations as the counsel
rendering such tax opinion reasonably deems relevant.

 



 

(e) _Parent Certificate_. The Company shall have received at the Closing a
certificate signed on behalf of Parent by a senior executive officer of Parent
to the effect that the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.3(a)_ , _(b)_ ,

rely, either as a basis for not consummating the Merger or the other
transactions or terminating this Agreement and abandoning the Merger, on the
failure of any condition set forth in _Sections 6.1_ , _6.2_ or _6.3_ , as the
case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such Partys
material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,

Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub and any of their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, shareholders, managers,
members, Representatives or Affiliates for any loss suffered as a result of

Willful Breach), and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, shareholders, managers, members, Representatives or Affiliates shall

Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for the

and the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or
future general or limited partners, shareholders, managers, members,
Representatives or Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
