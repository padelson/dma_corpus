US$100,000, then the transaction provided for in the first sentence of this
_Section 2.2.24_ shall be effected immediately before the Merger and

  



  

10   

     
   

  



  

the Parties shall take such additional actions as may be reasonably requested
by any Party to effect this change.

US$1,600,000 pursuant to the terms of the associated cash bonus plan.

  



  

 **2.3** ** ****_Aggregate Unit Number Adjustment_**

  



  

In the event the Offering is completed at an actual price per Unit (the "
**Actual Offering Price** ") which is less than Cdn$25.63 per Unit (the "
**Signing Unit Price** "), the Aggregate Unit Number shall be decreased as
shown in _Exhibit 2.3_ (for greater certainty, the Aggregate Unit Number
shall never be greater than 23,307,185); provided that if the Fund has
completed the acquisition of another business at any time after the date
hereof and before the completion of the Offering, the amounts set forth in
_Exhibit 2.3_ shall be adjusted upwards (but in no event shall the Aggregate
Unit Number be greater than 23,307,185) in order that the simple annualized
accretion in the Funds free cash flow available for distribution per Unit
outstanding on the date hereof reflects the pro forma effect of such
acquisition(s) on a basis and in a manner consistent with the methodologies
used to prepare _Exhibit 2.3_.

  



  

 **2.4** ** ****_Officers and Directors of Su_** ** _rviving Corporation_**

or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an officer or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The directors
of the Surviving Corporation shall be the individuals set forth on _Exhibit
2.4_ until the earlier of their resignation or removal or their otherwise
ceasing to be a director or until their respective successors are duly

 **2.5** ** ****_Appraisal Remedy_**

  



  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of IESI
Common Stock and IESI Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time held by a holder (if any) who has the right to
demand payment for and properly demands an appraisal of such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (or any

  



  

11   

     
   

  



  

successor provision) (" **Dissenting Shares** ") shall not be converted into
a right to receive Participating Preferred Shares but shall only have the
rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL (or any successor provision)
unless such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise
loses such holders right to such payment or appraisal, if any, with respect
to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal, each such share of such
holder shall not be treated as a Dissenting Share for purposes of this
Agreement and shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive Participating Preferred Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.2.17_, without interest. IESI shall give prompt
notice to the Fund of any demands received by IESI for appraisal of shares of
IESI Common Stock or IESI Preferred Stock, withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by IESI, and the
Fund shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. IESI shall not, except with the
prior written consent of the Fund, (i) make any payment with respect to any
such demand, (ii) settle or offer to settle any such demand, (iii) waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any
other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL or (iv)
agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

 **2.6** ** ****_Closing_**

  



  

2.6.1. _The Closing_.  The Closing shall take place on the Closing Date at
9:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of Torys LLP, 237 Park Avenue, New
York, New York 10017.

  



  

2.6.2. _Exchange Procedure for Stock_.  Within a reasonable period prior to
the Closing Date, IESI shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates of which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of IESI Common Stock or IESI Preferred Stock (the "
**Certificates** ") whose shares were converted into the right to receive
such holders ratable portion of the Participating Preferred Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.2.17_: (i) a letter of transmittal provided by
the Fund and reasonably satisfactory to IESI (the " **Letter
of Transmittal** ") and (ii) instructions as specified by the Fund for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
such Participating Preferred Shares. After the Effective Time, upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Surviving Corporation or
to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Surviving
Corporation, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and
executed, and such other instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Surviving Corporation
shall promptly distribute to such holder, the number of Participating
Preferred Shares that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section
2.2.17_ and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of IESI Common Stock or IESI
Preferred Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Surviving Corporation, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.6.2_ , each Certificate shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender a ratable portion of the Participating Preferred Shares into
which the shares of IESI Common Stock or IESI Preferred Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to
_Section 2.2.17_ , together with all accrued distributions thereon.

  



  

2.6.3. _No Further Ownership Rights_.  The Participating Preferred Shares
delivered upon the surrender of the shares of IESI Common Stock or IESI
Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been delivered in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares.
There shall be no further registration or transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of IESI Common Stock or IESI
Preferred Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

  



  

2.6.4. _No Liability_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 2.6_, none of the Purchasers nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of shares of IESI Common Stock or IESI Preferred Stock
for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law, rule, regulation, statute, order,
judgment or decree.

  



  

2.6.5. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
representing shares of IESI Common Stock or IESI Preferred Stock shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation shall deliver the
Participating Preferred Shares in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver an indemnity
(with or without a bond in support thereof and in such sum as it may
reasonably direct) against any claim that may be made against the Surviving
Corporation with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

  



  

2.6.6. _No Fractional Shares_.  No certificates representing fractional
shares of Participating Preferred Stock shall be issued. In lieu of such
issuance of fractional shares, the Surviving Corporation shall pay
each holder of certificates representing shares of IESI Common Stock or
IESI Preferred Stock which would otherwise entitle such holder to receive
fractional shares of Participating Preferred Stock an amount in cash equal to
the product of (i) the portion of a single share of Participating Preferred
Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive were fractional shares of
Participating Preferred Stock permitted to be issued hereunder and (ii) the
value of a single share of Participating Preferred Stock, based on the
product of the Exchange Ratio as of Closing and the Closing Unit Value.

2.6.7. _Exchange Procedure for Options; Warrants._

surrender of the Sowell Warrant and Boisture Warrant, deliver to the holders

forth in the Allocation Certificate.

By their approval of the Merger, each of the Owners shall conclusively be
deemed to have consented to, approved and agreed to be personally bound by,
as applicable: (i) the appointment of TC Equity Partners IV, L.L.C. as the
initial Owner Representative and as the attorney-in-fact and agent for and on
behalf of each of the Owners as provided in this Agreement; (ii) the taking
by the Owner Representative of any and all actions and the making of any
decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Owner Representative under
this Agreement; (iii) the obligation of each Owner to reimburse the Owner
Representative as set forth in the last sentence of this _Section 2.7_ in
the event that the Owner Representative incurs any expenses in
connection with fulfilling its responsibilities under _Article VI_,
which expenses are not otherwise reimbursable by the Fund in accordance with
_Article VI_; and (iv) the obligation to indemnify and hold the Owner
Representative harmless from any Losses incurred by such Person in conduct of
its duties under _Article VI_, except to the extent of any such Losses
arising from fraud or wilful misconduct by the Owner Representative. The
Owner Representative shall have authority and power to act on behalf of each
Owner with respect to the disposition, settlement or other handling of all
indemnity claims under _Article VI_ so long as all the Owners are treated in
a consistent manner in accordance with their interests and/or consent in
writing to different treatment. Each Owner shall be bound by all actions
taken by the Owner Representative in connection with indemnity claims under
_Article VI_, and the Purchasers shall be entitled to rely on any action or
decision of the Owner Representative in connection therewith. The
Owner Representative may be changed from time to time upon the approval of
holders of a majority of the Escrow Shares. In the event that the Owner
Representative incurs expenses or suffers Losses which are reimbursable or
indemnifiable (as the case may be) by the Owners as described in clauses
(iii) and (iv) above, upon written notice by the Owner Representative to the
Fund, the Fund shall amend Schedule I of the Securityholders Agreement to
reallocate the percentage interests of the Owners in the Escrow Shares pro
rata as directed by the Owner Representative so that, immediately after such
reallocation, in the event of a full release of the Escrow Shares to the
Owners, the Owners designated by the Owner Representative to receive the
benefit of such reallocation (which are anticipated to be the Owner
Representative and/or one or more affiliates thereof) would be entitled to
receive an additional number of Escrow Shares having a value (based on
the Market Price Per Unit as of the relevant date of such notice and the
applicable Exchange Ratio) equal to the applicable amount of reimbursable
expenses or indemnifiable Losses, as applicable.

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

 **2.8** ** ****_Escrow Share_** ** _s_** **.**

aggregate number of (i) Class A Escrow Shares, (ii) Class B Escrow Shares,
(iii) Series A Preferred Escrow Shares, (iv) Series B Preferred
Escrow Shares, (v) Series C Preferred Escrow Shares, (vi) Series D
Preferred Escrow Shares, and (vii) Series E Preferred Escrow Shares
(collectively, the " **Escrow Shares** ") shall be certificated, delivered
and held by the Surviving Corporation on behalf of the Owners until such
shares are released to the Owners or transferred and cancelled pursuant
to and in accordance with _Article VI_.  The number of Escrow Shares set
aside and held by the Surviving Corporation shall be adjusted from time to
time upon the occurrence of certain events specified in _Article VI_.

particular representation and warranty of IESI contained in this Agreement
except for such disclosures, if any, as shall be set forth in the _IESI
Disclosure Letter_  under a Section heading that corresponds to the Section

Matters reflected in the _IESI Disclosure Letter_ are not necessarily limited

Letter_. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes
only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.

  



  

As of the date hereof, IESI represents and warrants to the Purchasers as to
the following:

  



  

 **3.1** ** _Authorization_**

  



  

IESI has the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a
party and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, including the
completion of the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance by
IESI of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is or will
be a party, including the completion of the Transactions, have been duly
authorized by all necessary (corporate) action on the part of IESI and its
directors and stockholders, and no other action on the part of IESI or its
directors and stockholders, is necessary to authorize such execution,
delivery or performance.

  



  

 **3.2** ** _Existence and Good Sta_ _nding; Authority; Binding Obligation_**

  



  

3.2.1. Each IESI Entity is an organization duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation
or organization. Each IESI Entity has the full legal right, power and
authority to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents to which it is or
will be a party and to perform its obligations

  



  

15   

     
   

  



  

thereunder, including the completion of the relevant Transactions. Assuming
in each case valid execution and delivery by the other parties thereto, this
Agreement constitutes and, when executed and delivered by the relevant IESI
Entities, as applicable, each of the other Transaction Documents will
constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of each IESI Entity that is
a party thereto enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the same
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws in effect from time to time relating to or

a proceeding in equity or at law) (the " **Enforcement Qualifications** ").

  



  

3.2.2. Each IESI Entity has the full power and authority to own, lease and
operate its assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each
IESI Entity is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction where the
character or location of the properties owned or leased by it, or the nature
of the business conducted by it, requires such qualification, except where
the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
the IESI Entities or the IESI Business. Each IESI Entity has provided or
made available to the Fund correct and complete copies of all its
organizational and governing documents, including all amendments thereto and
restatements thereof. None of the IESI Entities is in default of any of the
terms or conditions of any of its organizational and governing documents.
After giving effect to any waivers of the IESI stockholders included in the
stockholder consents authorizing the Transactions, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents by the IESI
Entities, as applicable, nor the performance of their respective obligations
thereunder, including the completion of the Transactions, conflict with or
will conflict with or violate or will violate any provision of their
respective organizational or governing documents.

may otherwise be noted therein. The IESI Financial Statements present
fairly, in all materials respects, the consolidated financial position of
IESI and its consolidated subsidiaries as of their respective dates,
and their results of operations for the year and period, respectively, then
ended.

  



  

 **3.7** **_Liabilities_**

  



  

3.7.1. None of the IESI Entities has any Liabilities, whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise, that United States GAAP would require to
be reflected in the balance sheet included in the IESI Interim Financial
Statements to present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated

as and to the extent reserved for in the balance sheet contained in the IESI
Interim Financial Statements or in the notes thereto, (ii) current
liabilities in respect of trade or business obligations incurred after the
IESI Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course (and not materially different
in type or amount), none of which, separately or in the aggregate, has had a
Material Adverse Effect on the IESI Entities or the IESI Business, (iii) as
set forth in _Section 3.7.1_ of the _IESI Disclosure Letter_ and (iv) any

Arrangements have been delivered or made available to the Fund and on the
Closing Date, _Section 3.7.2(b)_ of the _IESI Disclosure Letter_ will set
forth a list of all surety bonds, letters of credit and similar instruments
binding on any IESI Entity as of December 31, 2004.

  



  

3.7.3. The accounts payable reflected on the balance sheet included in the
IESI Interim Financial Statements and such additional amounts payable as will
be reflected on the Books and Records of the IESI Entities on the Closing
Date have arisen or will arise from bona fide, arms length transactions in
the Ordinary Course. During the twelve month period prior to the date
hereof, none of the IESI Entities has failed to pay any of its

  



  

18   

     
   

  



  

accounts payable in excess of $100,000 in the Ordinary Course other than
matters currently in dispute and set forth in _Section 3.7.3_ of the _IESI
Disclosure Letter_.

  



  

 **3.8** **_Accounts Receivable_**

  



  

All of the Accounts Receivable and all such accounts receivable which have
arisen since the IESI Balance Sheet Date are or have arisen only from
bona fide, arms length transactions in the Ordinary Course and, to
IESIs Knowledge, constitute valid and enforceable claims. Except as set
forth in _Section 3.8_ of the _IESI Disclosure Letter,_ and other than as
has been reserved for in the IESI Interim Financial Statements, to IESIs
Knowledge there are no known or asserted claims, or rights of set off against
any such accounts receivable and no account debtor or note debtor has refused
to pay, in a timely manner or otherwise, or threatened to refuse in writing
or, to IESIs Knowledge, orally to pay its accounts receivable obligations to
the IESI Entities for any reason, or has otherwise made a claim of set-off or

reflected therein. The minute books of each IESI Entity contain materially
complete and materially accurate records of all organizational and governing
documents including all meetings of, and actions or written consents taken
by, the directors, stockholders, partners, managers and members of the IESI
Entities, as the case may be. True and complete copies of such minute
books and Books and Records have been made and continue to be made available
for inspection by the Purchasers and their Representatives.

  



  

 **3.10** **_Properties; Encumbrances; Condition; Leases; Licenses_**

leasehold rights shall be free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Liens
and restrictions contained in the relevant lease and any restrictions imposed
by operating permits relating to

  



  

19   

     
   

  



  

such Leased Real Property. The IESI Entities, as applicable, have the right
to use such Leased Real Property in accordance with the terms of
the applicable lease for the conduct of its business as presently conducted
in all material respects. None of the IESI Entities have received any
written or, to IESIs Knowledge, oral notice that any Material Lease will not
be renewed at the termination thereof or that any such lease will be renewed
only at substantially higher rent. To IESIs Knowledge, the IESI Entities,
as applicable, are in peaceable possession of the Leased Real Property.

  



  

3.10.1.4. None of the IESI Entities has received any written or, to IESIs
Knowledge, oral notice from any Governmental Authority claiming that such

Permits, nor the Laws pursuant to which they were issued require that any
consent or approval of, of filing with or notice to, any Governmental
Authority or other Person be made to assure the continued holding by any IESI
Entity of the IESI Permits after the Closing except for the IESI Consents.

5.5.2. shall promptly inform the Purchasers if any IESI Entity or any of
their Representatives receives, after the date hereof, any offer, proposal or
inquiry in respect of any such transaction and provide the Fund with a copy

 **5.6** ** _No Shop Covenan_ _t - Purchasers_**

  



  

5.6.1. In consideration of the substantial expenditure of time, effort and
expense undertaken and to be undertaken by IESI in connection with the
Transactions, the Purchasers, until such time as the Closing shall be
completed or this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with its terms,
shall not, and shall not permit any BFI Entity or any director, manager,
trustee, officer or employee of any of them to, or authorize any
Representative or any other Person retained by any of them to, directly or
indirectly, without the written consent of IESI:

  



  

(i) except as otherwise permitted by paragraph (ii) below or by _Section
5.2.1_, solicit, initiate, encourage, negotiate, discuss or otherwise take
any action with respect to any proposal to or of any Person or furnish
information with respect to any BFI Entity or the BFI Business to, or
otherwise have any communication with, any Person (other than IESI and its
Representatives) in connection with any (A) merger, plan of arrangement,
consolidation, amalgamation, share or unit exchange, business combination,
acquisition recapitalization, tender offer, exchange offer or other similar
transaction involving any BFI Entity; (B) sale, lease, exchange, transfer,
license, or disposition of all or a substantial portion of the ownership

approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (E) subject to
_Section 5.7.2_, enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any
Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal;
provided, however, that prior to the approval of the Transactions at the
Unitholders Meeting, this paragraph (ii) shall not prohibit the Fund from
entering into a confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on
the use and disclosure of all non-public written and oral information
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Fund, containing customary
"standstill" provisions and being no more favourable to the receiving party
than the Confidentiality Agreement (a " **Standard Confidentiality Agreement**
"), furnishing information regarding the BFI Entities to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations

  



  

59   

     
   

  



  

with, any Person in response to an unsolicited written bona fide Acquisition
Proposal that is submitted to the Fund by such Person (and not withdrawn) and
that the Trustees determine in good faith is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal if (1) neither the Purchasers nor any of their
Representatives shall have breached or taken any action inconsistent with any
of the provisions set forth in this _Section 5.6.1_ in a manner that
directly or indirectly has led or contributed to the submission of such
Acquisition Proposal, (2) the Trustees conclude in good faith, after
considering the written advice of their outside legal counsel, that such
action is required in order for the Trustees to comply with their fiduciary
obligations to the Unitholders under applicable law, (3) at least
two Business Days prior to furnishing any such non-public information to,
or entering into discussions with, such Person, the Fund gives IESI written
notice of the identity of such Person and of the Funds intention to
furnish non-public information to, or enter into discussions with, such
Person, and the Fund receives from such Person an executed Standard
Confidentiality Agreement, and (4) at the same time as it furnishes any such
information to such Person, the Fund furnishes such non-public information to
IESI.

  



  

5.6.2. The Fund shall promptly inform IESI if any BFI Entity, any of their
Representatives or any other Person receives, after the date hereof, any
proposal or inquiry in respect of any such transaction described in _Section
5.6.1_. In addition, the Fund shall promptly (and in no event later than 24
hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public
information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal) advise IESI in
writing of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information
relating to any of the BFI Entities in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal (including the identity of the Person making or submitting such
Acquisition Proposal and the terms thereof) that is made or submitted by any
Person prior to Closing and provide IESI with a copy of such Acquisition
Proposal or request for non-public information. The Fund shall keep IESI fully
informed in a timely manner with respect to the status of any such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request and any
modification or proposed modification thereto.

  



  

 **5.7** ** _Right to Match_**

  



  

5.7.1. The Fund shall not accept, approve, recommend or enter into any
agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal (other than a Standard
Confidentiality Agreement to the extent permitted by _Section 5.6.1_) unless
(i) it has provided IESI with a copy of the Acquisition Proposal document
which the Trustees have determined would be a Superior Proposal, and (ii) ten
Business Days shall have elapsed from the later of the date IESI received
written notice of the Trustees proposed determination to accept, approve,
recommend or enter into an agreement in respect of such Acquisition Proposal,
and the date IESI receives a copy of the Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

60   

     
   

  



  

5.7.2. During such ten Business Day period, the Fund acknowledges that IESI
shall have the opportunity, but not the obligation, to propose to amend the
terms of this Agreement and the Transactions. The Trustees will review any
proposal by IESI to amend the terms of this Agreement in good faith in order
to determine, in its discretion in the exercise of its fiduciary duties,
whether IESIs proposal upon acceptance by the Fund would result in the
Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal. If the Trustees so
determine, the Fund will enter into an amended agreement with IESI reflecting
IESIs amended proposal. If the Trustees continue to believe, in good faith
and after consultation with financial advisors and outside counsel that the
Acquisition Proposal is nonetheless a Superior Proposal and therefore rejects
IESIs amended proposal, the Fund will be entitled to provide notice to IESI
that it is terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.2.5_ upon
payment by the Fund to IESI of the Break-up Fee.

  



  

5.7.3. The Fund also acknowledges and agrees that each successive
modification of any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of the requirement under _Section 5.7.2_ to initiate
an additional ten Business Day notice period.

governmental authorities in Canada or the United States) in connection with
the Offering and the approval of the Unitholder Approval Matters at the
Unitholders Meeting, including (i) IESI entering into a trust agreement in
the form prescribed by the Toronto Stock Exchange providing for certain

61

5.9.3. Each Party shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain
borrowings under the US Credit Facility as necessary to fund the Transactions
given the actual Offering size, including taking or causing to be taken, any
and all actions that may be desirable in connection therewith, provided that
such actions do not Impair the Transactions.

Fund of any Acquisition Proposal.

prepare the Proxy Materials together with any other documents required by
applicable Laws in connection with the Unitholders Meeting, and the Fund

5.11.1. As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and
subject to IESIs receipt of the Regulation D Information, in any event no
later than 20 days prior to the Effective Time, IESI shall deliver (i) to

to obtain the IESI Consents, including taking or causing to be taken, any and
all actions that may be desirable in connection therewith, provided that such

(including, as soon as practicable, giving any required notices, or making

5.14.1. Subject to _Section 5.14.2_ through _5.14.5_ , inclusive, the

referred to herein as " **Purchaser Fault Termination** "), the following
third party non-advisor fees and expenses (the " **Non-Advisor Costs** ")

certificate of incorporation and by-laws for at least six years, provisions
regarding elimination of liability of directors and indemnification of and
advancement of expenses to officers, directors, employees and other persons
which are at least as favourable to such persons as are currently contained
in the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and (ii) maintain for a
period of at least six years, the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
IESI (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous in any material
respect than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof) with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time (including in respect of the Transactions); provided, however,
that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any
one year an amount in excess of 150% of the annual premiums currently paid by
IESI for such insurance (such 150% amount, the " **Maximum Premium** ");
provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, IESI shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium.
The provisions of clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall
be deemed to have been satisfied if the Fund obtains or causes to be obtained
for the Surviving Corporation prepaid policies, which policies provide
such directors and officers with the coverage described in clause (ii) above.
If such prepaid policies have been obtained for the Surviving Corporation,
the Fund shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such policies in
full force and effect, and to continue to honour the Surviving Corporations
obligations thereunder. If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.16_. The Fund agrees to cause the
Surviving Corporation to comply with its obligations under this _Section
5.16_, including by providing any funds to the Surviving Corporation
necessary to enable the Surviving Corporation to fulfill its obligations
hereunder.

  



  

 **Article VI** 


  

 **INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**

  

 ** **

  

 **6.1** ** _Indemnification of the Purchasers_**

  



  

6.1.1. From and after the Closing Date and subject to _Section 6.1.3_ and
_Section 6.3_ and in accordance with _Section 6.1.2_, the Fund (the "
**Purchaser Indemnified Party** ") shall be indemnified against and in
respect of any and all Losses caused by or resulting or arising from (i) any
inaccuracy in, any breach of, or any failure to perform or comply with,
any of IESIs representations, warranties or agreements contained in this

  



  

66   

     
   

  



  

Agreement (limited to breaches, or failures to perform or comply, occurring
at or before the Closing) other than with respect to matters addressed in
clauses (ii) through (vi)); (ii) any third-party advisor fees and expenses
and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any IESI Entity in connection
with the negotiation and finalization of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents and the completion of the Transactions if and to the extent that
such fees and expenses are (x) materially more in the aggregate than the
estimate of third-party advisor fees and expenses provided by IESI to the
Fund prior to the date of this Agreement and (y) unreasonable; (iii) (A) any
inaccuracy or breach of _Section 3.3.1_ (but solely with respect to equity
securities of IESI), (B) any inaccuracy or breach of the first sentence of
_Section 3.4_ (but solely with respect to options and warrants to purchase,
or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, equity securities of
IESI) and (C) any claim by any holder before Closing of any equity securities
of IESI, or any options or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for, equity securities of IESI that the consideration
received by them in the Merger as set forth on the Allocation Certificate was
less than they were entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of such
securities or any plan or agreement of IESI under which such securities were
issued; (iv) any Tantalo Purchaser Amount (as defined below); (v) any Seneca
Meadows Purchaser Tax Amount (as defined below); and (vi) any Excess
Parachute Amount (as defined below) (in each case a " **Purchaser Loss**
"), in each case by (and only by) reducing the number of Escrow Shares
in accordance with _Section 6.4_.

  



  

6.1.2. The Purchaser Indemnified Party shall promptly after it becomes aware
of any circumstance which might reasonably be expected to become the subject
matter of a claim to be made by it under _Section 6.1_ (a "
**Purchaser Claim** ") including any action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim against any BFI Entity by a third party (for
purposes of this section, " **Third-Party Claim** "), advise the
Owner Representative of such circumstance, and shall provide the
Owner Representative, from time to time, such information as the Owner
Representative shall reasonably request in connection therewith; provided
that any delay or failure to so advise the Owner Representative shall not
affect the rights of the Purchaser Indemnified Party hereunder except to the
extent that the Owners are prejudiced by such delay or failure.  The Owner
Representative shall be entitled to but shall not be obligated to assume
exclusive control and discretion in the conduct of the defence of any Third-
Party Claim; provided that the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be permitted
to retain one separate counsel, at the Owners expense (satisfied exclusively
out of the Cap Amount pursuant to _Section 6.1.4)_ in respect of a Third-
Party Claim (i) for which the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have been
advised by counsel that there are one or more legal or equitable defences
available to the Purchaser Indemnified Party and, in the reasonable opinion
of the Purchaser Indemnified Party, counsel for the Owners could not
adequately represent the interests of the Purchaser Indemnified Party because
such interests could be in conflict with those of the Owners; or (ii) for
which the Owner Representative shall not have assumed the defence within 20
days of receiving notice thereof; and provided further that in the event that
the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall in good faith determine that the
conduct of the defence of the Third-Party Claim or any proposed settlement of
the Third-Party Claim by the Owner Representative may be expected to
affect adversely the conduct of the IESI Business or BFI Business in any
material respect, the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have the right, at
all times, to take over and assume control over the Third-Party Claim at

  



  

67   

     
   

  



  

the Owners expense (satisfied exclusively pursuant to _Section 6.1.4_). The
Owner Representative shall not settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or
allow a default or consent to entry of any judgment with respect thereto
without obtaining an unqualified and full release of the Purchaser
Indemnified Party in connection therewith. The Purchaser Indemnified Party
shall also have the right to employ separate counsel in any action brought in
respect of any matter which is or may be the subject of a Third-Party Claim
for indemnification hereunder, and shall have the right to participate in
the defence thereof, but the fees and expenses related thereto, including
fees and expenses of counsel, shall be at the expense of the Purchaser
Indemnified Party except as otherwise permitted by the second sentence of
this _Section 6.1.2_. The assumption of control and conduct of the defence
by the Owner Representative of any matter which might reasonably be expected
to become a Third-Party Claim shall not constitute an acknowledgement by the
Owner Representative of any Qualifying Purchaser Loss, the procedures for
determining such Qualifying Purchaser Loss being set forth in _Section 6.5_.

  



  

6.1.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the
event of a Purchaser Loss, the number of Escrow Shares shall not be reduced
in accordance with _Section 6.4_:

  



  

6.1.3.1. except with respect to any Purchaser Loss described in clauses (ii)
through (vi) of _Section 6.1.1_, until such time as the aggregate of all
indemnifiable Purchaser Losses exceeds an aggregate threshold amount of
$3,000,000 (the " **Basket Amount** "), at which time, subject to _Section
6.1.3.2_, all such amounts shall be indemnifiable hereunder, excluding the
Basket Amount;

  



  

6.1.3.2. after such time as the aggregate of all indemnifiable Purchaser
Losses exceeds an amount equal to (i) at any time prior to the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " **First Anniversary** "), the value of
the Closing Escrow Shares and (ii) at any time following the First
Anniversary but prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the
value of the Second Year Cap Shares (as applicable, the " **Cap Amount** ");

  



  

6.1.3.3. unless such claim is asserted in writing on or prior to the
Expiration Date;

  



  

6.1.3.4. unless and until such time as such Purchaser Loss is determined to
be a Qualifying Purchaser Loss in accordance with _Section 6.5_; and

  



  

6.1.3.5. in the case of a breach of _Section 3.28_ (Prospectus Disclosure)
or _Section 3.29_ (Proxy Materials) or of the agreements set forth in
_Sections 5.8.2_ and _5.10.3_ , unless and solely to the extent that such
Purchaser Loss involves Losses arising from a claim against the Fund or its
Affiliates by a Unitholder under the Prospectus or Proxy Materials, as the
case may be, or by an underwriter under the Underwriting Agreement entered
into in connection with the Offering.

  



  

68   

     
   

  



  

6.1.4. In the event that the Purchaser Indemnified Party retains separate
counsel, or takes over and assumes control over a Third-Party Claim, at the
Owners expense pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 6.1.2_ (it being
understood and agreed that such expense shall only be borne by the Owners if
it is in respect of Qualifying Purchaser Loss), upon written notice from the
Purchaser Indemnified Party to the Owner Representative of the amount of any
such reimbursable expenses, a number of Escrow Shares equal to the product of
(i) the quotient of the applicable amount of reimbursable expenses over the
Market Price Per Unit on the date of delivery of such notice and (ii) the
applicable Exchange Ratio, shall be transferred to IESI and cancelled.

  



  

 **6.2** ** _Indemnification of the Owners_**

  



  

6.2.1. From and after the Closing Date and subject to _Section 6.2.3_ and
_Section 6.3_ and in accordance with _Section 6.2.2_, the Owners
(collectively, the " **Owner Indemnified Parties** ") shall be indemnified
against and in respect of any and all Losses caused by or resulting or
arising from (i) any inaccuracy in, any breach of, or any failure to
perform or comply with, any of the Purchasers representations, warranties
or agreements contained in this Agreement (limited to breaches, or failures
to perform or comply, occurring at or before the Closing) (other than with
respect to any matter addressed in clauses (ii) through (v)); (ii) any
third party advisor fees and expenses and other out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by any BFI Entity in connection with the negotiation and
finalization of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and the
completion of the Transactions if and to the extent that such fees and
expense are (x) materially more in the aggregate than the estimate of third
party advisor fees and expenses provided by the Fund to IESI prior to the
date of this Agreement and (y) unreasonable; (iii) an inaccuracy or breach of
_Section 4.3.1_ (but solely with respect to the Participating Preferred
Shares and ownership interests in the Fund); (iv) any Tantalo Owner Amount
(as defined below); and (v) any Seneca Meadows Owner Tax Amount (as defined
below) (in each case an " **Owner Loss** "), in each case by (and only by) the
Fund issuing Units (or, at its option, paying cash) to the Owners in
accordance with _Section 6.4_.

  



  

6.2.2. The Owner Representative, on behalf of any of the Owner Indemnified
Parties shall promptly after any of them becomes aware of any circumstance
which might reasonably be expected to become the subject matter of a claim to
be made by any of them under _Section 6.2_ (an " **Owner Claim**
") including any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim
against any of them or the Fund by a third party (for purposes of this
section, " **Third-Party Claim** "), advise the Fund of such
circumstance, and shall provide the Fund, from time to time, such information
as the Fund shall reasonably request in connection therewith; provided that
any delay or failure to so advise the Fund shall not affect the rights of the
Owner Indemnified Parties hereunder except to the extent that the Fund is
prejudiced by such delay or failure. The Fund shall have exclusive control
and discretion in the conduct of the defence of any Third-Party Claim;
provided that the Owner Representative shall be permitted to retain
one separate counsel on behalf of the Owners, at the Funds expense in
respect of a Third-Party Claim (satisfied exclusively out of the Cap Amount)
(i) for which the Owner Representative shall have been advised by counsel
that there are one or more legal or equitable defences available

  



  

69   

     
   

  



  

to the Owners and, in the reasonable opinion of the Owner Representative,
counsel for the Fund could not adequately represent the interests of the
Owners because such interests could be in conflict with those of the Fund or
(ii) the Fund shall not have assumed the defence within 20 days of receiving
notice thereof. The Fund shall not settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim
or allow a default or consent to entry of any judgment with respect thereto
without obtaining an unqualified and full release of the Owners in connection
therewith. The Owner Representative shall also have the right to employ
separate counsel in any action brought in respect of any matter which is or
may be the subject of a Third-Party Claim for indemnification hereunder, and
shall have the right to participate in the defence thereof, but the fees and
expenses related thereto, including fees and expenses of counsel, shall be at
the expense of the Owners except as otherwise permitted by the second
sentence of this _Section 6.2.2_. The assumption of control and conduct of
the defence by the Fund of any matter which might reasonably be expected to
become Third-Party Claim shall not constitute an acknowledgement by the Fund
of any Qualifying Owner Loss, the procedures for determining such Qualifying
Owner Loss being set forth in _Section 6.5_.

  



  

6.2.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the
event of a Owner Loss, the Fund shall not be required to issue Units (or, at
its option, pay cash) in accordance with _Section 6.4_:

  



  

6.2.3.1. except with respect to any Owner Loss described in clauses (ii)
through (v) of _Section 6.2.1_, until such time as the aggregate of all
indemnifiable Owner Losses exceeds the Basket Amount, at which time, subject
to _Section 6.2.3.2,_ all such amounts shall be indemnifiable hereunder,
excluding the Basket Amount;

  



  

6.2.3.2. after such time as the aggregate of all indemnifiable Purchaser
Losses exceeds an amount equal to the applicable Cap Amount;

  



  

6.2.3.3. unless such claim is asserted in writing on or prior to the
Expiration Date;

  



  

6.2.3.4. unless and until such time as such Owner Loss is determined to be a
Qualifying Owner Loss in accordance with _Section 6.5_; and

  



  

6.2.3.5. in the case of a breach of _Section 4.29_ (Prospectus Disclosure)
or _Section 4.30_ (Proxy Materials) or of the agreements set forth in
_Sections 5.8.3_ and _5.10.4_ , unless and solely to the extent that such
Owner Loss involves Losses arising from a claim against the Fund or its
Affiliates by a Unitholder under the Prospectus or Proxy Materials, as the
case may be, or by an underwriter under the Underwriting Agreement entered
into in connection with the Offering.

  



  

 **6.3** ** _Termination of Indemnity Rights under Articl_ _e VI_**

  



  

The provisions of this _Article VI_ shall terminate and have no further
effect on and after the date that is the second anniversary of the Closing
Date (the " **Expiration Date** ");

  



  

70   

     
   

  



  

provided, that in the event that there is any Open Claim for Loss on the
Expiration Date, the relevant provisions of this _Article VI_ shall continue
to apply with respect to such Open Claim for Loss until such time as such
Open Claim for Loss has been resolved pursuant to _Section 6.5_.

Securityholders Agreement.

  



  

6.4.3. In the event that the aggregate of the outstanding Qualifying
Purchaser Losses as of the Expiration Date exceeds the aggregate of the

Agreement and (ii) the applicable Expiration Date Net Purchaser Loss Escrow
Shares shall be transferred to IESI and cancelled.

6.4.5. In the event that there are any Open Purchaser Claims for Loss as of
the First Anniversary or the Expiration Date, upon resolution of any such
Open Purchaser Claim for Loss pursuant to _Section 6.5_, if there is

Owner Claim for Loss pursuant to _Section 6.5_, if there is determined to be
a Qualifying Owner Loss with respect to such Open Owner Claim for Loss, the
Fund shall issue the applicable number of Qualifying Owner Loss Units (or, at
the option of the Fund, pay in cash the Qualifying Owner Loss) to the Owners
pro rata on the basis of the ownership percentages set forth on Schedule I of
the Securityholders Agreement.

  



  

6.4.7. In the event that an Open Claim for Loss is determined to be a

Owner Representative (in the event of a Qualifying Purchaser Loss) or the
Fund (in the event of a Qualifying Owner Loss) stating the amount of the
Qualifying Loss and providing evidence reasonably sufficient to the parties
that such Open Claim has been determined to be a Qualifying Loss. In the
event of a Qualifying Purchaser Loss, the Fund may, at its option, (i)
require that the applicable number of Qualifying Purchaser Loss Shares be
transferred to IESI and cancelled as of the date on which the Open Purchaser

Securityholders Agreement. Upon such redemption or issuance, as the case
may be, such shares shall cease to be considered "outstanding" for purpose of
_Sections 6.2.1_ through _6.4.4_.

  



  

 **6.5** ** _Claim Procedures; Determination of Net Los_ _s_**

  



  

The procedure for determining Purchaser Losses and Owner Losses for purposes
of _Section 6.4_ shall be as follows:

  



  

6.5.1. If from time to time, the Fund or the Owner Representative (the party
claiming a loss, a " **Claiming Party** ") determines in good faith that there
has been a Purchaser Loss or an Owner Loss, as the case may be, such Claiming
Party shall provide written notice to the Owner Representative (in the case
of a claimed Purchaser Loss) or the Fund (in the case of a claimed Owner
Loss), as the case may be (such party, the " **Subject Party**
"), describing the nature of the claim for such loss, the amount thereof, and
the provisions in this Agreement on which such claim for loss is based and,
to the extent applicable, the relevant Section of the Prospectus or
Proxy Materials on which such claim is based (such notice, a " **Claim
Notice** ").

  



  

6.5.2. If the Claiming Party does not receive written objection to a claim
pursuant to _Section 6.5.1_ within 15 Business Days after delivery of the
applicable Claim Notice, the loss claimed by the Claiming Party shall be
deemed to be approved and accepted by the relevant Subject Party and shall be
considered a " **Qualifying Purchaser Loss** " (if the Claiming Party is the
Fund) or a " **Qualifying Owner Loss** " (if the Claiming Party is the
Owner Representative), as the case may be, for purposes of _Section 6.4_.
Qualifying Purchaser Losses and Qualifying Owner Losses are referred to
collectively as " **Qualifying Losses**."

  



  

6.5.3. If within the 15 Business Day period following delivery of the
relevant Claim Notice the Claiming Party receives from the relevant Subject
Party a written objection to such Claiming Partys claim for loss, specifying
the nature of and grounds for such objection, then such claim for loss shall
be deemed an " **Open Purchaser Claim for Loss** " (if the Claiming Party is
the Fund) or an " **Open Owner Claim for Loss** " (if the Claiming Party is
the Owner Representative), as the case may be, for purposes of _Section
6.4_. Open Purchaser Claim for Loss and Open Owner Claim for Loss are
referred to collectively as " **Open Claim for Loss** ".

  



  

6.5.4. If the relevant Claiming Party receives a notice of objection pursuant
to _Section 6.5.3_, the relevant Claiming Party and Subject Party shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections and, to the extent
they agree that a Loss is indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 6.1_ or
_Section 6.2_, as the case may be, the agreed amount of such Loss shall be
considered a Qualifying Loss for purposes of _Section 6.4_. If the Claiming
Party and the Subject Party do not reach a final resolution within 20
Business Days after delivery of the notice of objection described in _Section
6.5.3_, the dispute arising out of or respecting the Claiming Partys claim
for loss and the written objection thereto (under _Section 6.5.3_) shall be
determined by arbitration in accordance with the International Arbitration
Rules of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (" **Rules**
"), subject to

  



  

73   

     
   

  



  

the provisions set forth in _Exhibit 6.5.4_. If the arbitral tribunal
determines that the Subject Party is liable to the Claiming Party for any
Loss, the amount of such Loss (which in no event shall be greater than the
amount originally claimed by the Claiming Party) shall be considered a
Qualifying Loss for purposes of _Section 6.4_ above.

  



  

6.5.5. The calculation of the amount of any indemnifiable Loss and the
consequent adjustment of the relative ownership interests of the Owners shall
be made such that following indemnification with respect to any such Loss
pursuant to this _Article VI_, the pro forma ownership interest of the
Owners (based on the number of Participating Preferred Shares held by such
Owners at such time on an As-if-Exchanged Basis) relative to the pro forma
ownership of the holders of Units (not including any Participating Preferred
Shares on an As-if-Exchanged Basis) shall be increased or decreased, as the
case may be, in an amount the value of which equates to the amount of such
Loss. In the case of a Qualifying Owner Loss indemnified by the Fund with a
cash payment, such cash payment shall be calculated in a manner consistent
with the foregoing principle.

  



  

 **6.6** ** _Additional Provisions_**

  



  

6.6.1. Except in the case of fraud, from and after the Closing, the
provisions of this _Article VI_ shall be the exclusive basis for the
assertion of claims (other than claims for specific performance against) or
the imposition of liability on, any Party under this Agreement.

  



  

6.6.2. The representations and warranties, covenants and agreements in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive until the Expiration Date.

  



  

6.6.3. For the avoidance of doubt and subject to _Section 6.4.7_, upon a
dividend payment or distribution made in respect of the Escrow Shares by
IESI, IESI shall distribute such dividend or distribution to Owners pro rata
on the basis of the ownership percentages set forth on Schedule I of the
Securityholders Agreement. Each Owner shall be entitled to vote its
proportionate number of Escrow Shares until such time as such shares are
transferred and cancelled pursuant to _Section 6.4_.

  



  

6.6.4. The Purchaser Indemnified Party and each of the Owner Indemnified
Parties shall each use its reasonable commercial efforts to mitigate any
Purchaser Loss or any Owner Loss, respectively.

  



  

 **6.7** ** _Tantalo Matter; Seneca Meadows Tax Matter_**

  



  

6.7.1. As of the Expiration Date (or at any times prior thereto if the
applicable matters are then determinable with certainty), the Purchaser
Indemnified Party or the Owner Representative may calculate: (i) the sum of
(A) all remediation costs with respect to the Tantalo landfill incurred by
any IESI Entity after the date hereof and before the Expiration Date plus (B)
the good faith best estimate of any additional remediation costs most likely
to be incurred by an IESI Entity with respect to the Tantalo
landfill thereafter (collectively, the " **Tantalo Remediation Costs**
"); less (ii) the sum of (A) all

  



  

74   

     
   

  



  

funds recovered from the defendants in the pending cost recovery action with
respect to the Tantalo landfill by an IESI Entity after the date hereof and
before the Expiration Date plus (B) the good faith best estimate of any
additional funds most likely to be recovered from the defendants in the
pending cost recovery action with respect to the Tantalo landfill by an IESI
Entity thereafter (collectively, the " **Tantalo Cost Recovery** "). The
excess of the Tantalo Remediation Costs over the Tantalo Cost Recovery is
referred to herein as the " **Net Tantalo Costs** ".  Subject to the
applicable limitations in _Section 6.1.3_, the Purchaser Indemnified Party
shall be indemnified pursuant to _Section 6.1_, to the extent that it is
determined in accordance with _Section 6.5_ that the Net Tantalo Costs
exceed $8,000,000, for the amount of any such Net Tantalo Costs in excess of
$8,000,000  (the " **Tantalo Purchaser Amount** ") in accordance with
_Section 6.4_.  Subject to the applicable limitations in _Section 6.2.3_,
the Owner Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified pursuant to _Section
6.2_, to the extent it is determined in accordance with _Section 6.5_
that the Net Tantalo Costs are less than $8,000,000, for the amount equal to
the difference of $8,000,000 less the amount of the Net Tantalo Costs
(such difference, the " **Tantalo Owner Amount** ") in accordance with
_Section 6.4_.

  



  

6.7.2. As of the Expiration Date (or at any times prior thereto if the
applicable matters are then determinable with certainty), the Purchaser
Indemnified Party or the Owner Representative may calculate the sum of; (i)
all Excess Section 338(h)(10) Taxes paid by any IESI Entity pursuant to
Section 10.2(b) of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of May 22, 2003, by
and among IESI NY Corporation, as Buyer, Frank DiMino, as Seller, Seneca
Meadows, Inc. and Macedon Homes Incorporated with respect to the purchase of
all of the shares of Seneca Meadows, Inc. from the date hereof to the
Expiration Date plus (ii) the good faith best estimate of all such additional
Excess Section 338(h)(10) Taxes most likely to be payable by an IESI Entity
thereafter. (collectively, " **Seneca Meadows Tax Payments** ").  Subject to
the applicable limitations in _Section 6.1.3_, the Purchaser Indemnified
Party shall be indemnified pursuant to _Section 6.1_, to the extent that it
is determined in accordance with _Section 6.5_ that the Seneca Meadows Tax
Payments exceed $300,000, for the amount of any such Seneca Meadows Tax
Payments in excess of $300,000 (the " **Seneca Meadows Purchaser Tax Amount**
") in accordance with _Section 6.4_.  Subject to the applicable limitations
in _Section 6.2.3_, the Owner Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified
pursuant to _Section 6.2_, to the extent that it is determined in accordance
with _Section 6.5_ that the Seneca Meadows Tax Payments are less than
$300,000, for the amount equal to the difference of $300,000 less the amount
of the Seneca Meadows Tax Payments (such difference, the " **Seneca Meadows
Owner Tax Amount** ") in accordance with _Section 6.4_.

  



  

6.7.3. As of the Expiration Date (or at any times prior thereto if the
applicable matters are then determinable with certainty), the Purchaser
Indemnified Party may calculate the sum of: (i) any payment required to be
made by any IESI Entity to any of Messrs. Brown, Cowee, Flood, Fowler, Moody,
McGee or Peckham (the " **Relevant Employees** ") pursuant to the terms of
Section 2(e) of their respective New Employment Agreements (as executed on
the date hereof) to "gross up" such Person for the imposition of the excise
tax under Section 4999 of the Code on any "excess parachute payment"
(including penalties and interest) paid to such Person in connection with the
Transactions

  



  

75   

     
   

  



  

(collectively, " **Excise Tax Reimbursements** "), plus (ii) provided that
no Purchaser Indemnified Party has initiated any discussions or inquiries
with any taxing authority with respect to such taxes, any Loss arising solely
from a challenge made by a taxing authority and which is associated with
the disallowance of any federal income tax deduction of any IESI Entity (and
any corresponding state or local tax deduction) under Section 280G of the
Code with respect to any "excess parachute payment" (including penalties and
interest) made in connection with Transaction-related payments to the
Relevant Employees, provided that such Loss shall be reduced to take account
of any net Tax benefit obtained by the relevant IESI Entity arising from (A)
the incurrence or payment of any such claim or tax and (B) any correlative
adjustments or changes in tax treatment that occur as a result of the
adjustment or change giving rise to such tax (the " **280G Tax Losses** ")
plus (iii) provided that no Purchaser Indemnified Party has initiated any
discussions or inquiries with any taxing authority with respect to such
taxes, the good faith best estimate (based upon an assessment of the
probability of challenges from taxing authorities, the probability of success
of such challenges, and the probability of the amount of the claims which
would result therefrom) of the amounts, if any, set forth in clauses (i) and
(ii) above which are most likely to be incurred thereafter by any IESI Entity
(such estimate together with the Excise Tax Reimbursements and the 280G Tax
Losses, collectively, the "Excess Parachute Amount"). The Purchasers
agree to vigorously defend any challenges from taxing authorities regarding
Excise Tax Reimbursements and 280G Tax Losses, and the Owner Representative
shall be entitled to participate therein in the manner and to the extent
provided in _Section 6.1_. Subject to the applicable limitations set forth
in _Section 6.1.3_, the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be indemnified
pursuant to _Section 6.1.1_ and in accordance with _Section 6.4_ for the
amount of any Excess Parachute Amount determined in accordance with _Section
6.5_.

  



  

6.7.4. If as of the First Anniversary, the Purchaser Indemnified Party or the
Owner Representative, in good faith and on a reasonable basis, determines
that it is reasonably likely that it will seek indemnification for a Tantalo
Purchaser Amount or Tantalo Owner Amount, respectively, or for a Seneca
Meadows Purchaser Tax Amount or Seneca Meadows Owner Tax Amount,
respectively, or an Excess Parachute Amount in the case of the Purchaser
Indemnified Party, such party may declare such claim an Open Purchaser Claim
for Loss or Open Owner Claim for Loss, respectively, for the purposes of
_Sections 6.4.1_ and _6.4.2_ ; provided, that such Open Purchaser Claim for
Loss or Open Owner Claim for Loss will not be settled in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 6.5_ and will remain an Open Purchaser Claim for Loss
or Open Owner Claim for Loss, as applicable, until provided by _Section
6.7.1_ or _6.7.2_ , as applicable (any such claim, a " **Protective Claim**
"). In the event that the Purchaser Indemnified Party or the Owner
Representative makes a Protective Claim which the other party, in good faith,
disputes, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute,
and if the parties do not reach a final resolution within 20 Business Days
then the determination as to whether the claim constitutes a valid Protective
Claim and the amount thereof shall be determined by arbitration in accordance
with the Rules, subject to the provisions set forth in _Exhibit 6.5.4_.
