SECTION 2.06. [Reserved]



SECTION 2.07. Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
Reorganized RentPath) will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise deliverable under this Agreement, and from any other
payments otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as the
Buyer or its Affiliates are required to deduct and withhold with respect to
any such deliveries and payments under applicable Law; provided, however, that
if any of the Buyer or its Affiliates determines that any applicable Law
requires any deduction or withholding from any such deliveries or payments,
the Buyer or such Affiliate, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide notice to the party receiving such delivery or payment no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the date of such delivery or
payment and shall reasonably cooperate with such receiving party in securing
any available reduction or exemption from such deduction or withholding. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld, they will be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to such Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

SECTION 2.08. Transferred Contracts.

(a) Schedule 1.01 sets forth a complete list of all Transferred Contracts that
the Buyer intends to assume at Closing. As promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date hereof, Sellers will provide Buyer with a list of Contracts
and Leases not listed on Schedule 1.01 as of the date hereof, including any
Contracts or Leases entered into following the date hereof (each, an "Unlisted
Contract"), together with a copy of such Contract or Lease.

(b) At any time prior to the date that is twenty-one (21) days prior to the
Confirmation Hearing (or, in the case of an Unlisted Contract, any applicable
deadline set forth in the Confirmation Order), Buyer will have the right
(exercisable in the Buyer's sole discretion), but not the obligation, to
provide written notice to the Sellers of Buyer's election to designate a
Contract or Lease, in each case, Related to the Business, not designated as a
Transferred Contract as a Transferred Contract, and upon such designation such
Transferred Contract will constitute an Acquired Asset and such Transferred
Contract and will be conveyed to Buyer under, and in accordance with the terms
of, this Agreement at Closing (and, if applicable, will cease to constitute an
Excluded Asset), so long as such Contract or Lease is added to the list of
Transferred Contracts prior to the entry of any order of the Bankruptcy Court
approving the rejection of such Contract or Lease.

(c) To the extent that Buyer makes a valid designation with respect to any
Contracts or Leases pursuant to clause (b) above, the applicable Exhibits and
Schedules to this Agreement will be deemed to have automatically been updated
(without action of any Party or Person) to reflect such designation.

(d) If Buyer exercises its rights in clause (b) above to designate a Contract
or Lease as a Transferred Contract, then the Parties acknowledge and agree
that there will be no reduction in, or increase to, the Purchase Price as a
result of such designation or change in designation; provided, however, that
such designation may increase or decrease (as applicable) the extent of the
Assumed Liabilities, Acquired Assets and/or Excluded Assets.



(e) If Buyer exercises its rights in clause (b) above to designate a Contract
or Lease as a Transferred Contract, then (i) Buyer agrees that it will
promptly take such actions as are reasonably requested by the Sellers to
assist in obtaining a finding of adequate assurance of future performance as
required under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to each such Transferred
Contract and (ii) Sellers will promptly deliver, to the applicable third party
to such Contract, information evidencing Buyer's adequate assurance of future
performance.

(f) The Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to timely file all
pleadings with the Bankruptcy Court as are necessary or appropriate to secure
entry of the Confirmation Order effecting the sale of the Acquired Assets free
and clear of Liabilities and Liens to the maximum extent permitted by the
Bankruptcy Code (other than Assumed Liabilities and Permitted Liens).

(g) At the Closing and pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, the
Sellers will assume the Transferred Contracts (to the extent not previously
assumed) and assign the Transferred Contracts to the Buyer. The Cure Costs
necessary to permit the assumption and assignment of the Transferred Contracts
as contemplated herein will be paid at the Closing by the Sellers, provided,
that, solely to the extent any such Cure Costs remain disputed as of the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall pay such Cure Costs as and when finally
determined by the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to the procedures set forth in the
Confirmation Order.

SECTION 2.09. Transaction Structure. Pursuant to and in accordance with this
Section 2.09 and Section 5.14, the Buyer agrees to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by acquiring all of the newly issued shares of
Reorganized RentPath (the "Reorganized Equity") free and clear of all Liens
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the
Plan and the Confirmation Order (the "Stock Transaction"), as specifically set
forth in Exhibit E, instead of directly effectuating the sales, transfers,
assignments, conveyances, deliveries and assumptions set forth in Sections
2.01 and 2.02; provided, the Buyer shall acquire the Reorganized Equity free
and clear of all Liens, only after (x) all of the existing equity, all rights
to equity and all rights to acquire equity of the Company are cancelled, (y)
the discharge, release and/or exculpation (and injunction) of all Excluded
Liabilities and Liens (other than Permitted Liens) on the Acquired Assets
pursuant to the Plan and Confirmation Order and (z) the transfer, assumption
and assignment of all Excluded Assets (including the equity in Subsidiaries of
the Company and any other equity interests held by the Company in other
Persons) and Excluded Liabilities to the Wind Down Co., as provided in the
Plan and Confirmation Order, such that immediately prior to the Buyer
acquiring the Reorganized Equity, the only assets and liabilities held by
Reorganized RentPath shall be the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities. The
consideration payable by the Buyer in respect of the Stock Transaction shall
be the Purchase Price, and for the avoidance of doubt, all cash consideration
paid by the Buyer to satisfy the Purchase Price under this Section 2.09 shall
be paid to an account designated by the Sellers or Wind Down Co., as
applicable. All of the terms set forth in this Agreement shall be applicable
and fully enforceable with respect to such Stock Transaction in a manner that
gives effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.09.



SECTION 2.10. Holdback Escrow. At the Closing, the Buyer shall deposit (or
cause to be deposited) an amount equal to the Holdback Amount with the Escrow
Agent to be held pursuant to the terms of the Holdback Escrow Agreement (the
"Holdback Escrow"). Such amount delivered to the Escrow Agent, together with
any investment proceeds thereon, and subject to any reduction for
distributions made pursuant to the terms of the Holdback Escrow Agreement, are
referred to herein, collectively, as the "Holdback Funds". If the Buyer or a
Buyer Related Party (including, following the Closing, Reorganized RentPath)
suffers, sustains or incurs any Holdback Liabilities, it shall promptly
provide reasonably detailed written evidence of such Holdback Liabilities to
the other Parties (a "Holdback Notice").

The Holdback Funds shall be distributed as follows:

(a) following the Closing, if the Buyer or a Buyer Related Party (including,
following the Closing, Reorganized RentPath) suffers, sustains or incurs any
Holdback Liabilities, the Sellers and the Buyer shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent within two (2) Business Days after a Holdback
Notice is duly delivered (or, if a Party disputes the nature or amount of the
liabilities described in the Holdback Notice, within two (2) Business Days
after such dispute is resolved), which joint written instruction shall direct
the Escrow Agent to release Holdback Funds in an amount equal to such Holdback
Liabilities to an account designated by Buyer or such Buyer Related Party;

(b) after the occurrence of the Sellers' administrative claims bar date (the
"Administrative Claims Bar Date"), within five (5) Business Days following the
Buyer's receipt from Sellers (or Wind Down Co.) of an analysis (with
supporting material) of the then-outstanding claims asserted against any
Seller, any Seller Related Party or Wind Down Co. with respect to any
Specified Tax Liabilities (such claims, including any such similar claims
asserted against Buyer or a Buyer Related Party (including, following the
Closing, Reorganized RentPath), the "Specified Tax Liabilities Claims"), the
Sellers and the Buyer shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to Wind Down Co. the difference
between (i) $5,000,000 minus (ii) the Specified Tax Liabilities Claims, which
resulting number, if negative, shall be deemed to be zero; the amount of the
Holdback Funds not so released are referred to herein, collectively, as the
"Remaining Holdback"; and

(c) on the first (1st) Business Day following the date that is twelve (12)
months after the Administrative Claims Bar Date, any amounts remaining in the
Remaining Holdback shall be released to an account designated by Wind Down
Co., provided that the amount of the Remaining Holdback equal to the amount of
any then-outstanding claims with respect to (x) the Specified Tax Liabilities
Claims and (y) any other Holdback Liabilities that are then-outstanding
against the Buyer or a Buyer Related Party (including, following the Closing,
Reorganized RentPath), if any, shall be held until, and promptly released to
Wind Down Co. or Buyer or such Buyer Related Party following, resolution of
such Specified Tax Liabilities Claims or claims with respect to such Holdback
Liabilities (as applicable).





ARTICLE III 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS

Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Sellers are delivering to the Buyer the Schedules with numbered sections
corresponding to the relevant sections in this Agreement. Any exception,
qualification, limitation, document or other item described in any provision,
subprovision, section or subsection of any schedule of the Schedules with
respect to a particular representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be an exception or qualification with respect to all other
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement to the extent that
it is reasonably apparent on its face that such exception, qualification,
limitation, document or other item is applicable to such other representations
and warranties. Nothing in the Schedules shall broaden the scope of any
representation or warranty of the Sellers contained in this Agreement. Neither
the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty
contained in this Article III nor the inclusion of any information in the
Schedules shall be deemed to (a) imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, are or are not material or (b) be an admission or acknowledgment, in
and of itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be
disclosed, is material to the Sellers, has resulted in or would result in a
Material Adverse Effect or is outside the ordinary course of business (except
in each case to the extent responsive to a representation). Subject to the
foregoing, except as disclosed in the Schedules, the Sellers hereby represent
and warrant to the Buyer, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date
(except where such representation and warranty speaks only as of an earlier
date, in which case as of such earlier date), as follows:

SECTION 3.01. Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

(a) Each Seller is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to
the extent applicable) under the laws of the state of its formation,
incorporation or equivalent, and has, subject to the necessary authority from
the Bankruptcy Court, all requisite organizational power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets and to conduct its business as it
is currently being conducted. Each Seller is duly qualified and in good
standing to do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties or assets makes such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not result in material
Liabilities to such Seller. None of the Sellers own, directly or indirectly,
any equity interests of any Person other than equity interests of another
Seller.

(b) The Company or another Seller has made available to the Buyer true and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent
organizational and governing documents) of each Seller as currently in effect.

(c) As of the Closing, (i) the equity interests of Reorganized RentPath will
have been duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
free and clear of any Liens and will not have been issued in violation of any
applicable Law or right of any Person, including any preemptive rights or
other restriction pursuant to any Contract or otherwise, (ii) there will be no
options, warrants or rights of conversion or other similar rights, Contracts
or other



agreements, arrangements or commitments obligating Reorganized RentPath to
repurchase, issue or sell any of its equity interests or any phantom equity
rights, preferred interests or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
its equity interests and (iii) there will be no voting trusts, equityholder
agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect with respect to the voting
or transfer of the equity interests of Reorganized RentPath.

SECTION 3.02. Authority/Binding Effect. Subject to the Bankruptcy Court's
entry of the Bidding Procedures Order, the Confirmation Order and any other
Related Order to close the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with
this Agreement, each Seller has all requisite organizational power and
organizational authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Related
Agreements to which it is party, to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements by each Seller party thereto, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by such Seller, have been duly
authorized by all necessary organizational action on the part of such Seller,
and no other organizational action on the part of such Seller is required to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance hereof and thereof, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by such
Seller. This Agreement has been, and the Related Agreements will be, duly
executed and delivered by each Seller party hereto and thereto and, assuming
that this Agreement has been, and the Related Agreements will be, duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the other Parties and subject to the
Bankruptcy Court's entry of the Bidding Procedures Order, the Confirmation
Order and any other Related Order, constitute the valid and binding obligation
of such Seller, enforceable against such Seller in accordance with their
respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws of general
application affecting enforcement of creditors' rights or by principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or
in equity).

SECTION 3.03. Financial Statements. Attached hereto as Schedule 3.03 are
copies of (i) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet, as of December 31,
2019, of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the unaudited consolidated
statements of earnings and cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for the twelve (12)‑month period then ended
(such statements, the "Latest Financial Statements") and (ii) the audited
consolidated balance sheet, as of December 31, 2018, of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the audited consolidated statements of earnings and cash
flows and changes in stockholders' equity of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
together with the notes thereto, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018
(such statements and notes, together with the Latest Financial Statements, the
"Financial Statements"). The Financial Statements fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as of the date thereof, and the consolidated statements of
earnings and cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, for the periods set forth therein. Each of the Financial
Statements has been prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied,
except as otherwise noted therein, and subject, in the case of the Latest

individually or in the aggregate, material and the absence of footnote
disclosures. The Financial Statements are based upon the books and records of
the Sellers.



SECTION 3.04. Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

(a) Except for the transactions contemplated hereby, since January 1, 2019,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted the Business in the ordinary
course of business. Except for the transactions contemplated hereby, since the
date of the Latest Financial Statements and prior to the date of this
Agreement, no Seller has taken any action that, if taken during the period
from the date of this Agreement through the Closing without the Buyer's
consent, would constitute a breach of Section 5.01.

(b) Since January 1, 2019 to the date hereof, there has not occurred any
Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.05. Consents and Approvals/No Violation.

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each Seller does not, and
the execution and delivery of the Related Agreements by each Seller party
thereto will not, and the performance by such Seller of this Agreement and the
Related Agreements to which such Seller is party and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not, require such Seller to
obtain any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or to make any
declaration, filing with or notification to (collectively, "Consents"), any
federal, state or local court, tribunal, legislature, executive or regulatory
authority, agency, department, organization or commission, or other
governmental entity, authority or instrumentality, whether domestic or foreign
or any self-regulated organization or other non-governmental regulatory
authority or quasi-governmental authority or any arbitrator (each, a
"Governmental Authority") or other third party (other than any such Consent
that may be required from such other third party under any Contract that is
not a Material Contract), except (i) for compliance with the applicable
requirements, if any, of the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws, (ii) as
required or pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, the Bidding Procedures Order, the
Confirmation Order and any other Related Order, or (iii) for those Consents,
the failure of which to be obtained or made has not been and would not
reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the Sellers, taken as a
whole. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that no Seller shall be deemed in
breach of this Section 3.05(a) as a result of the breach of Section 4.03 by
the Buyer.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Seller does not, and
the execution and delivery of the Related Agreements to which such Seller is
party will not, and the performance of this Agreement and such Related
Agreements by such Seller and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby by such Seller will not, (i) conflict with or
violate the organizational documents of such Seller, (ii) assuming compliance
with the matters referred to in Section 3.05(a), conflict with or violate any
Law or Order applicable to such Seller or (iii) result in any breach of, or
constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute a default) under, any Material Contract to which such Seller
is a party or by or to which such Seller is bound or subject, except (A) in
each case, as set forth on Schedule 3.05(b) and (B) in the case of clauses
(ii) and (iii) above, for such conflicts, violations, breaches or defaults
that have not been and would not reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to the Sellers, taken as a whole.



SECTION 3.06. Absence of Actions.

(a) (i) There is no, and since January 1, 2017 there has been no Action
pending or, to the knowledge of the Sellers, threatened in writing against any
Seller and (ii) no Seller is a party to or subject to, or in default under,
any judgment, writ, injunction, stipulation, determination, award, order or
decree of any Governmental Authority ("Order") that, in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii) above, has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to
result in a material Liability of the Sellers, taken as a whole.

(b) There is no, and since January 1, 2017, there has been no, Action pending
or threatened by any Seller against any other Person.

SECTION 3.07. Affiliate Transactions. No current or former officer, director
or manager of any Seller or any Person who beneficially owns or has owned one
percent (1%) or more of the equity of any Seller or any of their immediate
family members or Affiliates is a party to any Contract with or binding upon
any Seller or has any interest in any material Acquired Asset or has engaged
in any material transaction with any Seller within the past twenty four (24)
months other than, in each case, employment arrangements between any such
employee or independent director and the Sellers entered into in the ordinary
course of business. No portfolio company of any private equity fund managed by
Providence Equity Partners L.L.C., TPG Global, LLC or RentPath Gives Back
Foundation, Inc. is an Affiliate of a Seller or of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

SECTION 3.08. Permits/Compliance with Laws.

1, 2017 has been in compliance in all material respects, with all Material
Permits (as defined below) and all Laws applicable to the Business.

(b) (i) Each Seller possesses, and since January 1, 2017 has possessed, all
material Permits (the "Material Permits") required under applicable Laws to
carry on its respective businesses as currently being conducted and to lease
and own its respective properties and assets and (ii) all such Material
Permits are in full force and effect.

SECTION 3.09. No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except (a) to the extent reflected
in or reserved against in the Financial Statements, (b) for current
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date of the
Latest Financial Statements, (c) for liabilities incurred under, or
contemplated by, this Agreement or incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
liabilities resulting from the breach of this Agreement by the Sellers) or (d)
as has not been, and would not reasonably be expected to be material to the
Sellers, taken as whole, no Seller has any Liabilities required by GAAP to be
set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the Sellers.

SECTION 3.10. Employee Benefit Plans/ERISA.

(a) Schedule 3.10(a) sets forth a true and complete list of each material
Employee Benefit Plan (provided, that, Schedule 3.10(a) shall be deemed to
include any Employee Benefit



Plan that is first entered into or becomes effective following the date hereof
and prior to the Closing Date if such Employee Benefit Plan is permitted to be
entered into or become effective under Section 5.01(b) hereof). With respect
to each material Employee Benefit Plan, the Sellers have made available to the
Buyer true and complete copies of each of the following documents, as
applicable: (i) a copy of the Employee Benefit Plan (including all amendments
thereto), (ii) a copy of the most recent annual report required under ERISA or
the Code, (iii) a copy of the most recent summary plan description required
under ERISA, (iv) if the Employee Benefit Plan is funded through a trust or
any third‑party funding vehicle, a copy of the trust or other funding
agreement (including all amendments thereto) and (v) the most recent IRS
determination, advisory or opinion letter.

(b) Each Employee Benefit Plan was established and has been administered, in
all material respects, in accordance with its terms and in compliance with
applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Each Employee Benefit Plan that
is intended to be tax qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received,
is covered by or has applied for a favorable determination letter from the IRS
or utilizes a prototype or volume submitter plan document that is the subject
of a favorable opinion or advisory letter issued by the IRS to the sponsor of
such prototype or volume submitter plan document and, to the knowledge of the
Sellers, nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to result in
the loss of such qualification.

(c) None of the Sellers or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has in the
past six (6) years sponsored, maintained, contributed to, been obligated to
contribute to or had any Liability in respect of (i) any plan subject to
Section 412 of the Code, Section 302 of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) a
"multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. None of the
Employee Benefit Plans provide for post-employment life or health insurance
benefits or coverage for any current or former employee or individual
consultant or any beneficiary thereof, except (i) as may be required by
applicable Law, including, Part 6 of the Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA,
Section 4980B of the Code and similar state Laws, (ii) coverage through the
end of the month of termination of employment or service, (iii) disability
benefits attributable to disabilities occurring at or prior to termination of
employment or service, and (iv) conversion rights at the sole expense of the
converting individual. With respect to each group health plan benefiting any
current or former employee of the Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate that is
subject to Section 4980B of the Code, the Sellers and each ERISA Affiliate has
complied with the continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the
Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA except for any noncompliance
that would not reasonably be expected to result in any material Liability to
the Sellers, taken as a whole.

(d) There are no pending Actions or, to the knowledge of the Sellers, any
Actions threatened in writing or audit by any Governmental Authority with
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered
under any Employee Benefit Plan or otherwise involving any Employee Benefit
Plan (other than routine benefit claims, administrative appeals of such claims
and domestic relations order proceedings), which would reasonably be expected
to result in a material Liability of the Sellers, taken as a whole.

(e) Except as set forth in this Agreement or as set forth on Schedule 3.10(e),
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions



contemplated hereby (alone or together with any other event which standing
alone would not by itself trigger such entitlement or acceleration) will (i)
entitle any current or former director, officer, employee or individual
consultant of any Seller to severance pay or any other compensatory payment
from such Seller or (ii) accelerate the time of payment, funding or vesting,
or increase the amount of compensation or benefit due any current or former
director, officer, employee or individual consultant of such Seller.

(f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (alone or together with any other
event) will cause any amount to be nondeductible under Section 280G of the
Code or subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.

SECTION 3.11. Material Contracts.

(viii) any Contract for the sale of any of the assets or equity of any Seller

consideration in excess of $1,000,000 pursuant to which any Seller has
continuing obligations that are material (other than (A) any Contract that is
solely among the Sellers and (B) any Contract for the sale of obsolete or
unused inventory, equipment or similar assets);

(ix) any Contract with respect to the acquisition by any Seller of any Person
(whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or otherwise), any business
or division of any Person or any material properties or assets of another
Person, in each case, pursuant to which any Seller has (A) continuing

Contract available to the Buyer. Each Material Contract is a valid and binding
agreement of the Sellers, enforceable against the Sellers, and to the
knowledge of the Sellers, the counterparties thereto, in each case in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws of
general application affecting enforcement of creditors' rights or by
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity) and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not result in (x) a default or an event of
default under any Material Contract or (y) any counterparty to a Material
Contract having a right to terminate, accelerate or assert any other similar
right with respect to, such Material Contract pursuant to the express terms of
such Material Contract. No Seller is, or has received any written notice since
September 30, 2019 that it or any other party is, in default under, any
Material Contract. To the knowledge of the Sellers, there has not occurred any
event that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would
constitute such a default under any Material Contract. Since September 30,
2019 no Seller has received any written notice from any party to any Material
Contract that such party intends to terminate or not renew such Material
Contract.



SECTION 3.12. Environmental Matters.

(a) Each Seller has been, since January 1, 2010, and to the knowledge of the
Sellers, prior to January 1, 2010, in compliance with all applicable

not limited to, the possession by such Seller of all Material Permits required
under applicable Environmental Laws, and compliance with the terms and
conditions thereof).

(b) Since January 1, 2010, and to the knowledge of the Sellers, prior to

(o) permit the lapse (without renewal or replacement) of any existing

SECTION 5.02. Control of Operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give the Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of the Business prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the
Sellers shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over their respective operations.

SECTION 5.03. Reasonable Best Efforts/Cooperation. From and after the date of
this Agreement, and through the earlier of the Closing and the date on which
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VII, each of the
Parties shall, and the Buyer shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use its
respective reasonable best efforts (unless, with respect to any action,
another standard of performance is expressly provided for herein (including in
Section 5.05(c))) to take, or



cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done all things,
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms set
forth herein as promptly as practicable, including satisfaction, but not
waiver, of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI.

SECTION 5.04. Consents. Without limiting the generality of Section 5.03, each
of the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain, and the
Buyer shall cause its Affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain (unless, in each case, with respect to any action, another standard of
performance is expressly provided for herein (including in Section 5.05(c))),
all Consents of all Governmental Authorities and other Persons as may be
necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement prior to the Closing, including by timely making or causing
to be made all filings and submissions under applicable Law as may be required
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary (other than
as contemplated by Section 5.05), none of the Sellers or the Buyer shall have
any obligation to agree to amend or modify any Contract or pay any fee to any
third party (including filing or other fees payable to Governmental
Authorities) for the purpose of obtaining any such Consent, or any costs and
expenses of any third party resulting from the process of obtaining such
Consent, except to the extent expressly required by any such Contract or
applicable Law. The Parties agree that any such Consent containing terms and
conditions adversely affecting the Buyer, if any (the "Buyer Related Terms and
Conditions"), must be reasonably acceptable to the Buyer. If the Buyer does
not approve of the Buyer Related Terms and Conditions, any resulting failure
to obtain the applicable Consent shall not constitute a failure by the Sellers
to use reasonable best efforts to obtain such Consent. Buyer acknowledges that
certain Consents and waivers with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be required from the parties to Contracts or Leases to
which a Seller is a party and that obtaining such Consents is not a condition
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. If such Consent
is not obtained, or if an attempted assignment or transfer thereof would
otherwise be ineffective pursuant to applicable Law, such Acquired Asset will
not be transferred or assigned until Consent is obtained or such transfer or
assignment would become effective pursuant to applicable Law, and Sellers and
Buyer will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement that would not
materially impair or materially delay the wind-down of Wind Down Co. under
which Buyer would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations thereunder in
accordance with this Agreement, including subcontracting, sub-licensing, or
sub-leasing to Buyer, or under which such Sellers would enforce their rights
thereunder for the benefit of Buyer with Buyer assuming such Sellers'
obligations and any and all rights of such Sellers against a third party
thereto.

SECTION 5.05. Antitrust Notifications and Other Regulatory Approvals.

(a) Each of the Parties shall, and the Buyer and Sellers shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, cooperate with each other and shall use, and the
Buyer and Sellers shall cause their respective Affiliates to use, their
respective reasonable best efforts to prepare and file as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement HSR Act Notification and Report Forms
with the FTC and the DOJ (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement absent mutual agreement by the Parties). As
soon as reasonably practicable, each of the Parties shall make, and the Buyer
and Seller shall cause their respective Affiliates to make, any other filings



and submissions in other jurisdictions as are mutually agreed by the Parties,
if any, and shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, substantially comply
with supplemental information or documentation requested by any Governmental
Authority, if any, in connection with the transaction(s) contemplated by this
Agreement. The Buyer shall pay all required filing fees in connection with the
notifications, filings, registrations, submissions or other materials
contemplated by this Section 5.05. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement
and applicable Laws or Orders, the Parties shall, and the Buyer shall cause
its Affiliates to, coordinate and cooperate fully and promptly with each other
in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other
parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking
early termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act.

(b) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law or Order, each Party shall
promptly notify the other Parties of the substance of any submission,
correspondence, communication, or meeting between it or its Representatives
and any Governmental Authority that relate to the subject matter of this
Section 5.05 or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent
practicable, each Party shall consult with the other Parties in advance
regarding any such submission, correspondence, communication or meeting, shall
consider in good faith the views of such Party, and shall provide the other
Parties with the opportunity to participate in any such communication or
meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Buyer shall, in
consultation with the Sellers, determine the strategy to be pursued for
obtaining and lead the effort to obtain all necessary actions or nonactions
and Consents from Governmental Entities in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Sellers shall take all reasonable
actions to support the Buyer in connection therewith; provided, however, that
Buyer shall not more than once, without prior written consent of the Sellers,
withdraw or seek to withdraw or refile its HSR notification or cause the
Sellers to do the same.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement requires the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (i) to litigate or
participate in the litigation of any proceeding under the Antitrust Laws or
involving the FTC or DOJ, whether judicial or administrative, or (ii) propose,
agree to, or accept any undertaking, or take any action that would prohibit or
limit the freedom of action with respect to, limit its ability to retain, or
place any conditions on, the ownership or operation by the Buyer or its
Affiliates of any portion of the business or assets of the Buyer or its
Affiliates, or the Sellers or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or compel the
Buyer or its Affiliates, or the Sellers or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
to dispose of, divest, hold separate, or license any portion of the assets or
Intellectual Property of the Buyer or its Affiliates or the Sellers or their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

(d) From the date of this Agreement through the date that is the latest of (i)
termination of the required waiting periods under the HSR Act, (ii) any
Consents of any other applicable Governmental Authority are obtained and (iii)
the Outside Date or, if earlier, the Closing Date or the date of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, the Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not directly or indirectly (A) effect or enter into any
discussions or negotiations with respect to any transaction, including
entering into any joint venture or acquiring or agreeing to acquire, by
merging with or into or consolidating with, or purchasing a substantial
portion of the assets of or any equity in, or by any other manner, any assets
or Person, or (B) subject to Section



5.05(b) and Section 5.05(c), take (or fail to take) any other action, in each
case that would reasonably be expected to delay or make more difficult the
obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the waiting periods under the HSR
Act, or the obtaining of such Consents from any applicable Governmental
Authorities.

SECTION 5.06. Bankruptcy Court Matters.

(a) Approval of Termination Payment.

(i) In the event that a Competing Bid is consummated, in consideration for the
Buyer having expended considerable time and expense in connection with this
Agreement and the negotiation thereof and the identification and
quantification of assets of the Sellers, the Sellers shall jointly and
severally, and without the requirement of any notice or demand from Buyer or
any application to or order of the Bankruptcy Court, pay (or cause to be paid
to) the Buyer, in accordance with the terms hereof and, subject to the entry
of and terms of the Bidding Procedures Order, a break-up fee in an amount
equal to two percent (2%) of the Purchase Price (the "Termination Payment");
provided, that Sellers shall not be required to pay the Termination Payment
if, prior to selecting a Competing Bid as the Successful Bid (as defined in
the Bidding Procedures), this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
Section 7.02 (other than a termination pursuant to Section 7.02(g)). Sellers
shall pay the Termination Payment in immediately available funds to such
account or accounts as may be specified in written notice by the Buyer. The
Termination Payment shall (a) constitute allowed administrative expenses of
Sellers' estates under section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code; and (b) be paid
on the second (2nd) Business Day following the date of consummation of a
Competing Bid from the proceeds of a Competing Bid if no material breach by
the Buyer of this Agreement has occurred. Nothing in this Section 5.06 shall
relieve the Buyer or the Sellers of any Liability for a breach of this
Agreement prior to the date of termination. Upon payment of the Termination
Payment to the Buyer in accordance with this Section 5.06(a), the Sellers and
their respective Representatives and Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Buyer and its Representatives and Affiliates, on the other, will be deemed to
have fully released and discharged each other from any Liabilities resulting
from the termination of this Agreement and neither the Sellers, their
Representatives or Affiliates, on the one hand, nor the Buyer, its
Representatives or Affiliates, on the other hand, or any other Person will
have any other remedy or cause of action under or relating to the termination
of this Agreement, including for reimbursement of expenses.

(ii) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained
in this Section 5.06(a) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other Parties would
not enter into this Agreement. Each of the Parties further acknowledges that
the payment by Sellers of the Termination Payment is not a penalty, but rather
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Buyer, in the
circumstances in which such Termination Payment is payable, for the efforts
and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The obligations to
return the Escrow Funds to the Buyer and pay the Termination Payment in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement will (1) be binding upon and
enforceable jointly and severally



against each Seller immediately upon the Bankruptcy Court's entering the
Bidding Procedures Order and (2) survive the subsequent termination of this
Agreement, solely to the extent permitted by applicable bankruptcy and non-
bankruptcy Laws. The obligations to return the Escrow Funds to the Buyer and
pay Buyer the Termination Payment, as and when required under this Agreement,
are intended to be, and upon entry of the Bidding Procedures Order are,
binding upon (A) each Seller, (B) any successors or assigns of any Seller, (C)
any trustee, examiner or other representative of a Seller's estate and (D)
Wind Down Co. (each of (A) through (D), a "Successor") as if such Successor
were a Seller hereunder.

(b) Competing Transaction. This Agreement is subject to approval of the
procedures set forth in the Bidding Procedures Order, and the consideration by
the Sellers of higher or better competing bids in respect of all or any part
of the Acquired Assets in accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order
(whether in combination with other assets of the Sellers or their Affiliates
or otherwise) (each a "Competing Bid"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Credit
Bid shall under no circumstances constitute a Competing Bid so long as the
Credit Bid is not supplemented with cash prior to, or at, an Auction. From the
date hereof (and any prior time) and until the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated, the Sellers are permitted to, and to cause their
Representatives and Affiliates to, initiate contact with, solicit or encourage
submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers by, any Person (in addition
to the Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives) in connection with a
Competing Bid, including, to (and to cause their Representatives and
Affiliates to) respond to any inquiries or offers to purchase all or any part
of the Acquired Assets and perform any and all other acts related thereto
which are required under the Bankruptcy Code, the Bidding Procedures Order or
other applicable Law (including supplying information relating to the Business
and the assets of the Sellers to prospective purchasers).

(c) Bankruptcy Court Filings.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement and the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases, the Sellers shall file
the Bidding Procedures Motion. The Buyer agrees that it will promptly take
such actions as are reasonably requested by the Sellers to assist in obtaining
entry of the Bidding Procedures Order. In the event the entry of the Bidding
Procedures Order shall be appealed, the Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to defend such appeal and Buyer agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Sellers in respect thereof.

(ii) Provided the Buyer is selected as the winning bidder in respect of the
Acquired Assets at the auction, if any, undertaken in accordance with the
Bidding Procedures Order (the "Auction"), or if no Competing Bid is submitted
with respect to the Acquired Assets that constitutes a Qualified Bid (as
defined in the Bidding Procedures Order) other than the Credit Bid, the
Sellers shall seek entry of the Confirmation Order and any other necessary
orders to close the sale of the Acquired Assets (the "Related Orders") by the
Bankruptcy Court in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Bidding
Procedures Order. The Buyer and the Sellers understand and agree that the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is subject to
approval by the Bankruptcy Court. Provided the Buyer is selected as the
winning bidder in respect of the Acquired Assets at the Auction, if any, or if
no Competing Bid is submitted with respect to



the Acquired Assets that constitutes a Qualified Bid (as defined in the
Bidding Procedures Order) other than the Credit Bid, the Buyer agrees that it
will promptly take such actions as are reasonably requested by the Sellers to
assist in obtaining entry of the Confirmation Order and any Related Orders
including a finding of adequate assurance of future performance by the Buyer,
including by furnishing affidavits or other documents or information for
filing with the Bankruptcy Court for the purposes, among others, of providing
necessary assurances of performance by the Buyer under this Agreement;
provided, however, that the obligations set forth in this sentence shall not
expand the Buyer's obligations set forth in Section 5.05 with respect to the
matters provided therein. Provided the Sellers are not in material breach of
this Agreement the Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Sellers, file, join in, or otherwise support in any manner whatsoever any
motion or other pleading relating to the sale of the Acquired Assets hereunder
(other than the sale contemplated by this Agreement). In the event the entry
of the Confirmation Order shall be appealed, the Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to defend such appeal and Buyer agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Sellers in respect thereof.

(iii) Provided the Buyer is selected as the winning bidder at the Auction, if
any, or if no Competing Bid is submitted with respect to the Acquired Assets,
the Sellers shall file such motions or pleadings as may be appropriate or
necessary to assume and assign the Transferred Contracts and to determine the
amount of the Cure Costs ("Assume / Assign Motions"); provided, that nothing
herein shall preclude the Sellers from filing such motions, including upon
commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases, to reject any Contracts that are not
Transferred Contracts ("Rejection Motions" and, with the Assume / Assign
Motions, the "Contract Motions"); provided, further, that any such Contract
Motions (including any list of Contracts or Leases to which such motion
pertains) shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

(iv) Until the Successful Bidder (as defined in the Bidding Procedures) is
designated by the Company and following such designation, if the Buyer is the
Successful Bidder, until the Closing, as soon as reasonably practicable (but
in all events at least two (2) Business Days) prior to filing any of the
following materials (including any pleadings, notices and statements related
thereto) with the Bankruptcy Court, Sellers shall provide Buyer and its
Representatives with drafts of (1) any Contract Motions related to the
assumption and assignment of the Transferred Contracts contemplated by this
Agreement; (2) any "first day" motions and the "first day" declaration; (3)
the Disclosure Statement; (4) the documents set forth in clause (v) below; and
(5) the list of parties to receive notices in connection with any Claims bar
date motion and the Plan to the extent different than the creditor matrix
filed on the Bankruptcy Court's docket (subject to any redactions the Company
determines in its sole discretion are necessary to protect commercially
sensitive information or personally identifiable information); provided, that,
in no event will Sellers be under any obligation to disclose information that
is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege. The Sellers and the Buyer
shall take commercially reasonable efforts to consult and cooperate with the
other Party regarding (A) the materials set forth in clause (1) to (5) of this
subsection (other than with respect to information that is subject to
attorney-client or similar privilege), including Buyer\'s good faith comments
thereto, (B) if the Buyer is designated by the Company as the Successful
Bidder pursuant to the Bidding Procedures Order, seeking approval of this
Agreement by the Bankruptcy Court and the hearing to consider approval of this
Agreement.



(v) The Sellers and the Buyer agree that the following documents shall be in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Sellers and the Buyer (with
Buyer's consent in respect of such documents not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned):

(A) the Bidding Procedures, the Bidding Procedures Motion and the Bidding
Procedures Order;

(B) the Sale Provisions contained in the Plan and Confirmation Order; and

(C) the Plan Supplement (and any exhibits thereto), solely to the extent such
documents are necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(d) Back-up Bidder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
or the Bidding Procedures, Buyer shall have no obligation, under any
circumstances, to serve as Back-up Bidder (as defined in the Bidding
Procedures).

SECTION 5.07. Access to Information.

(a) Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Laws
and Orders, during the period from the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Parties through the earlier of the Closing and the date on
which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VII, (i) the
Company shall provide to the Buyer (A) within thirty (30) days following the
end of each calendar month during such period, copies of monthly consolidated
financial statements of the Sellers prepared in the ordinary course of
business, together with a cash flow statement that includes cash flows for
operating, investing and financing and relevant details, in each case in
accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, and (B) within four (4) months
following the end of a fiscal year (including fiscal year 2019), audited
consolidated financial statements of the Sellers prepared in the ordinary
course of business and in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, and (ii)
the Sellers shall permit the Buyer and its Representatives to have reasonable
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to
the offices, facilities, assets, properties, management-level employees and
books and records of the Sellers, and shall furnish, or cause to be furnished,
to the Buyer such financial and operating data and other information with
respect to such entities and their respective offices, facilities, assets,
properties, employees, businesses and operations, in each case, as the Buyer
shall from time to time reasonably request in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, that nothing herein shall obligate the Sellers
to produce any such information in connection with any Action commenced or
threatened by or on behalf of the Buyer against any Seller or any Seller
Related Party. All access and investigation pursuant to this Section 5.07
shall be coordinated through the Company's general counsel or the designee
thereof and shall be conducted at the Buyer's expense and in such a manner as
not to interfere with the normal operations of the Businesses. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein or otherwise, no Seller shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would reasonably be expected to (i) jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege, (ii) contravene any Law, (iii) result in the disclosure of
competitively sensitive information or (iv) relate to the Sellers' sale
process, including any information related to



proposals from other Persons relating to any other potential transaction with
the Sellers, provided that in each of clauses (i) - (iv) that the Company
shall provide notice to the Buyer that information is being so withheld in a
manner that does not result in the disclosure of the underlying information
and the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into
reasonable and customary arrangements that would permit such access to be
provided or information to be disclosed without jeopardizing such privilege,
contravening such Law or resulting in the disclosure of such competitively
sensitive information, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein or otherwise, prior to the Closing, (i) without the prior
written consent of the Sellers (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), the Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
and its Representatives not to, contact any vendor, customer, partner or other
Person with whom the Sellers have a business relationship regarding the
business, operations, assets, financial condition or prospects of the Sellers
or this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) the Buyer
shall have no right to perform invasive or subsurface investigations of the
properties or facilities of the Sellers without the prior written consent of
the Sellers; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent Buyer or any of its Affiliates (or their
Representatives) from communicating with any Person in the ordinary course of
business unrelated to the transactions contemplated herein or from taking
actions or fulfilling obligations in connection with Section 5.05.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no access or
information provided by or on behalf of the Sellers pursuant to this Section
5.07 will modify any of the representations or warranties of the Sellers
contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the obligations of
the Buyer.

(b) The Parties agree that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect until the Closing. The Buyer shall hold, and
shall cause its Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
to hold, any Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) in confidence in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, which terms shall apply to the Buyer as if it were a party thereto.

SECTION 5.08. Public Statements. Except for the initial press release as is
mutually agreed to by Buyer and the Company that may be issued on the date
hereof (or such other time as mutually agreed by the Parties), no press
release or other public announcement regarding the terms and conditions of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be issued, made or permitted
to be issued or made by Buyer, any Seller or their Representatives without the
prior written consent of the Buyer (in the case of a Seller issuing such press
release) or the Company (in the case of Buyer issuing such press release prior
to the Closing) or Wind Down Co. (in the case of Buyer issuing such press
release following the Closing) unless such disclosure (a) is otherwise
required by applicable Law, the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange or by order of the Bankruptcy Court with respect to
filings to be made with the Bankruptcy Court in connection with this
Agreement; provided that, in the context of disclosures required by applicable
Law or by order of the Bankruptcy Court, the Party intending to make such
release shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such
applicable Law or Bankruptcy Court requirement to consult with the Buyer or
the Company, as applicable, with respect to the text thereof or (b) contains
only information that was already otherwise disclosed in a prior press release
or public announcement or is otherwise publicly available, other than as a
result of a breach by the disclosing party of this Section 5.08 or the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that Sellers shall file
this



Agreement with the Bankruptcy Court in connection with obtaining a
Confirmation Order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the existing direct and
indirect equityholders of the Sellers that are financial sponsors may disclose
publicly available information regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement solely to investors and potential investors (but not the public or
any other third party) that are subject to customary confidentiality
obligations in connection with normal fundraising and reporting activities in
the ordinary course.

SECTION 5.09. Tax Matters.

(a) Sellers (other than the Company) and Wind Down Co. will be responsible for
and pay all documentary, stamp, transfer (including real property transfer),
motor vehicle registration, sales, use, value added, excise and other similar
non-income Taxes and all filing and recording fees (and any interest,
penalties and additions with respect to such Taxes and fees) arising from or
relating to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), regardless of the Party on whom
liability is imposed under the provisions of applicable Tax Laws relating to
such Transfer Taxes. The Parties will consult and cooperate on a reasonable
basis in preparing and timely filing all Tax Returns with respect to any
Transfer Taxes and obtaining any available exemptions from or reductions in
such Transfer Taxes. To the extent the Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer
(including, after the Closing, Reorganized RentPath) is required by applicable
Tax Laws to pay any Transfer Taxes to a Governmental Authority, Sellers (other
than the Company) and Wind Down Co. will remit an amount equal to such
Transfer Taxes to the Buyer not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
due date for such payment. Buyer shall be entitled to an amount from the
Holdback Funds equal to any Transfer Taxes to the extent not paid by Sellers
(other than the Company) or Wind Down Co.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, including for
purposes of the definition of Excluded Taxes), Taxes for any Tax period that
begins on or before, and ends after, the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period")
shall be apportioned between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date, on the one hand, and the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date, on the other hand, (i) in
the case of sales, valued added and other similar Taxes, withholding Taxes,
employment and payroll Taxes, and Taxes based on or measured by income,
receipts or profits, on an interim closing of the books basis as if the
Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date and (ii) in the case of Taxes (other
than Taxes described in clause (i)), on a per diem basis. For the avoidance of
doubt, the amount of any Property Taxes imposed on or with respect to the
Acquired Assets for a Straddle Period that is apportioned to the portion of
such Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date shall be an
amount equal to the total amount of such Taxes for the Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period.

(c) Sellers (other than the Company) and Wind Down Co. shall prepare and file,
or cause to be prepared and filed, any Tax Return of Reorganized RentPath for
any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date that is required to be
filed after the Closing Date, and Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, any Tax Return of Reorganized RentPath for any Straddle
Period that is required to be filed after the Closing Date. All such Tax
Returns shall



be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice except as otherwise
required by Law or this Agreement. The party that is responsible for the
preparation of any Tax Return pursuant to this Section 5.09(c) shall provide a
draft of such Tax Return to the non-preparing party at least 30 days prior to
the due date for such Tax Return (or, if not practicable, as soon as
reasonably practicable) for such non-preparing party's review and approval
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). Sellers (other
than the Company) and Wind Down Co. shall pay when due all Excluded Taxes
shown as due and owing on all such Tax Returns, provided that, to the extent
the Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer (including, after the Closing, Reorganized
RentPath) is required by applicable Tax Laws to pay any Excluded Taxes shown
as due and owing on any such Tax Return, Sellers (other than the Company) and
Wind Down Co. will remit an amount equal to such Excluded Taxes and the
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third-party expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation or review of any such Tax Return prepared at
the direction of the Buyer, to the Buyer not less than five (5) Business Days
prior to the due date for such payment. Buyer shall be entitled to an amount
from the Holdback Funds equal to any such Excluded Taxes and expenses to the
extent not paid by Sellers (other than the Company) or Wind Down Co. If, after
the Closing, Reorganized RentPath receives a refund for Excluded Taxes, then
Buyer will remit an amount equal to such refund (less any reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket third-party expenses, including Taxes, incurred by
Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer in obtaining or receiving such refund) to Wind
Down Co. within 10 days of the receipt of such refund (provided that Buyer
shall be entitled to retain all or any portion of any such refund to the
extent that Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer has paid any Excluded Taxes to a
Governmental Authority after the Closing Date or incurred any reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket third-party expenses in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return pursuant to this Section 5.09(c), but, in each
case, only to the extent that it has not been reimbursed or otherwise
compensated for such Taxes or expenses by Sellers (other than the Company),
Wind Down Co. or the Holdback Funds).

(d) After the Closing, Buyer shall control any audit, claim or other Tax
proceeding (a "Tax Claim") against Reorganized RentPath for any Tax period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date or any Straddle Period, provided that,
for so long as the remaining balance of the Holdback Funds is sufficient to
satisfy, or for so long as Wind Down Co. is otherwise expected to bear (and
has funds available to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction sufficient to pay for
any portion of such Taxes), any Liability for Excluded Taxes reasonably
expected to result from such Tax Claim, Buyer shall (i) keep Wind Down Co.
informed on a reasonable basis with respect to the status of any such Tax
Claim, (ii) to the extent permitted by Law, permit Wind Down Co., at Wind Down
Co.'s own cost and expense, to participate in any such Tax Claim, including
reviewing material submissions prior to filing and attending hearings and
(iii) not settle any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Wind
Down Co. (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed). At Buyer's option, any Excluded Taxes that become due and owing as a
result of any such Tax Claim and the reasonable documented out-of-pocket
third-party expenses incurred by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer in connection
with any such Tax Claim will be satisfied from the Holdback Funds, provided
that Sellers (other than the Company) and Wind Down Co. shall pay any such
Excluded Taxes that Wind Down Co. was expected to bear, provided that, in the
event that such Excluded Taxes exceed the then-remaining balance of Holdback
Funds, nothing herein shall limit the obligations of Wind Down Co. under the
Plan to satisfy any such Excluded Taxes.



(e) In connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns, or the
preparation for or defense against any audits, examinations or any other
proceedings relating to Taxes with respect to the Business or the Acquired
Assets, the Parties (including Wind Down Co. and Reorganized RentPath) will
cooperate on a reasonable basis with each other, including the furnishing or
making available during normal business hours of records, personnel (as
reasonably required and in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the conduct of the Business or any other businesses of the Buyer or the
Sellers), books of account, powers of attorney or other materials necessary or
helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns and the conduct of such
audits, examinations or other proceedings.

(f) No later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall
deliver to Buyer Seller's good faith estimate of any Excluded Taxes
constituting Taxes not yet due and payable (including Excluded Taxes that are
expected to become due and payable as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) for Buyer's review (such estimate, the "Pre-
Closing Tax Estimate"). The Pre-Closing Tax Estimate shall be eligible for
distribution by Wind Down Co. to creditors pursuant to the Plan after the
filing of any Tax Return to which such Taxes relate to the extent not used to
satisfy Wind Down Co.'s obligation to pay such Taxes pursuant to this Section
5.09.

SECTION 5.10. Transferred Employees.

(a) No later than twenty one (21) days after the date of this Agreement, the
Sellers shall provide to the Buyer, in the form of the census attached as
Exhibit 5.10(a) to the Schedules, an independent contractor roster and
employee census that, in each case, to the extent permitted under applicable
Law or pursuant to Employee consent, if such Employee consent is required
under applicable Law, includes the information set forth on Schedule 5.10(a)
for each Employee or independent contractor.

(b) No later than sixty (60) days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall
provide to the Buyer, in the form of the census attached as Exhibit 5.10(a) to
the Schedules, an updated independent contractor roster and an employee census
that in each case, to the extent permitted under applicable Law or pursuant to
Employee consent, if such Employee consent is required under applicable Law,
includes the information set forth on Schedule 5.10(a) as well as the
information set forth on Schedule 5.10(b) for each Employee or independent
contractor and whether such Employee is currently facing discipline by his or
her employer or is subject to a performance improvement plan with his or her
employer. At least seven (7) days prior to the Closing Date (or no later than
two (2) days following an Employee's hire date if such date is less than seven
(7) days prior to the Closing Date), the Buyer shall deliver, in writing, an
offer of employment to each Employee subject to such Employee's continued
employment immediately prior to the Closing to commence immediately following
the Closing Date. Each such offer of employment shall include (i) compensation
and employee benefits consistent with the requirements set forth in Section
5.11(a), and (ii) the same or a substantially comparable position within
Reorganized RentPath and a location in the same metropolitan area as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing, in each case, for each such Employee. Any
Employees who accept such offer by the Closing Date are hereinafter referred
to as the "Transferred Employees."



SECTION 5.11. Employee Benefits.

(a) The Buyer shall provide, or cause to be provided, for a period of one (1)
year following the Closing Date or such longer period of time required by
applicable Law, to each of the Transferred Employees while employed by the
Buyer, (i) compensation (which shall be limited to base salary, base wages and
opportunities for commissions and ordinary course annual bonuses, if
applicable) that is substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
compensation (which is limited to base salary, base wages and opportunities
for commissions and ordinary course annual bonuses, if applicable) as provided
to such Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, provided
that the bonuses for the fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs shall be
prorated based on the period of time in the fiscal year following the Closing
Date and (ii) employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are substantially
comparable to those benefits provided to similarly situated employees of the
Buyer, in each case excluding equity arrangements and excluding any retention,
sale, transaction or similar incentive.

(b) If the employment of a Transferred Employee listed on Schedule 5.11(b) is
terminated by Buyer without cause during the one (1) year period following the
Closing Date, such Transferred Employee shall receive, subject to the Buyer's
receipt of an effective release of claims, severance benefits equal to the
greater of (i) three (3) months' of such Transferred Employee's base salary as
in effect at the time of such termination and (ii) the severance benefit such
Transferred Employee would be entitled to under the Buyer Severance Policy in
effect generally for Buyer's employees. If the employment of a Transferred
Employee not listed on Schedule 5.11(b) is terminated by the Buyer without
cause during the one (1) year period following the Closing Date, such
Transferred Employee shall, subject to the Buyer's receipt of an effective
release of claims, be entitled to the severance benefit provided to the
Buyer's employees generally under the Buyer Severance Policy in effect
generally for the Buyer's employees.

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and determining vacation accrual (but
not for benefit accrual or determining the level or amount of benefits under
any employee benefit plans) under the employee benefit plans of the Buyer
providing benefits to Transferred Employees (the "Buyer Plans"), the Buyer
shall credit each Transferred Employee with his or her years of service with
the Sellers and any predecessor entities, to the same extent as such
Transferred Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit
for such service under any similar Employee Benefit Plan. Buyer shall and
shall cause its Affiliates to waive any actively-at-work requirements,
limitations on benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions and exclusions
and waiting periods for any Transferred Employees and their eligible spouses
and dependents. Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates to credit such
Transferred Employees for purposes of any deductibles, out-of-pocket limits,
co-pays and co-insurance under any Buyer Plan for amounts paid in the year of
initial participation in the Buyer Plans by Transferred Employees and their
respective spouses and dependents under the health plans of the Sellers in
such year.

(d) Except for communications following the execution of this Agreement and in
connection with such execution or in connection with milestones related to the
Bankruptcy Cases, in each case, following notice to the Company's office of
the general counsel and during normal business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice, from the date hereof until the earlier of the



Closing and the termination of this Agreement, the Buyer shall not, and shall
cause its Representatives not to, contact any employee of the Sellers in
connection with or pertaining to any subject matter of this Agreement without
the Sellers' prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers agree that the Sellers shall be
solely responsible for satisfying the continuation coverage requirements of
Section 4980B of the Code for all individuals who are "MandA qualified
beneficiaries" as such term is defined in Section 54.4980B-9 of the Treasury
Regulations.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.11 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall be construed to prevent the termination of employment of any individual
Transferred Employee.

(g) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, the Buyer shall credit
Transferred Employees for their accrued and unused vacation, sick days and
personal days through the Closing Date to the extent such vacation, sick and
personal days are not paid to such Transferred Employees, and the Transferred
Employees will be entitled to use such vacation, sick and personal days in
accordance with terms substantially similar to the terms of Sellers' vacation
policy through December 31st of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs.
Beginning on January 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs, Transferred Employees will be covered by Buyer's
vacation policies generally applicable to other similarly situated employees
of Buyer.

(h) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer will grant the opportunity to earn
retention bonuses (the "Retention Bonuses") to certain Transferred Employees,
with terms and conditions as specified on Schedule 5.11(h).

(i) Nothing in this Section 5.11 or otherwise in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall (i) create any third-party beneficiary or other
rights in any union, employee or former employee of the Sellers or any of
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof), any other participant in any Employee Benefit Plan or any other
Person; (ii) create any rights to continued employment with the Sellers, the
Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or in any way
limit the ability of the Sellers, the Buyer or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to terminate the employment of any individual at
any time and for any reason; or (iii) constitute or be deemed to constitute an
amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement sponsored or maintained by the
Sellers, the Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

SECTION 5.12. Change in Name. As promptly as practicable after Closing (and in
no event more than thirty (30) days after the Closing), the Sellers shall
cause RentPath Gives Back Foundation, Inc. to make any and all filings
necessary to change its name and the names of any of its Subsidiaries to a
name that does not include the words "RentPath" or any variation thereof.

SECTION 5.13. Parent Guaranty. Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to the Sellers and their respective successors and assigns the full
and timely performance of the Buyer's obligations pursuant to this Agreement
and the Related Agreements, in each case as



the same is now or may hereafter be in effect. Parent acknowledges and agrees
that this guaranty is full, absolute and unconditional and is a guaranty of
performance and payment and is in no way conditioned or contingent upon any
attempt to collect from, enforce performance or compliance by, or otherwise
seek remedies from, Buyer.

SECTION 5.14. The Stock Transaction; Reorganization. Following the date
hereof, Sellers shall execute the steps specified in Exhibit E. Sellers shall
deliver drafts of agreements, instruments, certificates and other documents
reasonably necessary to effect the steps described in Exhibit E to the Buyer
for the Buyer's review, comment and approval, keep the Buyer reasonably
informed with respect to all material activity concerning the status of the
steps described in Exhibit E, and cooperate in good faith with all of the
Buyer's reasonable requests for information related to each such step. The
Plan shall provide that Wind Down Co. will perform any and all obligations of
Wind Down Co. set forth herein.

made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent expressly made as of
an earlier date, in which case as of such date). The representations and

ARTICLE VII 

SURVIVAL; TERMINATION

SECTION 7.01. Survival. The Parties, intending to modify any applicable
statute of limitations, agree that (a) except in connection with Fraud, (i)
the representations and warranties in this Agreement and in any certificate
delivered pursuant hereto and (ii) the covenants and agreements in this
Agreement to the extent such covenants and agreements only require performance
prior to the Closing shall, in each case, terminate effective as of the
Closing and shall not survive the Closing for any purpose, and thereafter
there shall be no liability on the part of, nor shall any claim be made by,
any party in respect thereof and (b) to the extent the covenants and
agreements in this Agreement contemplate performance after the Closing or
expressly by their terms survive the Closing, such covenants and agreements
shall survive the Closing in accordance with their respective terms only to
the extent and for such period as shall be required for the party required to
perform under such covenant and agreement to complete the performance required
thereby.

SECTION 7.02. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Sellers and the Buyer;

(b) by the Sellers or the Buyer at any time after 11:59 p.m. Eastern time six
(6) months from the date hereof (the "Outside Date"), if the Closing shall not
have occurred on or prior to such time; provided, however, that neither the
Sellers nor the Buyer shall have the right to terminate



this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.02(b) if the Sellers' or the Buyer's
failure to perform any covenants or agreements of the Sellers or the Buyer set
forth in this Agreement has resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur
prior to the Outside Date, respectively; provided, further, however, that if,
as of the date ten (10) Business Days prior to the Outside Date, all of the
closing conditions set forth in Article VI have been satisfied or waived
(other than (x) the closing condition set forth in Section 6.01(a) (which is
not satisfied as a result of a Restraint related to any Antitrust Law) and/or
Section 6.01(b) and (y) those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing), then the Outside Date may be extended for (A) one
(1) additional three (3)-month period following the Outside Date at the option
of the Buyer (such three-month anniversary, the "Initial Extension Period")
and (B) one (1) additional three (3)-month period following the Initial
Extension Period at the option of the Buyer but subject to Seller's written
consent (which consent is not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), for a total of six (6) months, with all references in this Agreement
to the Outside Date thereafter being deemed to be references to the Outside
Date as so extended; provided, however, that if the Outside Date is extended
pursuant to this Section 7.02(b), the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds (x) an amount
equal to $3,750,000 promptly following the exercise of each such extension and
(y) if Closing has not occurred or this Agreement has not terminated in
accordance with Article VII, an amount equal to $3,750,000 on the date that is
forty five (45) days following the commencement of each such extension (or on
the first Business Day thereafter if such date is not a Business Day) (such
amounts, the "Extension Funding"); provided, further, in the event that a
request for additional information or documents or a comparable request in the
form of compulsory process from a Governmental Authority including a subpoena
duces tecum and/or Civil Investigative Demand (all of which will be referred
to herein as a "Second Request") is issued by any Governmental Authority, and
the Buyer has not substantially complied with that request by the date that is
six (6) months from the date of issuance of the Second Request, it shall not
be unreasonable for Sellers to withhold their consent to the Buyer's exercise
of its option under this Section 7.02(b) to extend the Outside Date an
additional three (3) months beyond the Initial Extension Period.

(c) by the Sellers or the Buyer, upon written notice to the other Party, if
any Restraint permanently prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall have become final and non‑appealable;

(d) by the Buyer, if any representation or warranty of the Sellers set forth
in Article III shall be or shall have become inaccurate or the Sellers shall
have breached or failed to perform any of their covenants or other agreements
set forth in this Agreement, which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform
would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section
6.02(a) or Section 6.02(b), and which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform
cannot be cured by the Sellers or, if capable of being cured, shall not have
been cured prior to the earlier of (i) the Outside Date and (ii) the date that
is thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the Sellers of notice in writing
from the Buyer specifying the nature of such inaccuracy, breach or failure to
perform and requesting that it be cured; provided, however, that the Buyer
shall provide such notice to the Sellers within three (3) Business Days after
becoming aware of any such inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform that would
be reasonably likely to give rise to the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.02(a) or Section 6.02(b); provided, further, that the Buyer
shall not have the



right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.02(d) if the
Buyer is then in material breach of this Agreement;

(e) by the Sellers, if any representation or warranty of the Buyer set forth
in Article IV shall be or shall have become inaccurate or the Buyer shall have
breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform would
give rise to the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.03(a)
or Section 6.03(b), and which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform cannot
be cured by the Buyer, as the case may be, or, if capable of being cured,
shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (i) the Business Day prior
to the Outside Date and (ii) the date that is thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt by the Buyer of notice in writing from the Sellers specifying the
nature of such inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform and requesting that it
be cured; provided, however, that the Sellers shall provide such notice to the
Buyer within three (3) Business Days after becoming aware of any such
inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform that would be reasonably likely to
give rise to the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.03(a)
or Section 6.03(b); provided, further, that the Sellers shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.02(e) if they are
then in material breach of this Agreement; or

(f) automatically upon consummation of a Competing Bid;

(g) by the Sellers or the Buyer if Sellers designate an entity other than the

Bankruptcy Code lifting the automatic stay with respect to any material
Acquired Asset;

(iv) (1) following entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Bidding Procedures
Order, such order is (A) amended, modified or supplemented in a manner
materially adverse to the Buyer without Buyer's prior written consent (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or (B) voided, reversed or

to the Buyer in accordance with Section 5.06(c)(v) (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any of clause (b),
(c), (d), (e), (g), (h), (i) or (j) of this Section 7.02 shall give written
notice of such termination to the other party in accordance with Section 8.01
specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such
termination is effected.

SECTION 7.03. Effect of Termination; Etc. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.02, (a) this Agreement shall

Section 5.08, Article VIII, the obligations in respect of the Termination
Payment set forth in Section 5.06(a), the obligations in respect of the Escrow
Funds set forth in Section 2.04, and the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive termination of this Agreement and remain valid and binding obligations
of each of the parties, and (b) subject to the terms and conditions of the
surviving provisions of this Agreement, there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of the Buyer or the Sellers. Notwithstanding anything
in the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 7.03 to the contrary,
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.02 shall not release any
party hereto from any liability (i) pursuant to the sections specified in this
Section 7.03 that survive such termination, including Section 7.04, (ii) for
an Intentional Breach of this Agreement or (iii) Fraud.



SECTION 7.04. Break-Up Fee.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Buyer or the

of a Restraint related to any Antitrust Law or (B) the condition set forth in
Section 6.01(b) is not then satisfied or (ii) by the Buyer or the Sellers
pursuant to Section 7.02(c) in connection with a Restraint related to any

Section 2.04(b)(ii) (it being understood that in no event shall the Buyer be
required to pay the Break-Up Fee on more than one occasion). In the event that
the Sellers receive full payment of the Break-Up Fee pursuant to Sections
7.04(a)(i) or (ii) under circumstances where the Break-Up Fee is payable, the
receipt of the Break-Up Fee and such expenses shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) for any
and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Sellers or any Seller
Related Party against the Buyer or any Buyer Related Party in connection with
this Agreement (and the actual or purported termination hereof) and the
transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof), or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, other than with respect to any
Intentional Breach; provided, that nothing in this Section 7.04(a) shall limit
the obligations of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates under the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that without these agreements, the other Parties would not
enter into this Agreement. All payments under this Section 7.04 shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by the Sellers.

SECTION 8.02. Amendment/Waiver, Etc. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended, modified, supplemented or waived if, and only if, such amendment,
modification, supplement or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, modification or supplement, by the Buyer and the Sellers, or in the
case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.



SECTION 8.03. Assignment. No Party may assign any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties,
and any attempt to assign this Agreement without such consent shall be void
and of no effect, provided that the Buyer may assign any or all of its rights
under this Agreement to an Affiliate without the prior written consent of the
Sellers; provided, that any such assignment shall not affect Buyer's
obligations hereunder.

SECTION 8.04. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including all Schedules and
Exhibits hereto), together with the Escrow Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement, contains the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
oral or written, with respect to such matters. In the event of any conflict
between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Confirmation Order or
the Plan, as the case may be, the terms of the Confirmation Order or the Plan,
as the case may be, shall govern.

SECTION 8.05. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

SECTION 8.06. Fulfillment of Obligations. Any obligation of any party under
this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an
Affiliate of such party, shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or
fulfilled by such party.

SECTION 8.07. Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, other than, following the
Closing, the provisions of (a) Section 2.10, to the extent applicable to the
Buyer Related Parties, which Buyer Related Parties shall be express
third‑party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on and enforce,
such section and (b) Section 8.15, to the extent applicable to Seller Related
Parties and Buyer Related Parties, which Seller Related Parties and Buyer
Related Parties shall be express third‑party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to rely on and enforce, such respective sections, express or implied,
is intended to confer upon any Person other than the Buyer, the Sellers or
their respective successors or permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under
or by reason of this Agreement, except for the right of the Sellers, on behalf
of the holders of equity interests in the Sellers, to pursue damages and other
relief (including damages based on the loss of the economic benefits of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the loss of premium offered to
such holders and taking into consideration all relevant matters, including
other combination opportunities and the time value of money) and equitable
relief, which damages and other relief shall also be available to such
holders) in the event of any breach of this Agreement by the Buyer, which
right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by the Buyer and which right may,



for the avoidance of doubt, only be enforced prior to the Closing by the
Sellers on behalf of such holders.

SECTION 8.08. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the Party incurring
such expenses.

SECTION 8.09. Governing Law/Jurisdiction/Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement and any controversy, dispute or claim arising hereunder or
related hereto (whether by contract, tort or otherwise) shall be governed by
and construed and enforced in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State
of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision
or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware.

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER AGREEMENTS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(II) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) SUCH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.09.

(c) The Parties to this Agreement submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Bankruptcy Courts in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement, and any controversy, dispute or claim arising
hereunder or related hereto (whether by contract, tort or otherwise), and any
related agreement, certificate or other document delivered in connection
herewith and by this Agreement waive, and agree not to assert, any defense in
any action for the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement, and any
controversy, dispute or claim arising hereunder or related hereto (whether by
contract, tort or otherwise), and any related agreement, certificate or other
document delivered in connection herewith that they are not subject to such
jurisdiction or that such action may not be brought or is not maintainable in
such courts or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts,
that the action is brought in an inconvenient forum, or that the venue of the
action is improper; provided, however, that (x) if the Bankruptcy Cases have
not been commenced or (y) upon the closing of the Bankruptcy Cases and the
Bankruptcy Court declines to accept jurisdiction upon a motion to reopen the
Bankruptcy Cases, the Parties agree to unconditionally and irrevocably submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
(or in the event (but only in the event) that such court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction over such Proceeding in the United States District Court
for the District of



Delaware) and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
and any appellate court from any thereof, for the resolution of any such
Proceeding. The Parties intend that all foreign jurisdictions will enforce any
decree of the Bankruptcy Court in any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any Related Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

SECTION 8.10. Counterparts, Etc. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which
shall constitute one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered
to the other party. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to
this Agreement by email in "portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by
other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of
the paper document bearing the original signature.

SECTION 8.11. Headings, Etc. The provision of the Table of Contents, the
division of this Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and
the insertion of headings are for convenience of reading only and shall not
affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All
references in this Agreement to any Article, Section, subsection or clause are
to the corresponding Article, Section, subsection or clause of this Agreement,
unless otherwise specified.

SECTION 8.12. Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, from time to time, at the request of any party hereto and, except
as otherwise set forth herein, at the expense of the Party so requesting, each
other party shall execute and deliver to such requesting party such documents
and take such other action as such requesting party may reasonably request in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 8.13. Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by the Parties in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Buyer, on the one hand,
and the Sellers on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable)
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and to
thereafter cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions thereto set forth in
this Agreement. The foregoing rights are in addition to and without limitation
of any other remedy to which the Parties may be entitled at law or in equity.
The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.
In respect of any such action for specific performance, each of the Parties
hereby waives (a) any defenses in any action for specific performance,
including the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any
requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite
to obtaining equitable relief. If any party brings any action to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the amount of
time during which such action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or
(y) such other later date established by the Delaware court presiding over
such action. The Parties further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this



Section 8.13, no Party shall in any respect waive its right to seek at any
time any other form of relief that may be available to it under this Agreement
or any other agreement or document entered into in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including monetary damages) in the event
that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies
provided for in this Section 8.13 are not available or otherwise are not
granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 8.13 shall require any
party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party's right to
institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 8.13
prior to or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article
VII, nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this
Section 8.13 or anything set forth in this Section 8.13 restrict or limit any
party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
Article VII or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement or any other
agreement or document entered into in connection herewith or the transactions
contemplated hereby that may be available then or thereafter.

SECTION 8.14. Limitation on Liability. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, but subject to Section 2.10, (a) except in the case
of Fraud or Intentional Breach, the maximum aggregate Liability of the Sellers
under this Agreement shall not exceed an amount equal to $58,750,000 and (b)
in no event shall any Party have any liability for punitive damages, except to
the extent payable to a third party.

SECTION 8.15. Non‑Recourse. All claims or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of
or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), may be made only against the Persons that are expressly identified
as Parties. No Person who is not a named Party, including any past, present or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, direct or
indirect equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, banker or other consultant
or Representative of any named Party ("Related Parties"), shall have any
liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon
any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its
owners or affiliates) for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in
connection with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation or execution;
and each party hereto waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and
obligations against any such Related Party.

SECTION 8.16. Release. The Confirmation Order shall contain (a) mutual
releases from the Seller and their Affiliates and the Buyer and its
Affiliates, to the fullest extent permitted by law, from all claims relating
to, among other things, the negotiation, execution, and implementation of this
Agreement and (b) customary release, exculpation and injunction provisions,
and such provisions shall apply to the Buyer and Buyer's Representatives to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law.

SECTION 8.17. Interpretation. The words "hereof", "herein", "hereto",
"hereunder" and "hereinafter" and words of similar import, when used in this
Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires. The terms

plural, and vice versa. The term "dollars" and character "$" shall mean United
States dollars.

obtained from or provided by or to the Sellers, shall be satisfied by

consent or waiver from or to, the Company. The term "ordinary course of
business" shall mean the ordinary course of business consistent with the

neuter. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting
of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by
the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. Any agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation defined or
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument, statute, rule or
regulation as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including
(in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver of consent and (in the
case of statutes, rules or regulations) by succession or comparable successor
statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein; provided, that for purposes of any representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of a specific date or
dates, references to any statute, rule or regulation shall be deemed to refer
to such statute, rule or regulation, as amended (and, in the case of statutes,
any rules and regulations promulgated under such statutes), in each case, as
of such date. Any agreement referred to herein shall include reference to all
exhibits, schedules and other documents or agreements attached thereto. The
Parties agree that any drafts of this Agreement or any Related Agreements

defense or otherwise take any position inconsistent with the foregoing in
connection with any dispute or proceeding among any of the foregoing or for
any other purpose.
