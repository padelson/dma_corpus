and shall cause the Group Companies to use their, respective commercially

party (other than with respect to any Regulatory Approvals, which shall be

Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Seller shall not, and
Seller shall cause the Group Companies not to, take any action to directly or
indirectly initiate, solicit or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
knowingly provide any information to, any Person (other than Buyer and
the Buyers Representatives) concerning any purchase of any of the Shares or
any merger, sale of substantially all of the assets of the Group Companies or
similar transactions involving the Group Companies (each such transaction,

of this Agreement and the Closing Date, if after the date hereof any Seller
Group Member becomes aware of any fact or condition that constitutes a breach
of any representation or warranty made by a Seller Group Member in _Article
III_ or of any covenant that would cause the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)_, as applicable, not to be
satisfied as of the Closing Date, such Seller Group Member will disclose in
writing to Buyer such breach. 

5.06 _Regulation S-X_. Prior to Closing, the Seller Group Members shall
promptly provide, and shall cause the Group Companies to promptly provide,
updated financial statements of the Group Companies that are necessary or
advisable, in the reasonable opinion of Buyer, to enable Buyer to prepare

approval (in a form and manner satisfactory to Buyer), by the number of
stockholders as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code,
all payments and benefits that may separately or in the aggregate constitute
"parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code ("
_Parachute Payments_ "), which determination shall be made by the Company and
shall be subject to the review and reasonable approval by Buyer, so that such
payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be Parachute Payments. Prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Company to deliver to Buyer evidence
satisfactory to Buyer that (i) a stockholder vote was solicited in
conformance with Section 280G of the Code, and the requisite stockholder
approval was obtained with respect to any payments or benefits that were
subject to the stockholder vote (the " _280G Approval_ "), or (ii) the 280G
Approval was not obtained, and as a consequence, because each Person who
otherwise might receive any payments or benefits in connection with the
Transactions that constitute Parachute Payments entered into a waiver of each
such Persons right to receive or retain any Parachute Payments, each in a
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, such Parachute Payments
shall not be made or retained.

 

5.09 _Polish Certificates_. Seller shall use its, and shall cause the Group
Companies to use their, respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
and provide the Polish Certificates to Buyer prior to the Closing; _provided_
if such certificates are not provided prior to Closing, Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and provide the Polish Certificates
to Buyer promptly following the Closing. For the avoidance of doubts, the
obligation to obtain and provide to Buyer the Polish Certificates does not
constitute a condition to Closing.

such material may be limited to the other Partys external counsel. The
Parties shall not agree to an extension of any waiting period or review being

(including any applicable increases in premiums or deductibles in respect of
any third party insurance).

9.05 _Claim Procedures_.

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. In order for a Buyer Indemnitee to be entitled to
any indemnification provided for under  _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ in respect of,
arising out of or involving a claim made by any Person not a party hereto
against the Buyer Indemnitee (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Buyer
Indemnitee must notify Seller in writing of such Third Party Claim (setting
forth in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such Third Party Claim (to
the extent known by the Buyer Indemnitee) and the amount or estimated amount
(to the extent reasonably estimable) of Damages arising out of, involving or
otherwise in respect of such Third Party Claim) within ten (10) Business Days
after receipt by such Buyer Indemnitee of written notice of such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall
not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent that
the Seller Group Members shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as
a result of such failure.

 

(b) _Assumption_. If a Third Party Claim is made against a Buyer Indemnitee,
Seller shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and (unless
(i) a Seller Group Member is also a party to such Third Party Claim and the
Buyer Indemnitee determines in good faith that joint representation would be
inappropriate or (ii) Seller fails to provide reasonable assurance to the
Buyer Indemnitee of its willingness and financial capacity to defend such
Third Party Claim and provide indemnification with respect to such Third Party
Claim), if Seller so choose, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
selected by Seller, which counsel must be reasonably satisfactory to the
Buyer Indemnitee, by giving written notice thereof to Buyer within twenty (20)
Business Days after Buyer gives notice to Seller of such Third Party Claim. If
Seller assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 9.05(b)_, (i) the Seller Group Members shall not be liable to
the Buyer Indemnitee for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Buyer
Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof and (ii) it shall be
conclusively established for purposes hereof that such Third Party Claim is
within the scope of and subject to indemnification

 



67

    

 hereunder. Any such participation or assumption shall not constitute a
waiver by any party of any attorney-client privilege in connection with such
Third Party Claim. If Seller assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.05(b)_, the Buyer Indemnitee shall have
the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by Seller, it being
understood that Seller shall control such defense; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Seller Group Members shall pay the fees and expenses of separate
counsel if the Buyer Indemnitee and the Seller Group Members shall have been
advised by their respective counsel that (A) there may be defenses available
to the Buyer Indemnitee that are different to or additional to those available
to the Seller Group Members or (B) there is a conflict of interest that could
make it inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct to
have common counsel. The Seller Group Members shall be liable for the fees and
expenses of counsel employed by the Buyer Indemnitee for any period during
which Seller has not assumed the defense thereof. If Seller chooses to defend
or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the Buyer Indemnitees shall cooperate in
the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon Sellers request) the provision to Seller of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making
employees available at such times and places as may be reasonably necessary to
defend against such Third Party Claim for the purpose of providing additional
information, explanation or testimony in connection with such Third Party
Claim. If notice is given to Seller of a Third Party Claim in accordance with
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.05(b)_ and Seller does not, within twenty (20)
Business Days after such notice is given, give notice to the Buyer Indemnitee
of its election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Seller
Group Members will be bound by any determination made in such Third Party
Claim or any settlement, compromise or discharge effected by the Buyer
Indemnitee. If Seller assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, Seller shall
defend such Third Party Claim diligently and in good faith to final
conclusion or settlement of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller shall not settle such Third Party Claim without the consent of the
Buyer Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, unless such settlement (i) does not involve any
finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of
any Person and would not have any adverse effect on any other claims that may
be made against the Buyer Indemnitee, (ii) does not involve any relief other
than monetary damages that are paid in full by Seller and (iii) completely,
finally and unconditionally releases the Buyer Indemnitee in connection
with such Third Party Claim and would not otherwise adversely affect the
Buyer Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be entitled
to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (and shall be liable for the
fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the Buyer Indemnitee in defending
such Third Party Claim) if (i) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief or relief other than monetary damages for which the
Buyer Indemnitee would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or
may otherwise adversely affect the Buyer Indemnitee, (ii) the Third Party
Claim is a criminal or administrative proceeding, or relates to such a
proceeding, or the underlying facts or circumstances of which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to such a proceeding, (iii) the Third
Party Claim involves a material commercial partner of a Group Company or (iv)
the indemnification obligation of the applicable Seller Group
Member(s) (after the application, if applicable, of any applicable cap) is
determined in good faith by Buyer to be less than 50% of the potential maximum
Damages amount of the Third Party Claim at issue.

 



68

    

(c) _Privilege_. If Seller chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, Seller
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Buyer Indemnitee (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) cause, or
agree to, the waiver of the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product
immunity or any other privilege or protection in respect of confidential
legal memoranda and other privileged materials drafted by, or otherwise
reflecting the legal advice of, internal or outside counsel of a Buyer
Indemnitee (the " _Subject Materials_ ") relating to such Third Party Claim.
Each party hereto mutually acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates, that (i) each shares a common legal interest in preparing for
the defense of legal proceedings, or potential legal proceedings, arising out
of, relating to or in respect of any actual or threatened Third Party Claim or
any related claim or counterclaim, (ii) the sharing of Subject Materials will
further such common legal interest and (iii) by disclosing any Subject
Materials to and/or sharing any Subject Materials with Seller, the Buyer
Indemnitee shall not waive the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-
product immunity or any other privilege or protection. The Buyer Indemnitee
shall not be required to make available to Seller any information that is
subject to an attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege that based
on the advice of outside counsel would be impaired by such disclosure or any
confidentiality restriction under applicable Law.

(d) _Other Claims_. In the event any Buyer Indemnitee or any Seller Indemnitee
has a claim against the Seller Group Member(s) or Buyer, respectively, under
_Section_ __ _ 9.02_ (as applicable, the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, the Buyer Indemnitee or the Seller
Indemnitee, as applicable, shall deliver notice of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party (setting forth in reasonable detail the facts giving rise
to such claim (to the extent known) and the amount or estimated amount (to the
extent reasonably estimable) of Damages arising out of, involving or
otherwise in respect of such claim) with reasonable promptness after becoming
aware of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. If the Indemnifying Party does not
notify the Buyer Indemnitee or the Seller Indemnitee, as applicable, within
twenty (20) Business Days following the Indemnifying Partys receipt of such
notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Buyer
Indemnitee or the Seller Indemnitee, as applicable, under _Section_ __ _
9.02_, such claim specified by the Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as
applicable, in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such
liability to the Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as applicable, on
demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any
portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such
claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined.

(e) _Coordination with Tax Contests_. If there shall be any conflicts between
the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.05_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)_
(relating to Tax contests), the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)_ shall
control with respect to Tax contests.

 

9.06 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Claims_. Buyer and the Seller Group
Members agree to report each indemnification payment made in respect of
Damages as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal income Tax purposes
unless the indemnified party determines in good faith that such reporting
position is incorrect.

 



69

    

9.07 _Exclusive Remedy_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that,
except as otherwise specifically provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.01_ (Tax
Matters), _Section_ __ _ 12.18_ (Specific Performance), with respect to the
Earnout Certificate or Employment Agreements, and claims of, or causes
of action arising out of, fraud, (a) from and after the Closing, its sole and
exclusive remedy (and the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnitees
and the Seller Indemnitees) with respect to any and all rights, claims,
proceedings and causes of action it may have against any other party
(including any Affiliate of Buyer or Seller) resulting from or relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement and the Transactions, whether arising under
or based upon any Law or otherwise (including any right, whether arising at
law or in equity, to seek indemnification, contribution, cost recovery,
damages (including Damages), or any other recourse or remedy, including as may
arise under common law) (each, a " _Transaction Matter_ "), shall be pursuant
to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article IX_ , and (b)
from and after the Closing, in furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto
(each on its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnitees, in the case
of Buyer, and the Seller Indemnitees, in the case of the Seller Group Members)
hereby (i) covenants and agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly,
assert or otherwise bring, commence or institute, or cause to be brought,
commenced or instituted, any Transaction Matter, other than a contract action
to recover Damages pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this _Article IX_ , and (ii) waives, from and after the Closing, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all Transaction
Matters other than a contract action to recover Damages pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article IX_.

70

    

 be satisfied by the Outside Date and the breach or breaches causing such

__ _ 10.01(d)_ will not have breached in any material respect its obligations
under this Agreement in any manner that will have proximately caused the
failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or
prior to the Outside Date.

(e) by Buyer (by written notice to Seller) or Seller (by written notice to
Buyer), if a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction has issued an Order
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and such Order has become final and non-appealable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a Party shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.01(e) _if that Partys breach of
this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby at or prior to such time.

10.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01_, all obligations of the Parties

_ 10.02_ and _Article XII_ hereof shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and (b) no termination of this Agreement will relieve a Party from
any liability arising from or relating to any (i) fraud or (ii) willful
breach of a covenant by such Party prior to such termination.

 

ARTICLE XI

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

11.01 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Liability for Taxes_.

 

(i) The Seller Group Members shall hold harmless, indemnify and defend each of
the Buyer Indemnitees from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse
each of the Buyer Indemnitees for, any Damages that are directly or indirectly
suffered or incurred at any time by any of the Buyer Indemnitees or to which
any of the Buyer Indemnitees may otherwise directly or indirectly become
subject at any time (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any
third party claim) and that arise directly or indirectly from or as a result
of: (A) Taxes

 



71

    

 imposed on any Group Company, or for which any Group Company may otherwise
be liable, as a result of having been a member of a Company Group, (B) Taxes
imposed on a Group Company, or for which a Group Company may otherwise be
liable, for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date
and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date, (C) Taxes imposed on a Buyer Group
Member as a result of such Buyer Group Member being a United States
shareholder (within the meaning of Section 951(b) of the Code) of any Group
Company, to the extent such amounts are attributable to Subpart F income
(within the meaning of Section 952(a) of the Code) of such Group Company
arising in (or that, but for the limitation under 952(c) of the Code, would
have arisen in) a taxable year of the Group Company ending on or prior to
the Closing Date or, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and (D) Taxes imposed
on a Seller for any taxable year or period and (E) the cost and expense
(including third party costs and expenses) of preparing Tax Returns for which
Buyer is responsible under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)_ to the extent such Tax
Returns relate to tax years or periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
or for which the Seller Group Members were responsible under _Section_ __ _
11.01(b)_.

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever it is necessary to determine
the liability for Taxes of a Group Company for a Straddle Period, the
determination of the Taxes of the Group Company for the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be determined
by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two (2) taxable years or
periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which
began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date and items of
income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Group Company for the Straddle
Period shall be allocated between such two (2) taxable years or periods on a
"closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Group Company
were closed at the close of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
exemptions, allowances, deductions or Taxes that are calculated on an annual
basis, such as ad valorem and other similar Taxes imposed on property ("
_Property Taxes_ "), franchise based solely on capital, and depreciation
deductions, shall be apportioned between such two (2) taxable years or periods
on a daily basis. In determining whether a Property Tax is attributable to
a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date or a Straddle Period (or
portion thereof), any Property Tax shall be deemed a Property Tax attributable
to the taxable period specified on the relevant Property Tax bill. For
purposes of  _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)(i)_, whenever it is necessary to
determine the liability for Taxes of a United States shareholder (within the
meaning of Section 951(b) of the Code) of a controlled foreign corporation
(within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code) attributable to amounts
included in the income of such United States shareholder under Section 951 of
the Code for the taxable year or period of such controlled foreign corporation
that begins on or before and ends after the Closing Date, the determination
of liability for any such Taxes shall be made by assuming that the taxable
year or period of the controlled foreign corporation consisted of two (2)
taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date
and the other of which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing
Date and relevant items of

 



72

    

 income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the controlled foreign
corporation shall be allocated between such two (2) taxable years or periods
on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the
controlled foreign corporation were closed at the close of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Subpart F income (within the meaning of Section
952 of the Code) of the controlled foreign corporation shall be determined
without regard to Section 952(c) of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, the
limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ shall not apply to the
indemnification obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)_.

(b) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) The Seller Group Members, at their own cost and expense, shall timely file
or cause to be timely filed when due (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) (x) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or
with respect to the Group Companies on a combined, consolidated or unitary
basis with any Seller Group Member and (y) all other Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to the Group Companies on or prior to
the Closing Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all Tax Returns with
respect to which any filing deadlines have already passed as of the date
of this Agreement, whether or not listed on _Schedule 3.08_ ). In each case
the Seller shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of
such Tax Returns. All Tax Returns that the Company is required to file or
cause to be filed in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)_ shall be
prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice and, on such Tax
Returns, no position shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is
inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in
preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods (including
positions, elections or methods that would have the effect of deferring income
to periods ending after the Closing Date or accelerating deductions to
periods ending on or before the Closing Date).

(ii) Buyer shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained) all other Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to the Group Companies after the
Closing Date. Buyer shall give Seller, at least fifteen (15) days in advance
of filing, the opportunity to review all Tax Returns required to be filed by
any of the Group Companies that include periods that end on or before the
Closing Date (including a Straddle Period) and shall consider in good faith
any comments provided by Seller in respect of such Tax Returns. Tax deductions
and other benefits attributable to the payment of Transaction Expenses and
other expenses borne by Seller in connection with completion of the
Transactions shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent
permitted by applicable law. Neither Buyer, Seller, nor any of their
Affiliates shall make any election under Section 338 of the Code with respect
to the Transactions. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall amend any
Tax Returns relating to the Group Companies with respect to any tax period
ending on or before the Closing Date or Straddle Period without the prior
written consent of the Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Any refunds of Taxes of the Group Companies for any
tax period ending on or before the Closing Date or Straddle Period (including
any credit in lieu of a refund) shall, to the extent the Taxes in respect of
which such refund was paid were borne by Seller, be for the benefit of the
Seller.

 



73

    

(c) _Contest Provisions_.

 

(i) Buyer shall notify Seller in writing upon receipt by Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or, after the Closing Date, the Group Company of notice of any
pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits or
assessments relating to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date or to any Straddle Period. Within ten (10) days after the Sellers
receipt of such notice, the Seller may elect by written notice to Buyer to
represent a Group Companys interests in any Tax audit or administrative or
court proceeding relating to a Tax liability for which Seller Group
Members would be required to indemnify Buyer Group Members pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)_ and that relates solely to a taxable year or period
ending on or before the Closing Date, and to employ counsel of Sellers choice
at Sellers expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) Seller shall have no
right to represent any Group Companys interests in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding unless Seller shall have first notified
Buyer in writing of Sellers intention to do so and of the identity of
counsel, if any, chosen by Seller in connection therewith, and (2) each Seller
Group Member shall have agreed with Buyer that, as between Buyer and Seller,
Seller shall be liable for any Damages that result from such audit or
proceeding; _provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer and its representatives shall
be permitted to be present at, and participate in, any such audit or
proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not enter into any
settlement or otherwise compromise any claim, assessment or audit that
adversely affects the Tax liability of Buyer, the Group Companies, or any
Affiliate of the foregoing for any period ending after the Closing Date
without the prior written consent of Buyer.

(ii) Should Seller not elect to contest the audit, claim or assessment under
_Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)(i)_ above, then Buyer shall have the sole right to
represent the Companys and each Subsidiarys interests in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding relating to a Tax liability for which
Seller would be required to indemnify Buyer Group Members pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 11.02(b)_ and that relates solely to a taxable year or period
ending on or before the Closing Date, and to employ counsel of Buyers choice
at Sellers expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller and its
Representatives shall be permitted, at Sellers expense, to be present at, and
participate in, any such audit or proceeding.

 

(iii) Nothing herein shall be construed to impose on Buyer any obligation to
defend the Group Companies in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)(i)_ above, any proceeding may
be settled or compromised in the discretion of Buyer, and any such settlement
or compromise shall not affect any Buyer Group Members right to
indemnification under this Agreement.

 



74

    

(d) _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, each of Seller and
Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to):

(i) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax
Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described in _Section_ __ _
12.03_ (relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes);

(ii) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other
party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 11.02(b)_, and in connection therewith, provide the other party with any
necessary powers of attorney;

 

(iii) cooperate fully in preparing for and defending any audits of, or
disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of any Group
Company;

(iv) make available to the other and to any taxing authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Group Companies; and

(v) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Group Companies; _provided_ , that
Buyer shall only be obligated to furnish copies of such correspondence to the
Company to the extent such audit or information request relates to Taxes for
which the Company may be liable under the terms of this Agreement.

 

(e) _Termination of Tax Allocation Arrangements_. Any Tax Sharing Arrangement
entered into by any Group Company (other than a Tax Sharing Arrangement to
which the sole parties are Group Companies) shall be terminated as to the
Group Companies on or prior to the Closing, and after the Closing the Group
Companies shall not have any liability thereunder.

 

(f) _Survival of Obligations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the obligations of the parties set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 11.01_ shall survive the Closing Date indefinitely and without limitation.

11.02  _Confidentiality_. Each Seller Group Member shall, and cause its
Affiliates and its and their Representatives to, keep confidential and not
directly or indirectly use, information relating to the Group Companies,
except (a) for information that is available to the public on the date hereof
or thereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 11.02_ and (b) as required by Law or
administrative process,  _provided_ , that in the case of clause (b), the
applicable Seller Group Member shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its
and their Representatives to, provide Buyer with advance written notice
thereof and cooperate with Buyer (at Buyers expense) to limit such
disclosure.

 



75

    

11.03 _Agreement Not To Compete_.

 

(a) Each Seller Group Member understands that Buyer shall be entitled to
protect and preserve the going concern value of the business of the Group
Companies to the extent permitted by Law and that Buyer would not have entered
into this Agreement absent the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 11.03_ and,
therefore, for a period of five (5) years from the Closing (the "
_Noncompetition Period_ "), each Seller Group Member shall not, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly:

 

(i) engage (as an owner, partner, member, shareholder, independent contractor,
director, officer, manager, employee, consultant, agent, researcher, advisor
or otherwise) or otherwise participate in any Competing Business, or establish
any new Competing Business, anywhere in the world, including (A) soliciting
any customer or prospective customer of the Group Companies to purchase any
goods or services sold, or being developed, by the Group Companies and (B)
assisting any Person in any way to do, or attempt to do, anything prohibited
by _clause (A)_ above; or

 

(ii) solicit, recruit or hire any individual that is as of the Closing Date,
or was within twelve (12) months prior to the Closing Date, an employee or
independent contractor of the Group Companies, or solicit or encourage any
such Person to leave the employment or service of the Group Companies.

 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the activities of and positions held by
Lewicki and Siemionow, as of the date hereof, in their respective roles as
investors and/or members of the board of directors of the companies set forth
on _Schedule 11.03(b)_ shall not be considered engaging in a Competing
Business for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 11.03_;  _provided_ , that in the
event any of such companies changes its activities and therefore becomes
engaged in a Competing Business (other than to the extent any of the
activities of such companies as of the date hereof may be considered
engaging in a Competing Business), the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
11.03_ shall apply, and then, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) neither Lewicki
nor Siemionow may thereafter participate in the management of such
company, participate in research and development of any product or service
for such company, make further investments in such company or participate or
engage in any other aspect of its business or affairs, and (ii) Lewicki and
Siemionow shall resign from director positions they hold with such company.

(c) _Section_ __ _ 11.03(a)_ shall be deemed not breached solely as a result
of the ownership by any Seller Group Member or any of its Affiliates of less
than an aggregate of 5% of any class of stock of a Person; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such stock is listed on a national securities exchange.

(d) In the event of an actual breach or violation by any Seller Group Member
or its Affiliates of a covenant in this this _Section_ __ _ 11.03_, the
Noncompetition Period shall be tolled until such breach or violation has been
duly cured.

 



76

    

(e) Each Seller Group Member agrees and acknowledges that the duration, scope
and geographic area of the covenants described in this _Section_ __ _ 11.03_
are fair, reasonable and necessary in order to protect the Companys goodwill
and other legitimate interests of the Group Companies as those interests
exist as of the date hereof. Each Seller Group Member understands that the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 11.03_ limits the ability of such Seller
Group Member and its Affiliates to invest in or otherwise be engaged with or
by a business similar to the business of the Group Companies.

11.04 _Release_. Each Seller Group Member, on behalf of such Seller Group
Member and each of such Seller Group Members current or former Affiliates
(other than the Group Companies), shareholders, officers and directors, hereby
releases and forever discharges each Group Company, and each of
their respective individual, joint or mutual, past, present and future
Representatives, successors and assigns (individually, a " _Releasee_ " and
collectively, " _Releasees_ ") from any and all claims, demands,
Legal Proceedings, causes of action and Orders that any Seller Group Member
or any of their respective current or former Affiliates (other than the Group
Companies), shareholders, officers and directors now have, have ever had or
may hereafter have against the respective Releasees, and from any and all
obligations, Contracts, debts, liabilities and obligations that any Releasee
now has, has ever had or may hereafter have in favor of any Seller Group
Member or any of their respective current or former Affiliates (other than
the Group Companies), shareholders, officers and directors, in each case of
any nature (whether absolute or contingent, asserted or unasserted, known or
unknown, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, and whether or not
accrued) arising contemporaneously with or before the Closing Date or on
account of or arising out of any matter, cause or event occurring
contemporaneously with or before the Closing Date (in each case other than any
obligations of Buyer arising under this Agreement or any Transaction Document
or any obligations which by their terms are to be performed after Closing
under the Real Property Leases) (collectively, the " _Released Claims_ ").
Each Seller Group Member hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from,
directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or commencing,
instituting or causing to be commenced, any Legal Proceeding of any kind
against any Releasee, based upon any Released Claim.

 

11.05 _Leases_. For a period of six (6) months following the Closing, the
Seller Group Members shall cause the applicable landlords of the Leased Real
Property located at ul. Kasprowicza 119E, nr lokalu 57, 01-949 Warszawa, and
ul. 23 lutego 4A, 61-741 Poznań, to (a) not terminate such leases during such
period and (b) waive all rent and other expenses for such leases during such
period. The Seller Group Members shall cause such applicable landlords, and
Buyer shall cause the applicable Group Companies, to terminate the leases for
such Leased Real Property effective thirty (30) days following written notice
from Buyer at any time following the Closing Date.

 

11.06 _Transaction Bonus Agreement_. Pursuant to the terms of that certain
Transaction Bonus Agreement, dated February 1, 2020, between Seller and
Luciano, Seller shall not pay Luciano any transaction bonus thereunder unless
and until Luciano delivers a release of claims in favor of the Group
Companies, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

 

11.07 _Change in Name_. Promptly following the Closing, Seller shall cause
Holo S.A. to change its corporate name to one which does not include or bear
any likeness to "Holosurgical", and shall deliver to Buyer evidence of the
same.

MISCELLANEOUS

12.01  _Press Releases and Public Announcements_. No Party will issue any
press release or make any similar public announcement relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement without the prior written approval of Buyer and the
Seller;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any Party may make any public

12.05 _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement will inure to the benefit
of, and be binding upon, the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder will be assignable by Buyer or the Seller Group Members; _provided_
, _however_ , that Buyer may (a) assign its rights under this Agreement to
any Affiliate of Buyer or to any future purchaser of Buyer or its assets or
(b) collaterally assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to
one or more lenders of Buyer or its Affiliates.

 

12.06 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality,
or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this
Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any
other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision is invalid,
illegal, or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that such court shall have
the power to, and it is their intention that such court shall, limit the term
or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid
or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable
as so modified, in order that the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. In the event such
court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the
parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable term.

12.07 _References_. The table of contents and the section and other headings
and subheadings contained in this Agreement and the exhibits hereto are solely
for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the Parties,
and will not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any exhibit hereto. All references to days (excluding Business
Days) or months will be deemed references to calendar days or months. All
references to "$" will be deemed references to United States dollars. Unless
the context otherwise requires,

 



79

    

 any reference to a "Section," "Exhibit," "Disclosure Schedule" or "Schedule"
will be deemed to refer to a section of this Agreement, an exhibit to
this Agreement or a schedule to this Agreement, as applicable. The words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import referring to
this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The word "including" or any variation
thereof means "including, without limitation" and will not be construed to
limit any general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items
or matters immediately following it. Each representation, warranty, covenant
and agreement contained in this Agreement shall have independent significance.
Accordingly, if any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement is breached, the fact that there exists another
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the same subject
matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) shall not detract
from or mitigate the breach of the first representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or
law will be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. All terms defined in this
Agreement will have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other
document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular
as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to
the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Where a word or phrase is
defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms shall have a corresponding
meaning. A reference to any party to this Agreement or any other agreement
shall include such partys predecessors, successors and permitted assigns.

12.08  _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 

12.09 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules hereto may be amended or waived only in a writing signed
(a) in the case of any amendment, by Buyer and the Seller Group Members and
(b) in the case of a waiver, by the Party or Parties waiving rights hereunder.
No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof will
extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent
breach or default.

12.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the documents and
agreements to be delivered pursuant hereto), along with the schedules and
exhibits hereto and thereto, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or
among the Parties, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to
the subject matter hereof. The exhibits and Schedules identified in this
Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof as
if set forth in full herein. The Confidentiality Agreement is hereby
terminated as of Closing.

12.11 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each Party, and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns any legal or equitable
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, except as provided in _Article IX_ with respect to which the Buyer
Indemnitees (which shall be third party beneficiaries of this Agreement).

12.12 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF
ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF
THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR
CAUSE OF ACTION WILL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

12.13 _Delivery by Facsimile or Email_. This Agreement and any signed
agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or scanned pages via electronic mail, will be treated in all
manner and respect as an original contract and will be considered to have the
same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person.

 

12.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or
more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
will constitute one agreement. Execution and delivery of this Agreement and
each other Transaction Document by exchange of electronically transmitted
counterparts bearing the signature of a Party will be equally as effective
as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of such Party.

12.15 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the exhibits
and schedules hereto will be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of Law
or conflict of Law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

12.16 _Jurisdiction_. Any Legal Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby will be brought and
determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware; ___provided_ that if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not
have jurisdiction, any such Legal Proceeding will be brought exclusively in
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or any other
court of the State of Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such Legal Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the exercise of personal jurisdiction over that party (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the express and knowing waiver of any claim that the
exercise of personal jurisdiction over a party incorporated in a foreign
jurisdiction is not permitted 

 



81

    

 under or is incompatible with Delaware or federal law or the United States
Constitution), the laying of the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in any
such court, or that any such Legal Proceeding that is brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Legal
Proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court, and without regard to any
protections or procedures provided by law, treaty or otherwise. Without
limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on such
Party as provided in _Section_ __ _ 12.04_ will be deemed effective service
of process on such Party and expressly waives any objection to the
effectiveness of such service under U.S. law or treaty.

12.17 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

12.18 _Specific Performance_. Each Party agrees that irreparable damage would
occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
in addition to any other remedies available under this Agreement, the Parties
agree that, prior to the termination of this Agreement, each Party will be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent any other Partys breach of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(including any Partys obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement if required to do so hereunder and including the
obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.02_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.03_).
Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly available
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives (i) any defenses in
any Legal Proceeding for an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief, including the defense that the other Parties have an
adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity and (ii) any requirement
under Law to post a bond, undertaking or other security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

12.19 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
Party, each party hereto shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to
be taken, all such further or other actions, as such other party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate or confirm the
Acquisition in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

12.20 _Disclosure Schedules_. All schedules attached hereto (each, a "
_Schedule_ " and, collectively, the " _Disclosure Schedules_ ") are
incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as though
completely set forth herein. All references to this Agreement herein or in
any of the Schedules will be deemed to refer to this entire Agreement,
including all Schedules. The Schedules have been arranged for purposes of
convenience in separately numbered sections corresponding to the sections of
this Agreement; however, any item disclosed in any part, subpart, section or
subsection of the Schedule referenced by a particular section or subsection in
this Agreement will be deemed to have been disclosed with respect to every
other part, subpart, section and subsection in another Schedule if the
relevance of such disclosure to such other part, subpart,

 



82

    

 section or subsection is reasonably apparent on its face, notwithstanding
the omission of an appropriate cross-reference. Any item of information,
matter or document disclosed or referenced in, or attached to, the Disclosure
Schedules will not (a) be used as a basis for interpreting the terms
"material," "Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement
or to establish a standard of materiality, (b) be deemed or interpreted to
expand the scope of the Buyers or the Seller Group Members respective
representations and warranties, obligations, covenants, conditions or
agreements contained herein or (c) constitute, or be deemed to constitute, an
admission to any third Person concerning such item or matter. No disclosure in
the Disclosure Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of any
agreement or Law will be construed as an admission or indication that any
such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. Capitalized terms
used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the
meanings given to them in this Agreement.
