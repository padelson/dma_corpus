ARTICLE 2

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 2.01 _The Merger._ (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation").

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than three Business Days after the date
the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or,
to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have
been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or
parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place,
at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree; _provided_ that, subject to the provisions of Article 9, if
the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), unless mutually agreed by the
Company and the Parent, the Closing shall take place on the second Business
Day immediately following the final day of the Marketing Period. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date".

 



11 (c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate
of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such
later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

Section 2.02 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time:

 

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(d) or
Section 2.05, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $14.00 in
cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time,
all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, in
each case to be issued or paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without
interest;

(b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto;

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted; and

 

(d) each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company
or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
such number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each
such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Section 2.03 _Surrender and Payment_ _._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of
exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares
of Company Stock (the "Certificates") and (ii) uncertificated shares of
Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Parent shall cause NICE Systems
Inc. to make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the
Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send,
or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company
Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

 



12 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company
Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be
properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be returned
to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of
Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
the Merger Consideration, in respect of such shares without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any
holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock two years
after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time
when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



13 Section 2.04 _Treatment of Equity Awards_ _._ (a) At the Effective Time,
each vested Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Vested Option") shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of shares of Company Stock subject to the Vested Option by (y) the
excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per share of the Vested Option (with the aggregate payment rounded down
to the nearest cent), less applicable Tax withholding. For the avoidance of
doubt, each Vested Option with an exercise price that is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled without any consideration to
the holder thereof. All such amounts payable with respect to the Vested
Options shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation as soon as
practicable (and in any event within ten Business Days) following the
Effective Time.

(b) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company Stock Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (an
"Unvested Option"), shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a right to acquire shares
of Company Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to
purchase the number of Parent ADSs (each, an "Adjusted Stock Option") equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Company
Stock subject to such Unvested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional Parent ADSs
rounded down to the next lower whole number of Parent ADSs. Each Adjusted
Stock Option shall have an exercise price per Parent ADS (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to (1) the per share exercise price for the shares
of Company Stock subject to such Unvested Option divided by (2) the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio. Each Adjusted Stock Option shall otherwise be subject to
the same terms and conditions applicable to the converted Company Stock Option
under the Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing
grants thereunder, including as to vesting. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the foregoing, in all cases, the exercise price of, and the number
of Parent ADSs subject to, each Adjusted Stock Option shall be determined as
necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and for any Unvested
Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification
under any of Sections 422 through 424 of the Code, the option price, the
number of Parent ADS subject to such option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such option shall be determined in order to comply with Section
424 of the Code.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each vested Company RSU that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Vested RSU"), shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of shares of Company Stock subject to the Vested RSU, as applicable, by
(y) the amount of the Merger Consideration, less applicable Tax withholding.
All such amounts payable with respect to the Vested RSUs shall be paid by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable (and in any event
within ten Business Days) following the Effective Time.

 



14 (d) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company RSU (an "Unvested RSU") that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to
represent a right with respect to shares of Company Stock and shall be
converted automatically into a restricted stock unit with respect to a number
of Parent ADSs (each, an "Adjusted RSU") equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Company Stock subject to the
Unvested RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio, with any fractional Parent ADSs rounded down to the next lower
whole number of shares. Each Adjusted RSU shall otherwise be subject to the
same terms and conditions applicable to the converted Company RSU under the
Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including
as to vesting and settlement.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, each unvested share of Company Restricted Stock
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease
to represent a share of Company Stock and shall be converted automatically
into a number of restricted Parent ADSs (collectively, the
"Adjusted Restricted Stock") equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
a share of Company Restricted Stock by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio,
with any fractional shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of
shares. Each share of Adjusted Restricted Stock shall otherwise be subject to
the same terms and conditions applicable to the converted Company Restricted
Stock under the Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing grants
thereunder, including as to vesting.

(f) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company or the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which
are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.04 and
Parent, Parents Board of Directors and its compensation committee, as
applicable, shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary for the
assumption by Parent of the Adjusted Stock Options, Adjusted RSUs and Adjusted
Restricted Stock; provided that no action taken by the Company, the Board of
Directors of the Company or the compensation committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall be irrevocable until
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(g) Parent shall register that number of Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to the
Adjusted Stock Options, Adjusted RSUs and Adjusted Restricted Stock on an
effective registration statement on Form S-8 as promptly as practicable after
the Closing Date (but in any event not more than thirty calendar days after
the Closing Date). Parent shall maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as such Adjusted Stock Options, Adjusted
RSUs and Adjusted Restricted Stock remain outstanding and shall reserve a
sufficient number of shares of Parent ADSs for issuance upon exercise or
settlement thereof.

 



15 Section 2.05 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with
Delaware Law shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise
loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, such shares
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares,
and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent,
the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or
settle, any such demands.

Section 2.06 _Withholding Rights_ _._ Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the
Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Exchange
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

 

Section 2.07 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this Article 2.

ARTICLE 3

 

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

 

Section 3.01 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation
of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
Applicable Law.

Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with Applicable Law.

with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers
of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



16 ARTICLE 4

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Subject to Section 11.05, except as disclosed in any Company SEC Document
filed or furnished after December 31, 2014 and before the date of this
Agreement or as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
represents and warrants to Parent that:

 

Section 4.01 _Corporate Existence and Power_. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all governmental
licenses, franchises, authorizations, permits, certificates, consents and
approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for
those licenses, franchises, authorizations, permits, certificates, consents
and approvals the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that have the concept of good
standing) in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except
for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent
true and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Company as in effect on the date hereof.

Section 4.02 _Corporate Authorization_ _._ (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys
corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the Companys
stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Company Stock is the only vote of the holders of any of the Companys
capital stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger (the
"Company Stockholder Approval"). This Agreement constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting
creditors rights generally and general principles of equity).

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Companys Board of Directors
has (i) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders, (ii) unanimously approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) unanimously
resolved, subject to Section 6.03(b), to recommend approval and adoption of
this Agreement by its stockholders (such recommendation, the "Company
Board Recommendation").

 



17 Section 4.03 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority other than (i) the
filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the
Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified to do business,
(ii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and of laws
analogous to the HSR Act existing in foreign jurisdictions and set forth on
Section 4.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (iii) compliance with any
applicable requirements of NASDAQ, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and
any other applicable state or federal securities laws, (iv) filings as may be
required with, submissions as may be necessary or advisable to, and permits,
authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required from, the
FCC (including any review by Team Telecom), (v) filings as may be required
with, submissions as may be necessary or advisable to, and clearances,
permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required from, State
and Local Authorities, including those related to any financing contemplated
under this Agreement, (vi) filings as may be required with, submissions as may
be necessary or advisable to, and clearances, permits, authorizations,
consents and approvals as may be required from, CFIUS in order to obtain the
CFIUS Approval and (vii) any actions or filings the absence of which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

Section 4.04 _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii) assuming compliance with
the matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene, conflict with or result
in a violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law with respect
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 4.03, require any consent or other action by
any Person under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, under, or cause
or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any
right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any agreement or other
instrument binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
license, franchise, authorization, permit, certificate, consent, approval or
other similar authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets
or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any asset
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with only such exceptions, in the
case of each of clauses (ii) through (iv), as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

Section 4.05  _Capitalization_ _._ The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of (i) 100,000,000 shares of Company Stock and (ii)
15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value (the "Preferred
Stock"). As of May 16, 2016, there were outstanding (A) 61,959,236 shares of
Company Stock, (B) no shares of Preferred

 



18  Stock and (C)(1) Company Stock Options to purchase an aggregate of 2,753,608

Section 4.17 _Employees and Employee Benefit Plans_. (a) Section 4.17(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete list
identifying each material Employee Plan and specifies whether such plan is a
US Plan or an International Plan. For each material US Plan, the Company has
provided to Parent (i) a copy of such plan (or a description, if such plan is
not written) and all amendments thereto, as applicable, (ii) all trust
agreements, insurance contracts or other funding arrangements and amendments
thereto, (iii) the current prospectus or summary plan description and all
summaries of material modifications thereto, (iv) the most recent favorable
determination or opinion letter from the IRS, (v) the most recently filed
annual return/report (Form 5500) and accompanying schedules and attachments
thereto, (vi) the most recently prepared actuarial report and financial
statements. For each material International Plan (other than such plans that
are maintained by a Governmental Authority), the Company has provided to
Parent documents that are substantially comparable (taking into account
differences in Applicable Law and practices) to the documents required to be
provided in clauses (i) through (vi).

 

(b) The Company has provided to Parent a schedule that sets forth, for each
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, his or her name (or
employee identification number), title, annual base salary, most recent annual
bonus received and current annual bonus opportunity. Not later than ten days
after the date hereof, the Company will provide Parent with a revised version
of such schedule that sets forth the information specified in the immediately
preceding sentence and each such employees employer, hire date, location,
whether full- or part-time and whether active or on leave (and, if on leave,
the nature of the leave and the expected return date). Five Business

 



30  Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will provide Parent with a
revised version of the schedule described in the immediately preceding
sentence, updated as of ten days prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the remainder of this Section 4.17(b), the
information provided by the Company regarding employees will be anonymized to
the extent reasonably necessary for compliance with Applicable Law. As of the
date hereof, no Key Employee has notified the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in writing (or otherwise to the knowledge of the Company) that he
or she intends to resign or retire as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise within six months after the
Closing Date.

(c) With respect to any Employee Plan covered by Subtitle B, Part 4 of Title I
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, no non-exempt prohibited transaction
has occurred that has caused or would reasonably be expected to cause the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any material liability under ERISA
or the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates (nor any
predecessor of any such entity) sponsors, maintains, administers or
contributes to (or has any obligation to contribute to), or has in the past
six years sponsored, maintained, administered or contributed to (or had any
obligation to contribute to), or has or is reasonably expected to have any
direct or indirect liability with respect to, any plan that is (i) subject to
Title IV of ERISA or (ii) a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37)
of ERISA).

(d) Each Employee Plan, and any award thereunder, that is or forms part of a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A
or 457A of the Code has been timely amended (if applicable) to comply and has
been operated in material compliance with, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries have materially complied in practice and operation with, all
applicable requirements of Section 409A and 457A of the Code, and no amounts
currently deferred or to be deferred under any such plan would be not
determinable when otherwise includible in income under Section 457A of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to
gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any current or former Service
Provider for any Tax incurred by such Service Provider, including under
Section 409A, 457A or 4999 of the Code.

(e) Each US Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has been established pursuant to a preapproved prototype plan for which
an IRS opinion letter has been obtained, and no circumstances exist that would
reasonably be expected to result in any such opinion letter being revoked or
the Companys reliance on same being rejected by the IRS or a penalty under
the IRS Closing Agreement Program if discovered during an IRS audit or
investigation. Each US Plan has been maintained in compliance with its terms
and with the requirements of Applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code,
except for failures to comply or violations that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. No events have occurred with respect to any US Plan that
could result in payment or assessment by or against the Company of any
material excise taxes under ERISA, the Code or other Applicable Law.

 



31 (f) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all contributions, premiums
and payments that are due have been made for each Employee Plan within the
time periods prescribed by the terms of such plan and Applicable Law, and all
contributions, premiums and payments for any period ending on or before the
Closing Date that are not due are properly accrued to the extent required to
be accrued under applicable accounting principles. There has been no amendment
to, written interpretation of or announcement (whether or not written) by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any Employee Plan that would materially
increase the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of expense
incurred in respect thereof for the most recently completed fiscal year.

(g) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or together
with any other event) will (i) entitle any current or former Service Provider
to any payment or benefit, including any bonus, retention, severance,
retirement or job security payment or benefit, (ii) enhance any benefits or
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or
increase the amount payable or trigger any other obligation under, any
Employee Plan or otherwise, or (iii) limit or restrict the right of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, after Closing, Parent, to merge, amend
or terminate any Employee Plan (for the avoidance of doubt excluding
International Plans mandated by Applicable Law). There is no contract, plan or
arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any current or former Service
Provider that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of
any amount that would not be deductible due to the application of Section
280G of the Code.

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any current or
projected liability for, and no Employee Plan provides or promises, any post-
employment or post-retirement medical, dental, disability, hospitalization,
life or similar benefits (whether insured or self-insured) to any current or
former Service Provider (other than coverage mandated by Applicable Law,
including the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985).

 

(i) There is no action, suit, investigation, audit, proceeding or claim (or
any basis therefore) (other than routine claims for benefits) pending against
or involving, or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened against or involving
any Employee Plan before any arbitrator or any Governmental Authority,
including the IRS or the Department of Labor that, if determined or
resolved adversely in accordance with the plaintiffs demands, would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries are, and have been since
January 1, 2013, in compliance with all Applicable Laws with respect to labor
relations, employment and employment practices, including those relating to
labor management relations, wages, hours, overtime, employee classification,
discrimination, sexual harassment, civil rights, affirmative action, work
authorization, immigration, safety and health, information privacy and
security, workers compensation, continuation coverage under group health
plans, wage payment and the payment and withholding of Taxes, except for
failures to comply or violations that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 



32 (j) Each International Plan (i) has been maintained in compliance with its
terms and Applicable Law, except for failures to comply or violations that
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) if intended to qualify for
special tax treatment, complies in all material respects with all the
requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if required, to any extent, to be
funded, book-reserved or secured by an insurance policy, is fully funded,
book-reserved or secured by an insurance policy, as applicable, based on
reasonable actuarial assumptions in accordance with applicable accounting
principles. From and after the Closing Date, Parent and its Affiliates will
receive the full benefit of any funds, accruals and reserves under the
International Plans for use in accordance with the terms of the applicable
plan and Applicable Law.

or subject to, or is currently negotiating in connection with entering into,

period ending on the date hereof, there has not been any organizational
campaign, petition or other unionization activity seeking recognition of a
collective bargaining unit relating to any Service Provider. There are no, and
for the five-year period ending on the date hereof there have not been
any, labor strikes, slowdowns, stoppages, picketing, interruptions of work or
lockouts pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened against or
affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no material unfair
labor practice complaints pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before the National Labor
Relations Board or any other Governmental Authority or any current union
representation questions involving Service Providers. The consent or
consultation of, or the rendering of formal advice by, any labor or trade
union, works council or other employee representative body is not required for
the Company to enter into this Agreement or to consummate any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(l) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is, and has been, in material
compliance with WARN and has no liabilities or other obligations thereunder.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that
would reasonably be expected to cause Parent or any of its Affiliates to have
any material liability or other obligation following the Closing Date under
WARN as determined without regard to any action taken after the Closing.

not (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section
5.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any
provision of any Applicable Law, (iii) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in Section 5.03, require any consent or other action by any Person
under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default, under, or cause or permit the
termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or
obligation or the loss of any benefit to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any agreement or
other instrument binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any
license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval or other similar
authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets or business of
the Parent and its Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the creation or imposition
of any Lien on any asset of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, with only
such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii) through (iv), as would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

Section 5.05 _Disclosure Documents_. The information supplied by Parent for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, at the time the Proxy Statement and
any amendments or supplements thereto is first mailed to the stockholders of
the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholder Approval contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 

Section 5.06 _Finders  Fees_. There is no investment banker, broker, finder
or other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on
behalf of Parent who might be entitled to any fee or commission from the
Company or any of its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



40 Section 5.07 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no action,
suit, investigation or proceeding pending against, or, to the knowledge of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary, threatened against, or any order, judgment,
ruling or decree imposed upon, Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any of their
respective Affiliates before (or, in the case of threatened actions, suits,
investigations or proceedings, would be before) or by (or, in the case of
threatened actions, suits, investigations or proceedings, would be by) any
Governmental Authority or arbitrator, that would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger or other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.08 _Ownership of Shares_. None of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any
of their respective Affiliates (i) is, or has been at any time during the
last three (3) years, an "interested stockholder" of the Company, as defined
in Section 203 of Delaware Law or (ii) owns (directly or indirectly,
beneficially or of record), or is a party to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of,
any shares of capital stock of the Company other than this Agreement, other
than shares over which Parent or its Subsidiaries has no voting
or dispositive power and held in investment funds or other managed accounts
with Third Party managers.

Section 5.09 _Financing_. 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company duly executed Debt Commitment Letters
(and together with any fee letter related thereto, as the same may be
amended, modified or replaced in accordance with Section 7.04 and together
with all annexes, exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto, the
"Financing Commitments") pursuant to which the parties thereto have agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide or cause to be
provided the financing contemplated thereby (the "Debt Financing"), _provided_
that for purposes of this Agreement, the Debt Financing shall also include,
after the date hereof, to the extent alternative financing from alternative
financial institutions is obtained in accordance with this Agreement, any such
alternative financing). There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the investing of the full amount of the Debt
Financing, as of the date of this Agreement, other than as set forth in the
Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof, there are no side letters or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the funding of the
Debt Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments
and delivered to the Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement, that
could adversely affect the availability of the full amount of the Debt
Financing.

(b) As of the date hereof (i) the Financing Commitments are in full force and
effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified in any respect; (ii) the Financing Commitments, in
the form so delivered, are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, the
other parties thereto (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting
creditors rights generally and general principles of equity); and (iii) no
event has occurred to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Subsidiary which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach
on the part 

 



41  of Parent or Merger Subsidiary under any term, or a failure of any
condition, of the Financing Commitments or otherwise result in any portion of
the Debt Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. As of the date
hereof, subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in Article 4 hereof, and the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 hereof, neither Parent nor Merger
Subsidiary has reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely
basis any term or condition contained in the Financing Commitments required to
be satisfied by it or that any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated
thereby will be unavailable to Parent and Merger Subsidiary at the Effective
Time. Parent and Merger Subsidiary have fully paid any and all commitment fees
or other fees in connection with the Financing Commitments that are due
and payable on or before the date of this Agreement.

(c) Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing
Commitments, as of the date hereof, the aggregate net proceeds from the Debt
Financing provided under the Financing Commitments are, together with the
aggregate cash held by Parent and its Subsidiaries (which funds held by such
Subsidiaries will be available to consummate the Merger as of the Closing),
sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Parent and/or
Merger Subsidiary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and are sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents and Merger
Subsidiarys obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of all
amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article 2, any repayment or
refinancing of indebtedness of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries required in connection with the Merger, and
the payment of all associated costs and expenses of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d) The obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary under this Agreement are
not contingent in any respect upon the funding of the amounts contemplated to
be funded pursuant to the Financing Commitments. The obligations of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary under this Agreement are not subject to any conditions
regarding Parents, Merger Subsidiarys, their respective Affiliates, or any
other Persons ability to obtain financing for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.10 _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of
any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this
Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. The
vote or consent of NICE Systems Inc. as the sole stockholder of Merger
Subsidiary (which shall have occurred prior to the Effective Time) is the
only vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
Merger Subsidiary necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.11 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary is entering into
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors. Immediately after giving
effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the payment of the Merger Consideration and all other amounts required to be
paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any repayment or refinancing of

 



42  indebtedness of the Company required in connection with the Merger, assuming
(i) satisfaction of the conditions to the obligation of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary to consummate the Merger as set forth herein, (ii) the accuracy in
all material respects of the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in Article 4, and (iii) the Companys compliance in all material
respects with its covenants under Article 6 and Article 8, the Surviving
Corporation will be solvent (as such term is used under Delaware Law).

Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries respective operations.

Section 6.02 _Proxy Statement; Company Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare (with
Parents cooperation to the extent required) and file with the SEC a
preliminary Proxy Statement that complies in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and
other applicable Law as soon as practicable following the date hereof (and in
any event will file the preliminary Proxy Statement no later than twenty
Business Days after the date of this Agreement).

 



45 (b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to
any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC on the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within five Business Days) following the later of (i) the resolution of any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the preliminary
Proxy Statement and (ii) the expiration of the ten day waiting period provided
in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (the later of (i) and
(ii), the "Clearance Date")). The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any
request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent with
copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, or written response to staff comments on, the Proxy Statement
will be made by the Company, without providing Parent and its counsel
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (which period shall
not exceed five Business Days) and giving reasonable consideration in good
faith to such comments. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder
Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) any information relating
to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, is discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly file
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information with
the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminate such
amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company.

 

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to duly call, establish
a record date for, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement
(the "Company Stockholder Meeting"), so that the Company Stockholder Meeting
occurs as soon as possible following the Clearance Date, in accordance
with Applicable Law and the Companys certificate of incorporation and
bylaws. The Company shall not adjourn, postpone, cancel, recess or reschedule
the Company Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ that (i) the Company may postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent
of Parent (but after consultation with Parent) (A) if as of the time for which
the Company Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Company Stockholder Meeting or to the extent that at such time
the Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting, (B) to allow
time for the filing and dissemination of,

 



46  and a sufficient period for evaluation by the Companys stockholders of, any
supplemental or amended disclosure document to the extent that the Companys
Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel) is necessary or required under applicable Law
or (C) as otherwise required by Applicable Law or any court of competent
jurisdiction and (ii) the Company shall postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting up to two times for up to 30 days each time (but not later
than 10 days prior to the End Date) upon the request of Parent to the extent
that at such time the Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow
the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder
Meeting. Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected an
Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 6.03(c), the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval
and shall include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall submit this
Agreement for adoption by its stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting
whether or not an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred; provided
that the Proxy Statement shall include, if applicable, the disclosure of the
Adverse Recommendation Change.

Section 6.03 _No Solicitation; Other Offers_ _._ (a) _General Prohibitions_.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
consultants, or other agents or advisors to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the
submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist,
participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any Third Party that is
seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to make,
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board
Recommendation (or recommend an Acquisition Proposal) (any of the foregoing in
this clause (iii), an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (iv) fail to enforce
or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than in connection with a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal, (v) approve any transaction under, or any Person becoming an
"interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of Delaware Law or (vi) enter into
any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar
instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal. It is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of
this Section by the Company.

 



47 (b) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), at any time prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval:

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (A)
engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party and its
Representatives that, subject to the Companys compliance with Section
6.03(a), has made after the date of this Agreement a _bona fide_ ,
written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, a Superior Proposal and (B) furnish to such Third Party or its
Representatives non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be
provided for informational purposes only to Parent) with such Third Party with
terms in all material respects no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the confidentiality agreement dated November 25, 2014 between the
Company and Parent (as amended by Amendment Number 1 dated December 6, 2015,
the "Confidentiality Agreement"), excluding any standstill provision included
therein ( _provided_ that, in such case, any standstill provision included in
the Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically cease to apply and be of no
further force and effect); _provided_ that all such information (to the
extent that such information has not been previously provided or made
available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may
be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or
made available to such Third Party);

(ii) subject to compliance with Section 6.03(d), the Board of Directors of
the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change (A) following receipt of
a Superior Proposal or (B) in response to an Intervening Event; and

 

(iii) subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in Section
10.01(d)(i) the Company may terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal;

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii), only if
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Delaware Law.

 

(c) _Required Notices_. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take
any of the actions referred to in Section 6.03(b) unless the Company shall
have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it
intends to take such action, and, after taking such action, the Company shall
continue to advise Parent on a prompt basis of the status and terms of
any discussions and negotiations with the Third Party. In addition, the
Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours)
after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any written
(or, in the case of receipt by the Company or any of its directors, officers
or investment bankers, oral) Acquisition Proposal or request for information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party that has made, or that the Company in good
faith believes is considering making, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the Third 

 



48  Party making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed,
on a current basis, of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request, and shall promptly (but in no event later
than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all correspondence
and other written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that describes any terms or conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal (as well as written summaries of any additional or modified material
terms or conditions, to the extent not already provided to Parent, conveyed
orally to the Company, within 48 hours of receipt by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries). Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be
deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Companys
compliance with this Section 6.03(c).

(d) " _Last Look_ ". Further, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition Proposal
(or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i)), unless (i) the
Company notifies Parent (which notice shall not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change), in writing at least four Business Days before taking
that action, of its intention to do so (such period, the "Negotiation
Period"), attaching (A) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be
made following receipt of a Superior Proposal, the most current version of
the proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be
consummated and the identity of the Third Party making the Acquisition
Proposal, or (B) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made
in response to an Intervening Event, a reasonably detailed description of the
reasons for making such Adverse Recommendation Change, and (ii) Parent does
not make, within four Business Days after its receipt of that written
notification, an offer that (A) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation
Change to be made following receipt of a Superior Proposal, is at least as
favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view as
such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that in the event there is any material
modification to the terms of any such Superior Proposal (including any
modification in the amount, form or mix of consideration proposed to be
payable to the Companys stockholders pursuant to such Superior Proposal),
the Company shall have provided to Parent a notice of such modification and
such Superior Proposal shall be deemed a new Superior Proposal to which the
requirements of this Section 6.03(d) shall apply; _provided_ , further that
with respect to such new Superior Proposal, the Negotiation Period shall be
deemed to be a two Business Day period rather than a four Business Day period
(except that such Negotiation Period shall not expire earlier than the
original Negotiation Period would have expired) or (B) in the case of an
Adverse Recommendation Change to be made in response to an Intervening Event,
obviates the need for such recommendation change.

(e) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal obtained
after the date hereof and not in violation of Section 6.03 that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after considering the
advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside
legal counsel, taking into account all terms of such Acquisition Proposal that
the Companys Board of Directors deems relevant (including any termination or
break-up fees and conditions to consummation) and the

 



49  reasonable likelihood of consummation of such Acquisition Transaction, would
be more favorable from a financial point of view to the Companys stockholders
(in their capacity as such) than the Merger (taking into account any proposal
by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(d));
_provided_ that for purposes of this definition, all references to "25%" in
the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be "50%."

(f) _Definition of Intervening Event_. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Intervening Event" means any material change, event, occurrence or
development that occurs, arises or becomes known to the Board of Directors of
the Company after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, to the extent that such change, event,
occurrence or development was unknown to the Board of Directors of the Company
and was not reasonably foreseeable, in each case, as of the date of this
Agreement; provided that the receipt by the Company, the existence or the
terms of an Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Proposal shall not, in any
event, be deemed to constitute an Intervening Event.

 

(g) _Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly request that each Third
Party, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the
12-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration
of any Acquisition Proposal and that is in possession of confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to return or destroy all such confidential
information (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of
such Person that contains, reflects or analyzes that information). The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure all such certifications as
promptly as practicable.

 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board of Directors
of the Company from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under
United States federal or state law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal,
including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9, 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act, (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, it being agreed that the making of such communication shall not
be an Adverse Recommendation Change or (iii) making any disclosure to the
Companys stockholders that is required by Applicable Law; provided, however,
that any such disclosure or communication that constitutes or contains an
Adverse Recommendation Change shall only be made in accordance with Section
6.03.

Section 6.04 _Access to Information_. Subject to the last sentence of this
Section 6.04, from the date hereof until the Effective Time and subject to

knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall

hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, under no
circumstances shall the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives be required to furnish any person with, or be required to
provide access to any person to, information about the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is prohibited by any Applicable Law or contractual restraint
enforceable upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or where such access
to information would reasonably be expected to involve the waiver of any
attorney-client privilege; _provided_ that, in each such case, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any required consent or
develop alternative arrangements (including, in the case of access that
would reasonably be expected to involve the waiver of any attorney-client
privilege, entry into a joint defense agreement) reasonably acceptable to the
Company and Parent so that such information can be furnished to Parent in a
manner that does not violate any Applicable Law or contractual restraint or
involve the waiver of any attorney-client privilege.

Section 6.05  _Stockholder Litigation_. Until the earlier of the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Effective Time, the
Company will promptly provide Parent with any pleadings and correspondence
relating to any stockholder litigation or dispute against the Company or any

contemplated hereby (including derivative claims) and will keep Parent
reasonably informed regarding the status of any such litigation or dispute.
The Company will cooperate with and, to the extent reasonably practicable,
give Parent the opportunity to consult and participate with respect to the
defense or settlement of any such Proceeding (at Parents expense), and the
Company will not agree to any such settlement without the prior written
consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

under the Company Notes Indenture that arise as a result of the execution,

change any method of tax accounting, file any material amended Tax Returns or
claims for material Tax refunds, enter into any material closing agreement,
surrender any material Tax claim, audit or

 



51  assessment, surrender or settle any right to claim a material Tax refund,
offset or other reduction in Tax liability, consent to any extension or waiver

Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall establish or cause to be
established in accordance with GAAP on or before the Effective Time an
adequate accrual for all material Taxes due with respect to any period or
portion thereof ending prior to or as of the Effective Time.

to such Taxes and fees, shall be the sole responsibility of such holder.

Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article 10 and the Effective Time, the Company

Subsidiaries Representatives to, at Parents sole expense (solely with
respect to reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses

reports as of and for periods both before and after the date hereof as are
identified in paragraph 8 of Exhibit C of the Debt Commitment Letters and
within the time periods set forth

 



52  therein, provided that such financial statements shall be provided in a

the preparation of any pro forma financial information or projections
promptly upon request of Parent, making the Companys and its Subsidiaries
senior officers available at reasonable times and for a reasonable number of
meetings to assist the Debt Financing Parties (including by way of

agencies), and otherwise reasonably cooperating in connection with
the consummation of the Debt Financing (including the due diligence process)
and reasonable marketing efforts with respect thereto (including assisting

memoranda (including a bank information memorandum that does not include
material non-public information and the delivery of customary authorization
letters with respect to the bank information memoranda executed by a senior
officer of the Company) and similar documents required or necessary in
connection with the Debt Financing);

(iii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain from the Companys and its
Subsidiaries accounting firm accountants comfort letters and consents
customary for debt financings, and assisting Parent and its counsel with
information required for customary legal opinions required to be delivered in

authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders or

53  Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any out-of-pocket expenses
and costs reasonably incurred in connection with the Companys or its
Affiliates obligations under this Section 6.08(a) (in accordance with
Section 6.09).

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

 

(i) nothing in this Agreement shall require any cooperation to the extent that
it would require the Board of Directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action that would be effective prior to the Effective
Time or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives, as
applicable, to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement, agree to pay
any commitment or other fees or reimburse any expenses (for which the Company

of this Agreement) or to approve the execution or delivery of any document or
certificate in connection with the Debt Financing (or any alternative
financing) prior to the Effective Time;

all information and assistance required from the Company for Parent to
prepare the Required Financial Information (the "Company RFI Support"), it may
deliver to Parent a written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it

which case the Company shall be deemed to have completed delivery of the
Company RFI Support and the Marketing Period shall commence no later than the
later of (x) 30 Specified Business Days after the date hereof and (y) 10
Specified Business Days after delivery of the Company RFI Notice; _provided_
that, if Parent in good faith reasonably believes the Company has not
completed providing the Company RFI Support, then Parent may, not later than
5:00 p.m. (New York time) four Specified Business Days after the delivery of
the Company RFI Notice by the Company, deliver a written notice to the Company
to that effect (stating with specificity the extent to which the Company

which case the Marketing Period shall commence no later than 10 Specified
Business Days after the Company has provided the additional Company RFI
Support or corrected the initial Company RFI Support in order to resolve the
Company RFI Support Deficiency.

 



54 __(d) The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of the Company s and
its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing, _provided_
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or good will of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their logos and on such other customary terms and conditions as the
Company shall reasonably impose. __

compliance with Section 6.08 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company
and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Representatives from and

connection therewith (except with respect to any information provided by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives), except in the event such losses, damages, claims, fees,
costs or expenses arose out of or result from the fraud, gross negligence,
recklessness, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives.



 

ARTICLE 7

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT

 

Parent agrees, and solely with respect to Section 7.04, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary agree, that:

 

Section 7.01 _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement. Immediately following the execution of this Agreement,
Parent shall cause NICE Systems Inc. to execute and deliver, in
accordance with Section 228 of the Delaware Law and in its capacity as the
sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary, a written consent adopting this
Agreement and approve the Merger in accordance with Delaware Law.

 

Section 7.02 _Director and Officer Liability_. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of
the Company (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by
Delaware Law or any 

 



55  other Applicable Law or provided under the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that such
indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time
under Applicable Law.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

 

 __(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors  and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " __D andO Insurance __"),
in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period of time at or prior to the Effective Time with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under the Company s existing policies with respect to any
actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in
such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby); _provided_ that the Company shall give Parent a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of such tail policy
and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by Parent with respect thereto; and _provided further_ that in
no event shall the Company expend for such policies an aggregate premium
amount in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last
full fiscal year, which amount is set forth in Section 7.02(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the " __Maximum Amount __"). If the Company or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue to
maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time, the D andO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase comparable DandO Insurance
for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies
pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of the
Maximum Amount; and _provided further_ that if the aggregate premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount. __

 



56 (d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.02.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.02 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "
__Indemnification ____Agreements __"). These rights, including the
Indemnification Agreements, shall survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person and
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in
any material respect any Indemnified Person without the consent of such
affected Indemnified Person, subject to Applicable Law.

 

Section 7.03 _Employee Matters_. (a) During the period beginning at the
Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (or
such shorter period of employment, as the case may be), Parent shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to each employee who is actively employed
by the Company or its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (each, a "Covered
Employee"), (i) a base salary or rate of pay that is at least equal to such
Covered Employees base salary or rate of pay immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except that any such base salary or rate of pay may be
reduced in connection with any across the board reduction in base salary or
rate of pay of all similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries) and (ii) other compensation, severance protections and
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
other compensation and employee benefits (other than equity compensation and
other long term incentives, change in control, retention, transition, stay or
similar arrangements) that were provided to such Covered Employee under the
Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) _Crediting of Payments_. In the event any Covered Employee first becomes
eligible to participate under any employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Parent Plan")
following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries
to use reasonable best efforts to: (i) waive any preexisting condition
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such Covered Employee (and any eligible dependents
thereof) under any Parent Plan providing medical, dental or vision benefits to
the same extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the
Employee Plan such Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to
coverage under such Parent Plan and (ii) provide such Covered Employee with
credit for any copayments, coinsurance and deductibles paid under an Employee
Plan prior to such Covered Employees coverage under any Parent Plan during
the calendar year in which such amount was paid, to the same extent such
credit was given under the Employee Plan such Covered Employee participated in
immediately prior to coverage under such Parent Plan in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such Parent Plan.

 



57 (c) _Service Crediting_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, recognize all service of each Covered Employee
prior to the Effective Time with the Company and its Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor entities of either to the extent the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries provides such past-service credit under a similar Employee Plan)
for all purposes including vesting, eligibility and benefit accrual purposes
(except for benefit accrual under any defined benefit retirement plan). In no
event shall anything contained in this Section 7.03(c) result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(d) _Company 401(k) Plans_. At the request of Parent no later than five
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions
necessary so that effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall terminate (i) the Companys 401(k) Plan, (ii) the Uptivity
401(k) Plan and (iii) any other 401(k) plan maintained by the Company or its
Subsidiaries pursuant to resolutions of the Companys Board of Directors that
are reasonably satisfactory to Parent. In connection with any termination of
such plans, Parent shall permit each Covered Employee to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including all participant loans) in cash or
notes (in the case of participant loans) in an amount equal to the eligible
rollover distribution portion of the account balance distributed to each such
Covered Employee from such plan to an "eligible retirement plan" (within
the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(e) _ESPP_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions,
including adopting any resolutions or amendments, with respect to the
Companys 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") to: (i) cause the
Participation Period (as defined in the ESPP) ongoing as of the date of this
Agreement to be the final Participation Period under the ESPP and the options
under the ESPP to be exercised on the earlier of (x) the scheduled purchase
date for such Participation Period and (y) the date that is seven Business
Days prior to the Effective Time (with any participant payroll deductions not
applied to the purchase of shares returned to the participant), (ii) prohibit
participants in the ESPP from increasing their payroll deductions from those
in effect on the date of this Agreement and (iii) terminate the ESPP effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(f) _Employee Plan Termination_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
take all actions that may be necessary or appropriate to terminate as of the
Closing Date: (i) each Employee Plan set forth in Section 7.03(f) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and (ii) if requested by Parent not later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, any Employee Plan that the
Company is authorized to unilaterally terminate without the consent of any
third party and without payment of any termination fees. All resolutions,
notices, participant communications or other documents issued, adopted
or executed in connection with the termination of such Employee Plans shall
be subject to Parents reasonable opportunity to review and comment.

 



58 (g) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06, nothing in this Section
7.03, express or implied, (i) is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto, including any Covered Employee or any former
Service Provider, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement, (ii) shall establish, or constitute an
amendment, termination or modification of, or an undertaking to amend,
establish, terminate or modify, any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, (iii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (or, following the Effective Time, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them or (iv) shall create any obligation on the part of
Parent or its Subsidiaries (or, following the Effective Time, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) to employ any Covered Employee for any period
following the Closing Date.

Section 7.04 _Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary shall use, and shall cause their Affiliates to use, their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters, including using (and
causing their Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to:
(i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments, (ii) provide to the Company
a list of the information and the assistance required from the Company for
Parent to prepare the Required Financial Information as promptly as
practicable (and in any event not later than 10 Specified Business Days) after
the date hereof; (iii) provide the Required Financial Information to the Debt
Financing Sources as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, (iv)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof substantially on the terms and conditions
contained in the Financing Commitments or, with respect to conditions relating
to funding, on other terms no less favorable to Parent or Merger Subsidiary,
which agreements shall be in effect no later than the Effective Time, (iv)
satisfy, or cause their Representatives to satisfy, on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their respective
Representatives in such definitive agreements to be satisfied by Parent,
Merger Subsidiary or their respective Representative, and (v) cause the Debt
Financing Parties and any other Persons providing Debt Financing to fund the
Debt Financing at or prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) Parent shall not agree to, or permit, any amendments or modifications to,
or any waivers under, the Financing Commitments without the prior written
consent of the Company if such amendments, modifications or waivers would
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing)
such that after giving effect to such amendment, the Parent would not have
sufficient funds under the amended Financing

 



59  Commitments, together with any cash on hand, to consummate the Merger, or
impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand the then existing
conditions precedent to funding of the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Effective Time, if such new or additional conditions or such expanded existing
conditions would reasonably be expected to (i) prevent or materially delay or
impair the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger or (ii) adversely
impact the ability of Parent or Merger Subsidiary to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Financing Commitments; provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary may amend the
Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof; _provided further_ that, without
derogating from any of the Companys other obligations under Section 6.08,
the Company shall have no obligation to comply with Section 6.08 of this
Agreement in connection with such amendments.

 

(c) In the event that Parent determines that any portion of the Debt Financing
will not be available in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the
Financing Commitments, (i) Parent shall promptly so notify the Company and
(ii) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to, alternative financing from alternative financial
institutions in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that includes conditions to funding not
materially less favorable to Parent than those in the Financing Commitments,
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in any
event no later than the Effective Time).

 

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledges and agrees that neither
the obtaining of the Debt Financing or any alternative financing, nor the
completion of any issuance of securities contemplated by the Debt Financing or
any alternative financing, is a condition to the Closing.

 

(e) Parent shall (i) promptly furnish the Company complete, correct and
executed copies of the Financing Commitments and any amendment, modification
or replacement of any Financing Commitments promptly upon their execution
(provided, that provisions in such fee letter(s) related to fees and pricing
may be redacted (none of which redacted provisions adversely affect the
availability of, or impose additional conditions on the availability of, the
Debt Financing at the closing)), (ii) give the Company prompt written notice
of any breach or threatened (in writing) breach by any party of any of the
Financing Commitments or the Financing Commitment of which Parent or Merger
Subsidiary becomes aware or any termination or threatened (in writing)
termination thereof, (iii) after the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication received from any Debt Financing Party, give the
Company prompt written notice of any material dispute or disagreement between
or among any parties to any Financing Commitment that would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach under the Financing Commitment, (iv) give the
Company prompt written notice if for any reason Parent or Merger Subsidiary
has determined in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Debt Financing on substantially the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Financing Commitments, (v) promptly furnish
any additional

 



60  information reasonably requested in writing by the Company relating to the
circumstances in clauses (i) through (iv) of this Section 7.04(e)) and (vi)
keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing).

any material respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) cooperate in all respects and consult
with each other in connection with filings, including by allowing the other
party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment on

Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iv) at a time when Parent would have
been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i),
this Agreement shall be deemed to have been terminated pursuant to Section
10.01(c)(i) for purposes of this Section 11.04) or by the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(d)(i), then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately
available funds $34,140,000 (the "Termination Fee"), in the case of a

Company fails promptly to pay any amount due to Parent pursuant to Section
11.04(b), it shall also pay any reasonable and documented costs and expenses
incurred by Parent or Merger Subsidiary in connection with a legal action to
enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against the Company for
such amount, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or
expense at the publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date

equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of Parent and Merger Subsidiary

suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement or failure to perform hereunder or other failure of the
Merger to be consummated (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise). If this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the
Company is obligated to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 11.04(b),

for monetary damages of any kind or nature or arising in any circumstance in
connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by

pursuant to Section 11.04(b) (together with any interest, costs and expenses

intentional (A) failure of the Company to perform a covenant set forth in
this Agreement or (B) breach by the Company of any representation and warranty
set forth in this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that only one

warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are

readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read that reference and such
representations and warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part
of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that the inclusion
of an item in either disclosure schedule as an exception thereto will not be
deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance, that such item is required to be
disclosed by this Agreement or that such item has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

 __(b) The parties hereto agree that any information contained in any part of

representations and warranties if the relevance of that information as an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties would be reasonably apparent to a person who has read that
information concurrently with such representations and warranties, without any
independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so
disclosed; _provided_ that in no event shall any information contained in any
part of any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document entitled "Risk
Factors" or containing a description or explanation of "Forward-Looking
Statements" or any other information that is similarly predictive, cautionary
or forward-looking in nature be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure
for purposes of) any representations and warranties of any party contained in
this Agreement; and _provided further_ that in no event shall any information
contained in any part of any Company SEC Document be deemed to be an exception
to (or a disclosure for purposes of) any representations and warranties of the
Company contained in Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.03, 4.05, 4.23, 4.24 and 4.25. __

 



71 Section 11.06 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section 7.02
and this Section 11.06, shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 7.02
and this Section 11.06, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer
any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Debt
Financing Parties are third party beneficiaries of Sections 11.03, 11.07,

 __(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations under this Agreement without the written consent of each other
party hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign
its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time
in part, (i) by written notice to the Company, to a wholly-owned direct or
indirect Subsidiary of Parent, in which event all references herein to Parent
or Merger Subsidiary, as applicable, shall be deemed references to such other
Subsidiary; _provided_ that any such assignment shall not materially impede
or delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impair the rights of
the Company under this Agreement or relieve Parent of any of its obligations
