one or more of their respective businesses, assets or rights or interests
therein (each of the actions in this clause (i), a " _Regulatory Requirement_
"); and

 

(ii) contest, defend and appeal any Proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, brought or threatened to be brought by any Person (including
any Governmental Authority) in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated,
lifted or terminated, any order of any

 



49  kind or nature that would prevent the consummation of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement from occurring prior to the End Date.

 

(e) Except as expressly provided for in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)_, all such
efforts pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ shall be unconditional and
shall not be qualified in any manner and no actions taken pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ shall be considered for purposes of determining whether
an Intervening Event has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur.
If any Regulatory Requirement agreed to by Parent and/or Purchaser requires
action by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their
businesses or assets, and such action would constitute a breach of this
Agreement, Parent and Purchaser hereby consent to the taking of such action by
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent required by such Regulatory
Requirement.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
(i) will Purchasers Affiliates or any other Person (other than Parent,
Purchaser, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries) be obligated to
propose, negotiate, effect or agree to, the sale, divestiture, license or
other disposition of any share capital or other equity or voting
interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or
businesses, or otherwise take any action that limits their freedom of action
with respect to, or their ability to retain any share capital or other equity
or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products
or businesses, or otherwise be obligated to subject itself to any Regulatory
Requirement, (ii) will the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries
subject itself or any other Person to any Regulatory Requirement without the
prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent Purchaser shall grant if
such Regulatory Requirement does not involve any Burdensome Condition), (iii)
will Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries be
obligated to subject itself to any Regulatory Requirement unless such
Regulatory Requirement is conditioned upon, and only effective as of, the
Closing or (iv) will anything in this Section 6.2 require Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person to become subject to any Burdensome Condition.

 

Section 6.3 _Access to Information_. (a) Subject to applicable Law, the

respective officers and employees to provide Purchaser and its
Representatives, and the Debt Financing Sources and their respective
Representatives, upon reasonable advance notice, (i) such access to the

Company and its Subsidiaries (so long as such access does not unreasonably
interfere with the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) as
Purchaser reasonably may request; (ii) monthly financial information of the
type set forth in the sample monthly financial report on Section 6.3 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, as and when finalized by the Companys management
and (iii) all documents that Purchaser reasonably may request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Purchaser, the Debt Financing Sources
or their respective Representatives shall have access to any books, records
and other information the disclosure of which (A) would, in the
Companys good faith opinion, result in the loss of attorney-client privilege
with respect to such books, records and other information; or (B) would
violate any obligation of the Company, that is in existence as of the date
hereof or comes into existence after the date hereof in the ordinary course
of business, to a third party with respect to confidentiality, if the Company
shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such
third party to such disclosure 

 



50  and to prevent such obligation to come into existence to the extent it comes
into existence after the date hereof. The parties will use their reasonable
best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances
in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective
Representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the other parties set forth herein.

 

(c) All information obtained pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall be
kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.4 _Solicitation_. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_ to the contrary (other than _Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 6.4(e)_), during the period beginning on the date hereof and
continuing until 11:59 p.m., Ottawa, Ontario time, on June 7, 2018 (the "
_Go-Shop Period End Time_"), the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, advisors,
Affiliates and other representatives (" _Representatives_ ") shall have the
right to directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit and encourage, whether
publicly or otherwise, Acquisition Proposals from any third party, including
by way of providing access to non-public information or Company Employees
pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreements;  _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) provide to Purchaser any non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries, and access to any Company
Employees, that is provided to any Person given such access and which was not
previously provided to Purchaser; and (ii) enter into and maintain discussions
or negotiations with respect to Acquisition Proposals with any third party or
otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any
inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or the making of any
Acquisition Proposal from any third party. Purchaser shall not, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates not to, take any action that such Person knows
will interfere with or prevent the participation of any Person, including any
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity
financing, in negotiations and discussions permitted by this _Section_ __ _
6.4(a)_.

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_, from and after the Go-Shop Period End
Time until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with  _Article_ __ _ VIII_, none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives shall, directly or
indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage, knowingly
facilitate or knowingly assist (including by way of providing or making
available information or providing access to its properties, books, records or
personnel) the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers that
constitute, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal
or continue or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto
or otherwise knowingly cooperate with or knowingly assist or participate in,
or knowingly facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions
or negotiations, or furnish or disclose to any Person (other than Purchaser
and its Representatives) any information in connection therewith; (ii) approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, an Acquisition
Proposal or enter into any merger agreement, amalgamation agreement,
arrangement agreement, plan of arrangement, letter of intent, term sheet,
agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or
share exchange agreement, option agreement or other

 



51  similar agreement providing for or relating to an Acquisition Proposal or
(iii) authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing. Subject to _Section_ __
_ 6.4(c)_, from and after the Go-Shop Period End Time (or, with respect to
an Excluded Party, after it ceases to be an Excluded Party), the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or
negotiation with any Persons conducted theretofore by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any Representatives with respect to any potential Acquisition
Proposals and, if not already so requested, request the prompt return,
destruction or erasure of all confidential information previously furnished to
any Persons or their Representatives during any solicitation, encouragement,
discussion or negotiation that occurred during the period from the six (6)
months prior to the date of this Agreement through the Go-Shop Period End Time
(or, with respect to an Excluded Party, through the time that it ceases to be
an Excluded Party).

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any standstill
agreement or similarly restrictive agreement between the Company and any
other Person, but subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)_, if at any time following
the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Requisite Vote, (i) the Company
receives a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from a third party not
solicited or obtained in violation of _Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)_ and (ii) the
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
financial advisors) that (x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (y) that the
failure to furnish information or enter into discussions or negotiations with
such person pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_ would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then, prior to obtaining the
Requisite Vote, the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal; provided, that (x)
the Company and its Representatives will not disclose any non-public
information to such Person without entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, and (y) the Company will promptly provide to Purchaser any non-
public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries, and access to
any Company Employees, provided to such other Person which was not previously
provided to Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
_Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)_ or this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_, if there is one or
more Excluded Parties following the Go-Shop Period End Time, the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives may continue to
engage in the activities described in _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)_ after the Go-
Shop Period End Time with respect to any such Excluded Party, including with
respect to any amended proposal submitted by any such Excluded Party, so long
as such Person or group of Persons continues to be an Excluded Party,
following the Go-Shop Period End Time until the earlier of the Cut-Off Time
and the time that such Excluded Party ceases to be an Excluded Party; provided
that the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives comply
in all material respects with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_.

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Purchaser in the event that the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
of its or their respective Representatives receives (i) an Acquisition
Proposal from a Person or group of related Persons (but prior to the Go-Shop
Period End Time only a written Acquisition Proposal); (ii) any request made
after the Go-Shop Period End Time by a Person or group of related Persons
other than an Excluded Party for information relating to any potential
Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) any

 



52  inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal made after the Go-Shop Period End Time by a Person or a group
of related Persons other than an Excluded Party. Any such notice required by
the preceding sentence shall include the identity of the Person or group of
Persons (other than, prior to the Go-Shop Period End Time, with respect to an
Excluded Party or any party that may become an Excluded Party) making such
proposal, request or inquiry and the material terms and conditions thereof
(and shall include a copy of any written proposal, inquiry or request,
which may, prior to the Go-Shop Period End Time, redact the identity of an
Excluded Party or any party that may become an Excluded Party). The Company
shall keep Purchaser informed on a prompt and current basis (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) as to the status and any material developments,
modifications, discussions and negotiations concerning the matters referred to
in the two preceding sentences that the Company is required to
notify Purchaser in respect of, including the material terms and conditions
thereof (and shall include a copy of any written modification or other
material documentation relating thereto, which may, prior to the Go-Shop
Period End Time, redact the identity of an Excluded Party or any party that
may become an Excluded Party). Without limiting the foregoing, after the Go-
Shop Period End Time, the Company shall notify Purchaser in writing promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) upon providing or making
available information or engaging in negotiations concerning an Acquisition
Proposal from a Person or group of related Persons pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.4(c)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_
__ _ 6.4_, the Company and its Representatives shall provide
confidential information only in compliance with the requirements of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)_ and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be
party to any agreement that prohibits the Company from providing or making
available to Purchaser any information provided or made available to any
other Person pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise
complying with this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_.

 

(e) Neither the Board nor any committee thereof shall directly or indirectly

publicly propose to modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Purchaser or
withdraw, the Recommendation, (ii) approve or make any recommendation to the
Company Shareholders in connection with any tender offer, take-over bid or
other Acquisition Proposal (other than a recommendation against such offer),

otherwise take any other action in connection with the Company Meeting or make
any other public statement inconsistent with such Recommendation, (iv) fail
to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of this Agreement within ten (10)
Business Days after Purchaser so reasonably requests in writing after a
material event or development (other than a take-over bid, tender offer or
exchange offer) (or within such fewer number of days as remains prior to the
day that is two (2) Business Days before the Company Meeting), provided __
that, Purchaser may not make such request prior to the Go-Shop Period End
Time, (v) in the case of a tender offer or exchange offer subject to
Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act, fail to recommend, in a
solicitation/recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, rejection of such
tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10) Business Days of the
commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer, or (vi) in the case of a
take-over bid or insider bid subject to National Instrument 62-104 \- Take-
Over Bids and Issuer Bids of the Canadian Securities Administrators, fail to
recommend, in a directors circular, rejection of such take-over bid or
insider bid within fifteen (15) days of the date of such take-over bid or
insider bid (any of the actions referred to in the foregoing clauses (i)
through (vi) taken by the Board or a committee thereof, a "
_Recommendation Withdrawal_ "); provided, that at any time prior to obtaining
the Requisite

 



53  Vote, if (A) either (1) the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which
the Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel
and financial advisors) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (2) the Board
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisors) there has been an Intervening Event and (B) the Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then the Board may (x) make a Recommendation Withdrawal or (y)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(ii)_ in order to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
provided, however, the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(ii)_ and any purported termination pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(ii)_ shall be void and of no force or effect, unless
the Company has complied with this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ (other than with
respect to any breach that is de minimis) and concurrently with such
termination the Company pays to Purchaser the Termination Fee payable pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ and substantially concurrently enters into a
definitive agreement providing for such Superior Proposal; and provided,
further, that the Board of Directors may not effect a Recommendation
Withdrawal pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4(e)_ or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(ii)_ unless:

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Purchaser, at
least four (4) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its
intention to effect a Recommendation Withdrawal or terminate this Agreement to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal,
which notice shall specify, as applicable: (A) the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, including the identity of the Person or group of Persons making
such Superior Proposal) and include all relevant transaction documents or (B)
the facts and circumstances in reasonable detail of the Intervening Event;

(ii) during the Notice Period (or such shorter period as is specified in
_Section_ __ _ 6.4(f)_ below), the Board and its Representatives have
negotiated in good faith with Purchaser (to the extent Purchaser desires to
negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement that may,
at Purchasers sole discretion, be proposed by Purchaser in response to such
Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable; and

 

(iii) at the end of the Notice Period (or such shorter period as is specified
in _Section_ __ _ 6.4(f)_ below), the Board (A) concludes in good faith
(after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) taking
into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Purchaser that is capable of acceptance, that, as applicable, (1)
the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal or (2) the
Intervening Event continues to warrant a Recommendation Withdrawal; and (B)
concludes in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

(f) In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Purchaser and to
comply with the requirements of _Section_ __ _ 6.4(e)_ with respect to such
new written notice, except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to two (2)
Business Days.

 



54 (g) The Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, enter into any confidentiality or other agreement subsequent to the date
hereof which prohibits the Company from complying with this _Section_ __ _
6.4_.

 

(h) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing a
position as required by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or
similar Laws under Canadian Securities Laws or (ii) making any disclosure to
the Company Shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board (after
consultation with outside counsel), the failure to make such disclosure would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _
6.4(h)_ shall be deemed to permit a Recommendation Withdrawal to be made
without complying with _Section_ __ _ 6.4(e)_. 

(i) Any breach by any Subsidiaries of the Company, or any directors, officers,
employees or Affiliates of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall be deemed a breach by the Company of this _Section_
__ _ 6.4_. Any material breach by any Representatives of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than any directors, officers, employees or
Affiliates of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) of this _Section_ __ _
6.4 _shall be deemed a breach by the Company of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_.

 

Section 6.5 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall and shall cause the
Company to, to the greatest extent permitted by Law, indemnify and hold
harmless (and comply with all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
obligations existing as of the date hereof to indemnify and hold harmless,
including obligations to advance funds for expenses) each Person who served or
serves as a former or present director, manager or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who served or serves as a director,
officer, manager, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each such Person, together with such
Persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Person_ "),
against any and all costs or expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (" _Damages_ "), incurred in connection with any Proceeding or
investigation with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Person
is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
is or was serving at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time. Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, use
reasonable best efforts to assist in the defense of such matter with the
Indemnified Person in the defense of any such Proceeding.

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, the Company shall have purchased, and, following
the Effective Time, Purchaser shall cause the Company to maintain, a tail
policy to the

 



55  current policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained on
the date hereof by the Company (the " _Current Policy_ "), which tail policy
shall be effective for a period from the Effective Time through and including
the date six (6) years after the Effective Date with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective
Time, and which tail policy shall contain substantially the same coverage and
amount as, and contain terms and conditions no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the coverage currently provided by the Current Policy;
provided, that the Company shall not be required to pay any amounts in
respect of such coverage prior to the Effective Time and provided, further
that the cost of such tail policy shall not exceed 300% of the Companys
current annual premium for its Current Policy (the " _Current Premium_ "), it
being understood that if the cost of such tail policy would exceed 300% of the
Current Premium then the Company shall purchase a tail policy that contains
the highest level of coverage that can be obtained for such amount. 

(c) This _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ shall survive the consummation of the
Arrangement and is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by each Indemnified Person (each of whom shall, for the avoidance
of doubt, be deemed third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement for purposes
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_) and shall be binding on Purchaser, the Company
and their successors and assigns. In the event that Purchaser or the Company,
as applicable, or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person
(including by dissolution), then, and in each such case, Purchaser shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
Purchaser or the Company, as applicable, assume and honor the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_.

 

(d) The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be
exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Person is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any insurance
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims
under any such policies.

Section 6.6  _Public Announcements_. The initial press release issued by
Purchaser and the Company concerning this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release, the contents of which have
received prior approval from both such parties, and thereafter, except with
respect to any press release or other public statement in connection with a
Recommendation Withdrawal or any action taken pursuant to and, in each case,
only to the extent permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 6.4(e)_, _Section_ __ _
6.4(h)_ or _Article_ __ _ VIII_), so long as this Agreement is in effect, the
parties will consult with each other in good faith before issuing any
press release or making any other public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any press
release or public statement as may be required by applicable Law, will not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
consent of the other parties (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); provided, that the restrictions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall not apply to any press release or other public
statement issued or made, or

 



56  proposed to be issued or made, that is consistent in all material respects
with previous press releases or public statements made by a party hereto in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_.

Section 6.7 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee employed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (" _Current
Employee_ ") may have under any Company Benefit Plan, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, for so long as a Current
Employee remains employed by Purchaser and its Subsidiaries during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof,
to maintain for such Current Employee (i) his or her salary or hourly wage
rate, commission structure and opportunities, and/or target cash bonus
opportunities that are each no less favorable, and (ii) all other
compensation and benefits, including severance, that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate, to those maintained for and provided to such
Current Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,
nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of any Company
Benefit Plans or interfere with Purchasers or Companys right or obligation
to make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable Law. Nothing
in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall limit the right of Purchaser, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Current Employee
at any time in a manner consistent with any applicable Law and any applicable
Company Benefit Plan.

(b) As of and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall, or shall cause
the Company to, give each Current Employee full credit for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit
accruals, except for purposes of vacation and severance) under any Employee
Benefit Plans and any other pension, supplemental pension, retirement,
employee compensation and incentive plans, benefit (including vacation) plans,
programs, policies and arrangements, in each case maintained for the benefit
of Current Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Purchaser, the
Company or its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Purchaser Plan_ ") for such Current
Employees service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their predecessor
entities prior to the Effective Time, to the same extent such service is
recognized as of immediately prior to the Effective Time by Purchaser, the
Company or its Subsidiaries under comparable Company Benefit Plans. With
respect to each Purchaser Plan that is a " _welfare benefit plan_ " (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and any other similar plan maintained in a
jurisdiction other than the United States, with respect to which a Current
Employee becomes eligible to participate for the first time after
the Effective Time and during the year in which the Effective Time occurs,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, where
applicable, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause there to be
waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations or exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements with respect to the Current Employees and their
eligible dependents and (ii) give effect, for the year in which the Effective
Time occurs, for purposes of satisfying any deductible and maximum out-of-
pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts
reimbursed to, Current Employees and their eligible dependents under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such Current Employees and their
eligible dependents participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, assume and honor, in accordance with their
respective terms,

 



57  (i) each existing employment, change in control, severance and termination
plan, policy or agreement of or between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any officer, director or employee of that
company, on the other hand, (ii) each bonus plan, program or agreement and
(iii) all obligations pursuant to existing compensation and benefit
arrangements of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of the Effective
Time, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), to the
extent legally binding on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_
that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not prohibit
Purchaser, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries from amending
or terminating any plan, policy, program, agreement, or arrangement referenced
in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) to the extent permitted by the
terms thereof.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ are for the sole benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to (i) confer upon or give to any person
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Employees), other than the
parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters
provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_) under or by reason of any provision
of this Agreement, (ii) establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, including any Company Benefit Plan or any
Purchaser Plan, (iii) alter or limit the ability of any of Purchaser, the
Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them or (iv) is
intended to confer upon any Company Employee any right to employment or
continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment.

Section 6.8 _Financing_.

 

(a) From and after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Article_ __ _
VIII_, the Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives, including legal and accounting, to provide all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole), including (i) participation, including participation by
management of the Company with appropriate seniority and expertise, on a
timely basis in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies; (ii) assisting Parent
and the Debt Financing Sources with the preparation of materials for rating
agency presentations, bank information memoranda, business projections,
marketing materials and similar documents required in connection with the
Debt Financing; (iii) executing and delivering any pledge and security
documents, guarantees, currency or interest rate hedging arrangements, other
definitive financing documents or other certificates, legal opinions
or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including a
certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company or any Subsidiary
with respect to solvency matters and consents of auditors for use of their
reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing) and otherwise
reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral (including obtaining third
party consents and estoppels); provided, that, in each case, any such
document, certificate, opinion or pledge shall be conditioned on Closing and
shall only be effective at or

 



58  after the Effective Time; (iv) furnishing Parent and the Debt Financing
Sources as promptly as practicable with all Required Information and as
promptly as practicable, informing Parent if the Company or its Subsidiaries
have actual knowledge of any facts that would be reasonably likely to require
the restatement of any financial statements comprising a portion of the
Required Information; (v) taking all actions reasonably necessary to (A)
permit the Debt Financing Sources to evaluate the Companys current assets,
cash management and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating
thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements and (B)
effective on or after the Effective Time, establish bank and other accounts
and blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with
the foregoing; (vi) taking all corporate actions, and other actions that
are reasonably requested by Parent and within the control of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, to satisfy any requirements necessary to consummate the Debt
Financing and the direct borrowing or incurrence of all of the proceeds of the
Debt Financing by Parent or the Company, as applicable; provided that the
corporate actions described in clause (vi) shall be conditioned on Closing and
shall only be effective on or after the Effective Time; (vii) promptly
furnishing to Parent and the Debt Financing Sources at least four (4)
Business Days prior the Effective Date with all documentation and other
information required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable "know-
your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
USA PATRIOT Act, relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, in each case
reasonably requested by Parent at least seven (7) Business Days prior to the
Effective Date; (viii) assisting Parent in connection with the preparation of
pro forma financial information and pro forma financial statements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries of the type required by the Debt Financing
Commitment or necessary or reasonably required by Debt Financing Sources to
be included in any customary marketing materials; provided that none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be required to
actually prepare any such pro forma financial information; and (ix) providing
customary authorization letters to the Debt Financing Sources authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders or investors and containing
customary representations that the public side versions of such documents do
not include material non-public information about the Company or its
Subsidiaries or their securities and the accuracy of the information contained
in the disclosure and the marketing materials. None of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay prior to the Effective Time any
commitment or other similar fee in connection with the Debt Financing that is
not promptly (within five (5) Business Days of delivery of documentation
evidencing such cost or expense) reimbursed by Parent. Parent shall on the
earlier of the Effective Date and the termination of this Agreement, upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all liabilities and Damages suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided by or on
behalf of the Company or the Subsidiaries), in each case, other than to the
extent any of the foregoing arises from the bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct of, or material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ by, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives (the
reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent set forth in this
sentence and in _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ are referred to, collectively, as the "
_Reimbursement Obligations_ "). The Company hereby consents to the use of its
and its Subsidiaries trademarks and logos in connection with the Debt
Financing, provided that such trademarks and logos are 

 



59  used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm
or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and its or their
trademarks or logos. All non-public or otherwise confidential information
regarding the Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.8(a)_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that (x) such information
may be shared on a confidential basis with any actual or prospective
Debt Financing Sources, their representatives and Affiliates in connection
with the Debt Financing and (y) Parent, its Representatives and the Debt
Financing Sources shall be permitted to disclose information as necessary and
consistent with customary practices in connection with the Debt Financing so
long as Parent and its Representatives reasonably cooperate with the Company
in order to permit the Company to comply with its obligations under applicable
Law relating to the disclosure of such confidential information.

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions in the Debt Financing Commitments at or prior to
the Effective Time, including (i) negotiating definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein or on other
terms, taken as a whole, no less favorable to Parent, (ii) satisfying on a
timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent in such definitive agreements
that are within its control and (iii) enforcing all of its rights under the
Debt Financing Commitments (or any definitive agreements with respect
thereto), including by filing one or more Proceedings against the Debt
Financing Sources to fully enforce the Debt Financing Sources obligations
under the Debt Financing Commitments. In the event any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Financing Commitments, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain alternative financing commitments from alternative sources on terms,
taken as a whole, no less favorable to Parent (as determined in the
reasonable judgment of Parent) as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_, the
term " _Debt Financing Commitments_ " shall be deemed to include any such
commitment with respect to an alternative financing to the extent such
commitment is then in effect and the term " _Debt Financing_ " shall be deemed
to include any alternative financing so obtained or arranged by Parent.
Parent shall keep the Company reasonably apprised of material developments
relating to the Debt Financing.

 

(c) Parent shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any
waivers of, any condition or other material provision under the Debt
Financing Commitments and Parent shall not agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other material
provision under the Equity Commitment Letters, in each case, without the
consent of the Company if such amendments, modifications or waivers would
impose any new or additional condition or otherwise amend, modify or waive any
of the conditions to the receipt of the applicable Financing, in each case in
a manner that would be reasonably likely to cause any material delay in the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII (it being understood
that Parent may, without the consent of the Company, amend, restate, modify,
supplement or replace the Debt Financing Commitments to add and appoint
additional arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters, agents, lenders and similar
entities and to provide for the assignment and reallocation of a portion of
the financing commitments).

 

(d) In no event shall Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (i) award any
investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory role on an
exclusive basis, or

 



60  (ii) engage any bank or investment bank or other provider of debt financing
on an exclusive basis (or otherwise on terms that would reasonably be expected
to prevent such provider from providing or seeking to provide financing to
any third party in connection with an Acquisition Proposal), in the case of
clauses (i) and (ii) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not restrict any arrangements
with Evercore Group L.L.C., BMO Capital Markets Corp., Credit Suisse
Securities (USA) LLC or TD Bank, N.A. (or any of their respective Affiliates)
as financial advisors but not, for the avoidance of doubt, exclusive
arrangements as debt financing sources. Until the Go-Shop Period End Time, and
after such time with respect to an Excluded Party, if any, until the time that
it ceases to be an Excluded Party, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall seek or obtain any equity commitments or equity financing in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, or provide any information in
respect thereof to any potential investor in Purchaser, or any of Purchasers
or any such investors financing sources or potential financing sources or
other Representatives who have not been provided any such information prior to
the date hereof. Purchaser shall cause its Affiliates to comply with the
foregoing covenant. In addition, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not cause
any of the portfolio companies affiliated with Searchlight Capital Partners,
L.P. that would, but for the provisos in the definition of "Affiliate",
be Affiliates of Purchaser, to take any of the actions prohibited by the
foregoing covenant.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or in the Confidentiality
Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser and its respective Affiliates may enter
into discussions, negotiations, arrangements or understandings with respect to
equity financing or equity financing commitments in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including confidentiality
and exclusivity agreements) with any Person that (y) is an Equity Financing
Source or a limited partner (or equivalent) of investment funds of Searchlight
Capital Partners, L.P. as of the date hereof (or an Affiliate thereof), or
(z) is set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.8(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
in each case of (y) and (z) and any advisor thereof; and provide information
in connection therewith, without any such Persons being required to execute a
joinder to the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise enter into a
confidentiality agreement.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Companys
breach of any of its covenants and agreements required to be performed by it
under _Section_ __ _ 6.8(a)_ will not be considered in determining the
satisfaction of the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ unless such breach
results in, or is a cause of, Parent being unable to obtain the proceeds of
the Debt Financing prior to or at the Closing.

Section 6.9 _Treatment of Company Credit Agreement_. The Company shall
deliver all notices in accordance with the terms of the Company Credit
Agreement and any related loan document, and take all other reasonable actions
to facilitate, and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver
to Purchaser no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Effective
Time a customary, executed payoff letter (the " _Payoff Letter_ ") with
respect to, (i) the satisfaction and release of all of the Company and
its Subsidiaries liabilities and obligations (including all Indebtedness for
borrowed money, if any, of the Company and its Subsidiaries outstanding as of
the Closing, but excluding any contingent indemnification obligations that are
not then due and payable and that by their terms are to survive the
termination of the Company Credit Agreement and the related loan documents and
any letters of credit or similar instruments that are cash collateralized on
the Effective Date in accordance with the terms of the Company

 



61  Credit Agreement and the related loan documents) under the Company Credit
Agreement and the related loan documents, (ii) the termination of the Company
Credit Agreement and all related loan documents and (iii) the release of all
Liens and guarantees related to the Company Credit Agreement and the related
loan documents; provided that (A) in no event shall this _Section_ __ _ 6.9
_require the Company to cause any such satisfaction, termination or release
other than at the Effective Time and (B) Purchaser shall provide, or cause to
be provided, all funds required to effect such repayment.

 

Section 6.10 _Confidentiality Agreement_. Purchaser acknowledges the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement, and the parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that this Agreement does not in any manner modify or limit the Companys
rights under such agreement other than as expressly specified in _Section_ __
_ 6.8(e)_; provided that Sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Confidentiality
Agreement are hereby terminated and of no force or effect. The Company shall
not amend or grant any waiver of any confidentiality or similar agreement,
other than any standstill obligation therein.

 

Section 6.11 _Management_. In no event shall Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, Representatives or investors in Purchaser enter into
any arrangements with any Company Employee that prohibits or restricts such
Company Employee from discussing, negotiating or entering into, any
arrangements with any third party in connection with an Acquisition Proposal
not otherwise in violation of  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_; provided, that this
_Section_ __ _ 6.11_ does not prohibit the entering into of any rollover
agreements approved by the Board. Purchaser shall cause its Affiliates,
Representatives and each investor in Purchaser to comply with the foregoing
covenant.

Section 6.12 _Company Plans_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
the Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board, as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and take all actions that are necessary to effectuate
the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement related to the
Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs. The Company shall take all
steps reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and
any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the
Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.13 _Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify Purchaser of any
Proceeding brought or threatened against the Company or its directors by or
on behalf of any holder of any Company Securities relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep Purchaser reasonably
and promptly informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall
give Purchaser the right to review and comment on all material filings or
responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such Proceeding
(and the Company shall in good faith take such comments into account) and the
opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of such Proceeding,
and the Company shall not agree to any such settlement without Purchasers
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



62 Section 6.14 _Reorganization_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser in planning, preparing and effectuating any
reorganization of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries corporate
structure, capital structure, business or operations, or transfer of
securities, assets or business, in each case, to be completed prior to the
Closing, as Purchaser may reasonably request or as may be necessary or
appropriate to complete the transactions contemplated hereby, including
amalgamations, liquidations, reorganizations or stock or asset transfers (each
a " _Reorganization Transaction_ "), and to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to implement any such Reorganization Transaction as Purchaser may
reasonably request; provided, however, that (i) such Reorganization
Transaction does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) such Reorganization Transaction is not,
in the opinion of the Company, acting reasonably, prejudicial to the holders
of Company Securities, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and does
not result in Taxes being imposed on, or any adverse Tax or other
consequences to, any holder of Company Securities, (iii) such Reorganization
Transaction shall not materially impede or delay, or prevent, the receipt of
any regulatory approvals, the satisfaction of any other conditions set forth
in _Article_ __ _ VII_, the ability of Purchaser to obtain the Financing or
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) such Reorganization
Transaction does not require the Company to obtain the approval of the
Company Shareholders (other than is obtained by virtue of the approval of the
Arrangement) and does not require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
obtain any consent of any third party if obtaining such consent would
reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (v) Purchaser shall pay all direct or
indirect costs and liabilities, fees, Damages, penalties and Taxes that may
be incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries as a consequence of the
implementation of or to unwind any such Reorganization Transaction if the
Arrangement is not completed, including actual out-of-pocket costs and
expenses for filing fees and expenses of external counsel and auditors which
may be incurred in connection with such Reorganization Transaction, (vi) no
such Reorganization Transaction or any action of the Company or its
Subsidiaries requested by the Purchaser in connection therewith shall be
considered to constitute a breach of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the Company hereunder or in determining whether
any of the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have
been satisfied, (vii) such Reorganization Transaction shall not be contrary to
applicable Laws or the organizational documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (excluding wholly owned Subsidiaries) and would not result in any
breach by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Contract or Permit and
(viii) such Reorganization Transaction shall not become effective unless
Purchaser has irrevocably waived or confirmed in writing the satisfaction of
all conditions in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ and shall have
confirmed in writing that it will, upon completion of the Reorganization
Transaction, promptly and without condition or delay proceed to effect the
Arrangement and (ix) such Reorganization Transaction is effected as close as
reasonably practicable to the Effective Time.

(b) Purchaser shall provide written notice to the Company of any proposed
Reorganization Transaction at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Effective Time. Upon receipt of such notice, Purchaser and the
Company shall, subject in all cases to _Section_ __ _ 6.14(a)_, work co-
operatively and use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare prior to the
Effective Time all documentation necessary and do all such other acts and
things as are 

 



63  reasonably necessary, including making amendments to this Agreement or the
Plan of Arrangement, to give effect to such Reorganization Transaction. No
Reorganization Transaction will be made effective unless (i) it is reasonably
certain, after consulting with the Company, that the Arrangement will become
effective, (ii) such Reorganization Transaction can be reversed or unwound
without materially adversely affecting the holders of Company Securities, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the event the Arrangement does not
become effective and this Agreement is terminated (after giving effect to any
reimbursement required by to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.14_), or (iii) the
Company otherwise consents to such Reorganization Transaction, acting
reasonably. The obligation of Purchaser to reimburse the Company for fees and
expenses and be responsible for costs as set out in this _Section_ __ _
6.14_ will be in addition to any other payment Purchaser may be obligated to
make hereunder and will survive termination of this Agreement. If the
Arrangement is not completed for any reason, and without prejudice to any
other remedy of the Company, Purchaser hereby indemnifies and holds harmless
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against all liabilities, losses, Damages, Taxes suffered or incurred by any
of them in connection with or as a result of any Reorganization Transaction,
or to reverse or unwind any Reorganization Transaction.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject in all cases
to _Section_ __ _ 6.14(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 6.14(b)_, the Company
acknowledges that Purchaser may enter into one or more transactions (the "
_Bump Transactions_ ") designed to step up the adjusted cost base of certain
non-depreciable capital property of the Company or its Subsidiaries for
purposes of the ITA, and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist Purchaser and to provide information reasonably required by Purchaser
in this regard on a timely basis and to assist in the obtaining of any such
information in order to facilitate a successful completion of the Bump
Transactions or any such other reorganizations or transactions as is
reasonably requested by Purchaser.

Section 6.15 _Parent_. Parent will cause Purchaser to comply with all of its
obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 6.16 _Certain French Subsidiaries_. Purchaser and the direct and
indirect equityholders of Purchaser intend to cause any Subsidiaries that are
organized in France to be directly or indirectly transferred to the
Subsidiaries of the direct and indirect equityholders of Purchaser that are
organized in France, and Purchaser and its direct and indirect equityholders
intend to effect this transfer immediately after the Closing, all in
accordance with, and for the purpose of applying, the provisions of section
223 B, c, of the French tax code (code general des impots). Nothing described
in this Section 6.16 will impede or delay, or prevent, the receipt of any
regulatory approvals, the satisfaction of any other conditions set forth in
Article VII, the ability of Purchaser to obtain the Financing or consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(other than the second sentence), _Section_ __ _ 3.5(b)_ (other than the

and as of the Closing as if made at and as of such time, except in the case of
this clause (iv) where the failure to be so true and correct, individually or
in the aggregate, would

the Company to consummate the Arrangement is subject to the satisfaction or
valid waiver of the following further conditions (which may be waived, in
whole or in part, with the written consent of the Company):

 

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. Each representation and warranty of
Purchaser and Parent contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct as

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, in each case,
that any representation and warranty made as of a specific date shall be
required to be so true and correct (subject to such qualifications) as of such
date only.

 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Purchaser_. Purchaser and Parent shall have
performed in all material respects all obligations, and complied in all
material respects with the agreements and covenants, required to be performed
by or complied with by them hereunder.

(c)  _Officer_ __ _s Certificate_. The Company shall have received a
certificate signed by a senior officer of Purchaser and Parent certifying as

time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any prior approval of the
Arrangement by the Company Shareholders):

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Purchaser;

 



66 (b) by either the Company or Purchaser, if:

 

(i) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on January 23, 2019 (the " _End Date_ ") unless the failure
of the Effective Time to occur by such time is the result of, or caused by,
the failure of the party seeking to exercise such termination right (with
respect to Purchaser, including Parent) to perform or observe any of the
covenants or agreements of such party (with respect to Purchaser, including
Parent) set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if as of
immediately prior to such time, all the conditions to Closing, other than
the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_, shall have been
satisfied or shall be capable of being satisfied, the End Date may be extended
by either Purchaser or the Company by written notice to the other party
to April 22, 2019, which date shall thereafter be deemed to be the End Date;

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_
shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to any party if their (with respect
to Purchaser, including Parents) breach of any provision of this Agreement is
the principal cause of or resulted in the application or imposition of such
Restraint; or

 

(iii) at the Company Meeting or any adjournment thereof at which the
Arrangement has been voted upon, the Company Shareholders and Company Warrant
Holder fail to approve the Arrangement in accordance with the Interim Order.

(c) by the Company:

 

(i) if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
part of Purchaser or Parent set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred
which would cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_
or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable
of being cured by the End Date or has not been cured prior to the 30th
(thirtieth) day after giving of written notice thereof by the Company to
Purchaser; provided, however, that the Company is not then in material breach
of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section_
__ _ 7.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ not to be satisfied;

 

(ii) prior to obtaining the Requisite Vote, in order to substantially
concurrently enter into a definitive acquisition agreement providing for a
Superior Proposal in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions
of, _Section_ __ _ 6.4(e)_; or

 

(iii) if (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing), (B) Purchaser
fails to consummate the Closing on the date required pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.7_, (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Purchaser in writing
that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing; and (D)

67 (d) by Purchaser, if:

under _Section_ __ _ 6.4_;

 

(ii) a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
part of the Company set forth in this Agreement (other than its obligations
under _Section_ __ _ 6.4_) shall have occurred which would cause any of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ not
to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured by the End Date
or has not been cured prior to the 30th (thirtieth) day after the giving of
written notice thereof by Purchaser to the Company; provided, however, that
neither Purchaser or Parent is then in material breach of this Agreement so as
to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ not to be satisfied; or 

(iii) (A) the Board or any committee thereof shall have effected a
Recommendation Withdrawal, or publicly proposed to effect a Recommendation

_Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(ii)_ or by Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(d)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(iii)_, then the Company shall pay the

Parent, at or prior to the time of termination in the case of a termination
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(ii)_ or within two (2) Business Days
following termination of this Agreement in the case of a termination pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(iii)_.

(b) In the event that (1) this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser or the
Company pursuant to (i) _ Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _
8.1(b)(iii)_ (or is terminated by the Company pursuant to a different section
of  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ at a time when this Agreement was terminable by
Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _
8.1(b)(iii)_), or (ii) is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(d)(ii)_ (or is terminated by the Company pursuant to a different section
of _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ at a time when this Agreement was terminable by
Purchaser pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(ii)_) and, (2) at any time
after the date hereof and prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal
shall have been publicly announced or publicly made known and not publicly
withdrawn (or, in the case of clause (ii), shall have been communicated or

months after such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent (or as directed by Parent)
(for purposes of the foregoing clauses (2) and (3), references to " _20%_ " in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "
_50%_ ").

 



68 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(iii)_, then Parent shall pay to the Company the
Purchaser Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days following such
termination by the Company.

 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser or the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(iii)_ (or is terminated by the Company
pursuant to a different section of _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ at a time when this
Agreement was terminable by Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(b)(iii)_), then the Company shall pay Parent (or as directed by Parent)
$7,500,000 (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ ") in respect of expenses incurred
by Parent, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby without need for
supporting documentation within two (2) Business Days following such
termination. Any Expense Reimbursement shall be credited against any
subsequently payable Termination Fee.

 

(e) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.2(d)_
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the party entitled to receive such payment.

 

(f) Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, neither
the Company, Parent nor Purchaser would have entered into this Agreement, and
that any amounts payable pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are not a
penalty. If the Company fails to pay as directed in writing by Parent any
amounts due to accounts designated by Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.2_ within the time periods specified in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ or Parent
fails to pay the Company any amounts due to the accounts designated by the
Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ within the time periods
specified in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, the Company or Parent, as
applicable, shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) incurred by Purchaser or Parent, on the one hand (which shall be
paid to Parent (or as directed by Parent)) or the Company, on the other hand,
as applicable, in connection with any action, including the filing of any
lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on
such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period
as published in The Wall Street Journal plus 5.0%, calculated on a daily basis
from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual
payment (the obligations in this sentence are referred to collectively as the
" _Enforcement Expenses_ ").

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but except as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ with respect to equitable remedies, the
Companys right to receive payment of a Purchaser Termination Fee and any
Enforcement Expenses from Parent pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.15_ or from the Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantee shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy available to the Company, its Affiliates and
its Subsidiaries against Parent, Purchaser, the Guarantors and any of their
respective former, current, or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents and
the Debt Financing Sources (collectively, the " _Purchaser Related Parties_
") with respect to this Agreement and any other Transaction Document and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including for any liabilities
and Damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Financing) to be consummated under any
theory or for any reason), and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Purchaser Related Parties

 



69  shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, any other Transaction Document and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (except that the applicable parties shall
also be obligated with respect to, and the applicable parties may be entitled
to remedies with respect to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Guarantee and
the Reimbursement Obligations).

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but except as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ with respect to equitable remedies and in
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_, Parents right to receive or direct payment of the
Termination Fee or the Expense Reimbursement in the circumstances in which it
is payable (and, in the case of the Expense Reimbursement, in the event that
the Termination Fee does not become payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.2(b)_) and any Enforcement Expenses from the Company pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to
Parent, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates for money damages against
the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current, or
future shareholders, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents (collectively,
the " _Company Related Parties_ ") with respect to this Agreement, any other
Transaction Document and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(including for any liabilities and Damages suffered as a result of the
failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated under any
theory or for any reason), and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any other Transaction Document
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

Section 8.3 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Company,
Purchaser or Parent, except that the Guarantee referred to in _Section_ __ _
4.8_, the Reimbursement Obligations and _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_, _Section_ __
_ 8.2_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and  _Article_ __ _ IX_ will survive the
termination hereof in accordance with their respective terms and the terms
hereof; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve the Company from
liabilities for Damages incurred or suffered by the Purchaser or Parent as a
result of any actual and intentional fraud or Willful and Material Breach by
the Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement to the extent of such Damages.

and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time, except for those covenants
and agreements contained herein and therein which by their terms apply in
whole or in part after the Effective Time and then only to such extent. For
the avoidance of doubt, _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ shall survive for six (6) years
from the Effective Time and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Persons
against Purchaser and the Company during such period. Each of Purchaser and
the Company acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, (a) no party makes, and has
not made, any representations or warranties relating to itself or its
businesses or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (b) no person has been authorized by any party to make any

Section 9.4 _Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of the Interim Order, the
Plan of Arrangement and applicable Laws, this Agreement and the Plan of
Arrangement may be amended by an instrument in writing signed by the parties
hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors
at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of
the Arrangement by the Company Shareholders; provided, however, that (a) after
approval of the Arrangement by the Company Shareholders, no amendment may be
made which under applicable Law requires the further approval of the Company
Shareholders without such further approval and (b) _ Section_ __ _ 8.2(g)_,
this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, _Section_ __ _ 9.7_,  _Section_ __ _ 9.10(d)_,
_Section_ __ _ 9.11(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.11(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.13_,

Section 9.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party hereto contained herein or
in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) subject to the requirements
of applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any such extension
or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert
any rights or remedies shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or
remedies.

 



72 Section 9.6 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, provided that no party may assign, delegate
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the consent of the other party hereto (and any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void and without effect), except that each of
Purchaser and Parent may assign all or any of its rights and obligations
hereunder (a) to any Affiliate thereof or (b) to any Financing Source
pursuant to the terms of the Debt Financing for purposes of creating a
security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of
the Debt Financing and, after the Effective Date, any such Financing Source
may exercise all of the rights and remedies of Purchaser or Parent, as
applicable (or its Affiliate, as applicable) hereunder in connection with the
enforcement of any security or exercise of any remedies to the extent
permitted under the Debt Financing; provided, however, that no such
assignment shall relieve Purchaser or Parent of any of its obligations
hereunder.

Section 9.7 _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement may be executed by facsimile signatures and in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This
Agreement shall become effective only when actually signed by each party
hereto and each such party has received counterparts hereof signed by the
other party hereto. No provision of this Agreement is intended to or shall
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder or with respect hereto, except (a) the Indemnified Persons are
express beneficiaries of and may enforce  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, (b) the
Purchaser Related Parties are express beneficiaries of and may enforce
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(g)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.13_, (c) the Company Related
Parties are express beneficiaries of and may enforce _Section_ __ _ 8.2(h)_
and _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ and (d) the Debt Financing Sources are express
beneficiaries of and may enforce _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, this _Section_ __ _
9.7_, _Section_ __ _ 9.10(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.11(c)_ and _Section_ __ _
9.11(d)_.

 

Section 9.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by virtue of any Law, or
due to any public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner so that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including to the extent
referred to herein, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Financing Commitments
and the Guarantee) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with
respect to its subject matter and supersedes all oral or written prior
agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject
matter. In entering into this Agreement no party is relying upon any promise,
statement or representation made by or on behalf of any party except as
expressly set forth herein. The parties expressly acknowledge that they have
requested that this Agreement and all ancillary and related documents thereto
be drafted in the English language only. _Les parties aux pr_ _e_ _sentes
reconnaissent avoir exig_ _e_ _que la pr_ _e_ _sente entente et tous
les documents qui y sont accessoires soient r_ _e_ _dig_ _e_ _s en anglais
seulement._

 



73 Section 9.10 _Remedies_. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this
Agreement or by applicable Law on such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, although
the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance and payment of the
Purchaser Termination Fee, under no circumstances shall the Company, directly
or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive: (i) both (A) a grant of
specific performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under
this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letters) or the Closing to occur or
other equitable relief, on the one hand, and (B) payment of any monetary
damages whatsoever and/or the payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee, the
Enforcement Expenses and the Reimbursement Obligations, on the other hand; or
(ii) both (A) payment of any monetary damages whatsoever, on the one hand, and
(B) payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee, the Enforcement Expenses and the
Reimbursement Obligations, on the other hand.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur, monetary
damages would be difficult to determine and would be an insufficient remedy
and no other adequate remedy would exist at law or in equity, in each case in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
(or threatened to be breached). It is accordingly agreed that in the event of
a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The
parties irrevocably waive any defenses based on adequacy of any other remedy,
whether at law or in equity, that might be asserted as a bar to the remedy of
specific performance of any of the terms or provisions hereof or injunctive
relief in any action brought therefor.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and subject in
all respects to this _Section_ __ _ 9.10(c)_, it is acknowledged and agreed
that Parent has an obligation hereunder to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded, including by exercising its rights under the Equity Commitment
Letters, and such obligation of Parent, and the right of the Company
to specific performance in connection with enforcing such obligation of
Parent (whether under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letters) and the
obligation of Purchaser and Parent to consummate the Closing, will be subject
to the requirements that (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __
_ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been and continue to be satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the
Closing); (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded in full at
the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing; (iii) Purchaser
and Parent fail to consummate the Closing on the date required pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_; and (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a
written notice to Purchaser that if specific performance is granted and the
Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such
actions that are required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to
occur, and Purchaser and Parent fail to complete the Closing within two (2)
Business Days after delivery of the Companys irrevocable written
confirmation. In no event will the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to
enforce specifically Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded or to complete the Arrangement if the Debt Financing would not be

determined by multiplying (A) the number of Shares subject to such Company
PSU at target as set forth in the applicable award agreement, by (B) in the

PSU granted in 2018, 117.11%.

Company in consideration for the right to receive a cash payment from the
Company at the time and in the manner set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 4.1(b)_
in an amount equal to the product of (A) the Purchase Price and (B) the total
number of Shares subject to such Cashed-Out RSU (and, for greater certainty,
the Company shall withhold any required withholding Taxes pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.5_), and each such Cashed-Out RSU shall immediately be
cancelled, and (ii) each Company RSU that is not a Cashed-Out RSU will be
deemed to be assigned and transferred to the Company in consideration for the
right to receive a cash payment from the Company at the time and in the manner
set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 4.1(b)_, but subject to the vesting conditions
of such Company RSU, in an aggregate amount equal to the product of (x) the

ARTICLE 4

PAYMENT 

4.1 Delivery of Cash

(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Depositary, for the benefit of each Company
Shareholder and the Company Warrant Holder, the cash, in United States
dollars, to which each such Company Shareholder and Company Warrant Holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(f)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.1(h)_, as
applicable, upon the transfer of the Shares or Company Warrants to Purchaser,
as applicable. Upon surrender by a Company Shareholder or the Company Warrant
Holder to the Depositary of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented one or more Shares or Company Warrants, together
with a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and any other
documents reasonably requested by Purchaser and the Depositary (or, if such
Shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry
through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such Shares on a
book-entry account statement, it being understood that any references herein
to " _certificates_ " shall be deemed to include references to book-entry
account statements relating to the ownership of Shares), the Holder of
such surrendered certificate(s) of Shares or Company Warrants shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary shall deliver to
such Company Shareholder or the Company Warrant Holder, as soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, by wire transfer or by a cheque issued by the
Depositary (or other form of immediately available funds) representing that
amount of cash which such Company Shareholder or the Company Warrant Holder
has the right to receive pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(f)_ or _Section_ __
_ 3.1(h)_, as applicable, less any amounts withheld pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 4.5_.

 

(b) The Company shall deliver (or cause one of its Subsidiaries to deliver) to
each Holder of Company Options, Company PSUs and Company RSUs, through the
Companys or one of its Subsidiarys payroll systems (or by such other means
as the Company may elect or as otherwise directed by the Purchaser including
with respect to the timing and manner of such 

 



B-8  delivery) that amount which such Holder of Company Options, Company PSUs
and/or Company RSUs has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.1(c)_,  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(d)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.1(e)_, as applicable,
less any amounts withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.5_, which (i) in the
case of Company Options, Company PSUs and Cashed-Out RSUs, shall occur as soon
as practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than the Company and its
Subsidiaries second regular payroll payment after the Effective Time) and (ii)
in the case of a Company RSU that is not a Cashed-Out RSU, shall occur within
15 Business Days after the date such Company RSU would have vested, subject to
the vesting conditions of such Company RSU, including the Holders continued
employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries through the applicable
vesting date, except as otherwise provided by the terms of such Company RSU
(and, for greater certainty, if such vesting conditions are not met,
such Holder shall forfeit the right to receive any payment in respect of such
Company RSU). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to
any Company Option, Company PSU, or Company RSU that constitutes nonqualified
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent that
payment at the time described in this _Section_ __ _ 4.1(b)_ would otherwise
cause the imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such
payment shall instead be made at the earliest time permitted under the terms
of the applicable Company Benefit Plan and applicable award agreement that
will not result in the imposition of such Tax or penalty.

 

(c) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 4.1_, each
certificate of Shares and Company Warrants shall be deemed at all times after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
a cash payment in the manner contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 4.1_, less
any amounts withheld pursuant to _Section4.5_. 

(d) In the event of the surrender of a certificate of Shares or Company
Warrants that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company under
the name of the Person surrendering such certificate, the amount of cash to
which the registered Holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ shall
be paid to such a transferee if such certificate is presented to the
Depositary and such certificate is duly endorsed or is accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes or any other Taxes required by reason of
such payments being made in a name other than the registered Holder have been
paid.

(e) Any portion of the amount deposited with the Depositary (including any
interest and other income resulting from any investment of the Depositary with
respect to such amount) that remains unclaimed by the Holders and other
eligible Persons in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ 4_ following 180
days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Company, and any
Holder who has not previously complied with this _Article_ __ _ 4_ shall
thereafter look only to the Company for, and, subject to  _Section_ __ _
4.4_, the Company shall remain liable for, payment of such Holders claim for
payment under this _Section_ __ _ 4.1_.

 

4.2 Distributions with respect to Unsurrendered Certificates

 

No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Holder of any unsurrendered certificate which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares that were transferred
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_. At the time of such surrender of any such

 



B-9  certificate, there shall be paid to the Holder of the certificates
representing Shares, without interest, the amount of cash to which such Holder
is entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.1_.

4.3 Lost Certificates

 

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Shares or Company Warrants that were
transferred or cancelled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ is lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, a cheque (or other
form of immediately available funds) for the cash amount, deliverable in
accordance with such Holders Letter of Transmittal. When authorizing such
payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Person
to whom cash is to be delivered shall, as a condition precedent to the payment
thereof, give a bond satisfactory to Purchaser and the Company and their
respective transfer agents in such sum as Purchaser and the Company may
direct or otherwise indemnify Purchaser and the Company in a manner
satisfactory to Purchaser and the Company against any claim that may be made
against Purchaser or the Company with respect to the certificate alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

4.4 Extinction of Rights

 

Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares or Company Warrants that were transferred or cancelled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_, and not deposited, with all other
instruments required by _Section_ __ _ 4.1_, on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim or
interest of any kind or nature as a Holder of Shares or Company Warrants or
for the receipt of cash. On such date, the cash to which the former Holder of
the certificate referred to in the preceding sentence was ultimately entitled
shall be deemed to have been surrendered for no consideration to Purchaser.
None of Purchaser or the Company shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

4.5 Withholding Rights

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of Purchaser,
the Company, the Depositary and any other Person that has any withholding
obligation with respect to any amount payable hereunder shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to
any Person hereunder such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to such payment under the ITA, the Code or any
provision of any federal, provincial, territorial, state, local or other Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid
to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid, provided
that such deducted or withheld amounts are timely remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Authority.

 



B-10 4.6 No Liens

 

Any exchange or transfer of securities pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement
shall be free and clear of any and all liens, charges, claims, encumbrances
or other claims of third parties of any kind.

4.7 Paramountcy

 

From and after the Effective Time: (a) this Plan of Arrangement shall take
precedence and priority over any and all Company Securities, including
Shares, Company Options, Company RSUs, Company PSUs and the Company Warrant,
issued or outstanding prior to the Effective Time; and (b) the rights and
obligations of the holders (registered or beneficial) Company Securities,
including Shares, Company Options, Company RSUs, Company PSUs and the Company
Warrant, the Purchaser and its affiliates, the Depositary and any transfer
agent or other depositary therefor in relation to this Plan of Arrangement
shall be solely as provided for in this Plan of Arrangement.

ARTICLE 5

 

RIGHTS OF DISSENT

5.1 Rights of Dissent

Holders of Shares as of the record date for the Company Meeting may exercise
rights of dissent with respect to such Shares pursuant to and in the manner
set forth in Section 190 of the CBCA as modified by the Interim Order and this
_Article_ __ _ 5_ (" _Dissent Rights_ ") in connection with the Arrangement;
provided that, notwithstanding Subsection 190(5) of the CBCA, the written
objection to the Arrangement Resolution referred to in Subsection 190(5) of
the CBCA must be received by the Company not later than 5:00 p.m. on the
second (2nd) Business Day preceding the Company Meeting. Holders of Shares who
duly exercise Dissent Rights and who:

 

(a) are ultimately determined to be entitled to be paid fair value for their
Shares shall: (i) be deemed to have transferred such Shares to Purchaser as
of the time stipulated in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(g)_; (ii) in respect of such
Shares be treated as not having participated in the transactions in Article 3
(other than _Section_ __ _ 3.1(g)_); (iii) be entitled to be paid, subject
to _Section_ __ _ 4.5_, the fair value of such Shares by the Purchaser, which
fair value shall be determined as of the close of business on the day before
the Arrangement Resolution was adopted at the Company Meeting; and (iv) not
be entitled to any other payment or consideration, including any payment that
would be payable under the Arrangement had such Holders not exercised their
Dissent Rights; or

 

(b) are ultimately determined not to be entitled, for any reason, to be paid
fair value for their Shares shall be deemed to have participated in the
Arrangement on the same basis and at the same time as non-Dissenting
Shareholders;

but in no case shall the Company, Purchaser, the Depositary or any other
Person be required to recognize such holders as holders of Shares after the
time stipulated in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(g)_, and the name of such holders of
Shares shall be deleted from the register of holders of Shares at the time

 



B-11  stipulated in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(g)_ and Purchaser shall be considered the
holder of 100% of the Shares immediately following the completion of the
transactions contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 3.1_. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no circumstances shall the Purchaser, the Company, the Depositary or
any other Person be required to recognize a Person exercising Dissent Rights:
(A) unless, as of the deadline for exercising Dissent Rights (as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 5.1_), such Person is the registered holder of those Shares in
respect of which such Dissent Rights are sought to be exercised, (B) if such
Person has voted or instructed a proxy holder to vote such Shares in favor of
the Arrangement Resolution, or (C) unless such Person has strictly complied
with the procedures for exercising Dissent Rights and does not withdraw such
dissent prior to the Effective Time. In addition to any other restrictions
under section 190 of the CBCA, none of the following shall be entitled to
exercise Dissent Rights: holders of Company Options, Company RSUs, Company
PSUs or the Company Warrant (in their capacity as holders of Company Options,
Company RSUs, Company PSUs or the Company Warrant, as applicable).
