knowledge, any other party thereto, is in breach or default (whether with or

provision of any Material Contract.

including all financial covenants, in all notes, indentures, bonds and
other instruments or agreements evidencing any Indebtedness, except where the

third party to any note, indenture, bond or other instrument or agreement, or
cause a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

5.18 _Insurance_. Schedule 5.18 contains a true, complete and
correct list (including the names and addresses of the insurers, the names of
the Persons if other than the Company to whom such insurance policies have
been issued, the expiration dates thereof, the annual premiums and payment
terms thereof, whether it is a "claims made" or an "occurrence" policy and a
brief identification of the nature of the policy) of all liability, property,
workers' compensation and other insurance policies currently in effect that
insure the property, assets or business of the Company or its employees (other
than self-obtained insurance policies by such employees). Each such insurance
policy is valid and binding and in full force and effect, all premiums due
thereunder have been paid and the Company has not received any notice of
cancellation or termination in respect of any such policy or
default thereunder. The Company believes such insurance policies, in light of
the nature of the Company's business, assets and properties, are in amounts
and have coverage that are reasonable and customary for Persons engaged in
such business and having such assets and properties. Neither the Company,
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, the Person to whom such policy has been
issued, has received notice that any insurer under any policy referred to in
this Section 5.18 is denying liability with respect to a claim thereunder or
defending under a reservation of rights clause. Within the last two (2) years
the Company has not filed for any claims exceeding $1,000,000 against any of
its insurance policies, exclusive of automobile and health insurance policies.
The Company has not received written notice from any of its insurance
carriers or brokers that any premiums will be materially increased in the
future, and does not have any reason to believe that any insurance coverage
listed on Schedule 5.18 will not be available in the future on substantially
the same terms as now in effect.

license, franchise, permit, order or approval or other similar
authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the Business, together
with the name of the Authority issuing the same (the " _Permits_ "). Except
as indicated on Schedule 5.19, such Permits are valid and in full force and
effect, and none of the Permits will, assuming the related third party
consents have been obtained or waived prior to the Closing Date, be terminated
or impaired or become terminable as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company has all Permits necessary to operate the Business.

domestic or foreign, other than where such violation would not have a
Material Adverse Effect, nor, to the Company's knowledge, except as disclosed

this Agreement or any of the Additional Agreements to which the Company is a
party or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby will cause any material item of Intellectual Property
Rights owned, licensed, used or held for use by the Company immediately prior
to the Closing to not be owned, licensed or available for use by the Company
on substantially the same terms and conditions immediately following the
Closing.

5.28 _Employee Benefits and Compensation_.

  



  

(a) Schedule 5.28 sets forth a true and complete list of each
"employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA),
bonus, deferred compensation, equity-based or non-equity-based incentive,
severance or other plan or written agreement relating to employee or director
benefits or employee or director compensation or fringe benefits, maintained
or contributed to by the Company at any time during the 7-calendar year
period immediately preceding the date hereof and/or with respect to which the
Company could incur or could have incurred any direct or indirect, fixed or
contingent liability (each a " _Plan_ " and collectively, the " _Plans_ ").
Each Plan is and has been maintained in substantial compliance with all
applicable laws, including but not limited to ERISA, and has been
administered and operated in all material respects in accordance with its
terms.

  



  

(b) Each Plan which is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning
of Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
event has occurred and no condition exists which could reasonably be expected
to result in the revocation of any such determination. No event which
constitutes a "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043(c) of ERISA) for
which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived by the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ") has occurred with
respect to any Plan. No Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA has been terminated
or is or has been the subject of termination proceedings pursuant to Title IV
of ERISA. Full payment has been made of all amounts which the Company was
required under the terms of the Plans to have paid as contributions to
such Plans on or prior to the date hereof (excluding any amounts not yet due)
and no Plan which is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA has
incurred an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section
302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

(c) Neither the Company nor to the knowledge of the Company, any
other "disqualified person" or "party in interest" (as defined in Section
4975(e)(2) of the Code and Section 3(14) of ERISA, respectively), has engaged
in any transaction in connection with any Plan that could reasonably be
expected to result in the imposition of a penalty pursuant to Section 502(i)
of ERISA, damages pursuant to Section 409 of ERISA or a tax pursuant to
Section 4975(a) of the Code. The Company has not maintained any Plan
(other than a Plan which is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code) which provides benefits with respect to current
or former employees or directors following their termination of service with
the Company (other than as required pursuant to COBRA). Each Plan subject to
the requirements of COBRA has been operated in substantial compliance
therewith.

  



  

(d) No individual will accrue or receive additional benefits,
service or accelerated rights to payment of benefits as a direct result of
the transactions contemplated hereby. No material liability, claim,
investigation, audit, action or litigation has been incurred, made, commenced
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, by or against any Plan or the
Company with respect to any Plan (other than for benefits payable in the
ordinary course and PBGC insurance premiums). No Plan or related trust owns
any securities in violation of Section 407 of ERISA. With respect to each
Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2)
of ERISA) as of the most recent actuarial valuation report prepared for each
such Plan, the aggregate present value of the accrued liabilities thereof
(determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
35) did not exceed the aggregate fair market value of the assets allocable
thereto.

  



  

(e) No Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA) and the Company has not been obligated to contribute to
any multiemployer plan. No material liability has been, or could reasonably be
expected to be, incurred under Title IV of ERISA (other than for PBGC
insurance premiums payable in the ordinary course) or Section 412(f) or (n) of
the Code, by the Company or any entity required to be aggregated with the
Company pursuant to Section 4001(b) of ERISA and/or Section 414 (b), (c), (m)
or (o) of the Code with respect to any "employee pension benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA).

  



  

(f) There is no unfunded non-tax-qualified Plan which provides a
pension or retirement benefit.

  



  

   

26

 



    



  

(g) The Company has not made any commitment to create or cause to
exist any employee benefit plan which is not listed on Schedule 5.28, or to
modify, change or terminate any Plan (other than as may be necessary for
compliance with applicable law).

  



  

(h) The Company does not have any plan, arrangement or agreement

indemnification is sought by any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party
shall be entitled, at the sole expense and liability of the Indemnifying
Parties, to exercise full control of the defense, compromise or settlement of
any Third-Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Parties, within a reasonable
time after the giving of an Indemnification Notice by the Indemnified Party
(but in any event within ten (10) days thereafter), shall (i) deliver a
written confirmation to such Indemnified Party that the indemnification
provisions of Section 11.1 are applicable to such action and the Indemnifying
Parties will indemnify such Indemnified Party in respect of such action
pursuant to the terms of Section 11.1 and, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, shall do so without asserting any challenge, defense, limitation on
the Indemnifying Parties' liability for Losses, counterclaim or offset, (ii)
notify such Indemnified Party in writing of the intention of the Indemnifying
Parties to assume the defense thereof, and (iii) retain legal counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of
such Third-Party Claim.

  



  

(c) If the Indemnifying Parties assume the defense of any such
Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.2(b), then the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties in any manner reasonably
requested in connection with the defense, and the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to be kept fully informed by the Indemnifying Parties and their
legal counsel with respect to the status of any legal proceedings, to the
extent not inconsistent with the preservation of attorney-client or work
product privilege. If the Indemnifying Parties so assume the defense of any
such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense,
compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of such Indemnified
Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Parties have agreed to pay such fees and
expenses, or (ii) the named parties to any such Third-Party Claim (including
any impleaded parties) include an Indemnified Party and an Indemnifying Party
and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by its counsel that there
may be a conflict of interest between such Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Parties in the conduct of the defense thereof, and in any such
case the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne
by the Indemnifying Parties.

  



  

   

46

 



    



  

(d) If the Indemnifying Parties elect to assume the defense of any
Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.2(b), the Indemnified Party shall
not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand arising from
such asserted liability unless the Indemnifying Parties withdraw from or fail
to vigorously prosecute the defense of such asserted liability, or unless a
judgment is entered against the Indemnified Party for such liability. If the
Indemnifying Parties do not elect to defend, or if, after commencing or
undertaking any such defense, the Indemnifying Parties fail to adequately
prosecute or withdraw such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at the Indemnifying
Parties' expense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Indemnifying
Parties shall not be entitled to control, but may participate in, and the
Indemnified Party (at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties) shall be
entitled to have sole control over, the defense or settlement of (x) that
part of any Third-Party Claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a
preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance against the
Indemnified Party, or (ii) to the extent such Third-Party Claim involves
criminal allegations against the Indemnified Party or (y) the entire Third-
Party Claim if such Third-Party Claim would impose liability on the part of
the Indemnified Party in an amount which is greater than the amount as to
which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement. In the event the Indemnified Party retains control of the Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will not settle the subject claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

(e) If the Indemnifying Parties undertake the defense of any such
Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.1 and propose to settle the same
prior to a final judgment thereon or to forgo appeal with respect thereto,
then the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Parties prompt written
notice thereof and the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to
participate in the settlement, assume or reassume the defense thereof or
prosecute such appeal, in each case at the Indemnifying Parties' expense. The
Indemnifying Parties shall not, without the prior written consent of such
Indemnified Party settle or compromise or consent to entry of any judgment
with respect to any such Third-Party Claim (i) in which any relief other than
the payment of money damages is or may be sought against such Indemnified
Party, (ii) in which such Third-Party Claim could be reasonably expected to
impose or create a monetary liability on the part of the Indemnified Party
(such as an increase in the Indemnified Party's income Tax) other than the
monetary claim of the third party in such Third-Party Claim being paid
pursuant to such settlement or judgment, or (iii) which does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant, person conducting
such investigation or initiating such hearing, plaintiff or petitioner to
such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability with respect to such
Third-Party Claim and all other actions (known or unknown) arising or which
might arise out of the same facts.

11.3 _Escrow of Escrow Shares by Stockholders_. The Company and the
Stockholders hereby authorize Purchaser to deliver the Escrow Shares into
escrow (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. For purposes
of this Article XI, the Escrow Shares are valued at $10.00 per share.

  



  

(a) _Escrow Shares. Payment of Dividends; Voting_. Any dividends,
interest payments, or other distributions of any kind made in respect of the
Escrow Shares will be delivered promptly to the Escrow Agent to be held in
escrow. The Stockholders shall be entitled to vote the Escrow Shares on any
matters to come before the stockholders of Purchaser while such shares are
being held in Escrow.

  



  

(b) _Distribution of Escrow Shares_. At the times provided for in
Section 11.3(d), the Escrow Shares and any paid or accrued dividends
thereon shall be released to the Stockholders' Representative for
distribution to the Stockholders. Purchaser will take such action as may be
necessary to cause such certificates to be issued in the names of the
appropriate persons. Certificates representing Escrow Shares so issued that
are subject to resale restrictions under applicable securities laws will bear
a legend to that effect. No fractional shares shall be released and delivered
from the Escrow Fund to the Stockholders' Representative and all
fractional shares shall be rounded to the nearest whole share.

  



  

(c) _Assignability_. No Escrow Shares or any beneficial interest
therein may be pledged, sold, assigned or transferred, including by operation
of law, by the Stockholders or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable
process in satisfaction of any debt or other liability of the Stockholders,
prior to the delivery to such Stockholders by the Stockholders' Representative
of the Escrow Shares by the Escrow Agent as provided herein.

  



  

(d) _Release from Escrow Fund_. Within five (5) business days
following expiration of the Survival Period (the " _Release Date_ "), the
remaining Escrow Shares will be released from escrow to the Stockholders'
Representative less the number or amount of Escrow Shares (at an assumed
value of $10.00 per Escrow Share) equal to the amount of any potential Losses
set forth in any Indemnification Notice from Purchaser with respect to any
pending but unresolved claim for indemnification. Prior to the Release Date,
the Stockholders' Representative shall issue to the Escrow Agent a
certificate executed by it instructing the Escrow Agent to release such
number of Escrow Shares determined in accordance with this Section 11.3(d).
Any Escrow Shares retained in escrow as a result of the immediately preceding
sentence shall be released to the Stockholders' Representative promptly upon
resolution of the related claim for indemnification in accordance with the
provisions of this Article XI.

  



  

11.4 _Periodic Payments_. Any indemnification required by Section
11.1 for costs, disbursements or expenses of any Indemnified Party in
connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Action
shall be made by periodic payments by the Indemnifying Parties to each
Indemnified Party during the course of the investigation or defense, as and
when bills are received or costs, disbursements or expenses are incurred and
in no event later than 45 days from the date of when bills are received.

  



  

   

48

 



    



  

11.5 _Intentionally Omitted_.

  



  

11.6 _Payment of Indemnification_. In the event that Purchaser is
entitled to any indemnification pursuant to this Article XI and Purchaser is
unable to set off such indemnification pursuant to Section 11.5, the
Stockholders shall jointly and severally pay the amount of the
indemnification (subject to the limitation set forth in Section 11.1) in
shares of Parent Common Stock at $10.00 per share. Any payments by the
Stockholders to a Purchaser Indemnitee will be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

  



  

11.7 _Insurance_. Any indemnification payments hereunder shall take
into account any insurance proceeds or other third party reimbursement
actually received.

  



  

11.8 _Survival of Indemnification Rights_. The representations and
warranties of the Company and the Stockholders shall survive until 18
months (the " _Survival Period_ ") following the Closing. The indemnification
to which any Indemnified Party is entitled from the Indemnifying Parties
pursuant to Section 11.1 for Losses shall be effective so long as it is
asserted prior to expiration of the Survival Period.

otherwise allocate such costs in such decision. Neither party shall be
entitled to special or punitive damages. The determination of the Arbitrator
shall be final and binding upon the parties and not subject to appeal.

  



  

(h) Any judgment upon any award rendered by the Arbitrator may be
entered in and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The

insolvency proceeding.

IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT EACH SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY

of the transactions contemplated hereunder has not occurred by September

14.2   _Amendments; No Waivers; Remedies_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement cannot be amended, except by a writing signed by
each party, and cannot be terminated orally or by course of conduct. No
provision hereof can be waived, except by a writing signed by the party
against whom such waiver is to be enforced, and any such waiver shall apply
only in the particular instance in which such waiver shall have been given.

  



  

(b) Neither any failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy
hereunder or in requiring satisfaction of any condition herein nor any
course of dealing shall constitute a waiver of or prevent any party from
enforcing any right or remedy or from requiring satisfaction of any
condition. No notice to or demand on a party shall waive or otherwise affect
any obligation of that party or impair any right of the party giving such
notice or making such demand, including any right to take any action without
notice or demand not otherwise required by this Agreement. No exercise of any
right or remedy with respect to a breach of this Agreement shall
preclude exercise of any other right or remedy, as appropriate to make the
aggrieved party whole with respect to such breach, or subsequent exercise of
any right or remedy with respect to any other breach.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no statement
herein of any right or remedy shall impair any other right or remedy
stated herein or that otherwise may be available.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, neither shall
any party seek, nor shall any party be liable for, punitive or exemplary
damages, under any tort, contract, equity, or other legal theory, with
respect to any breach (or alleged breach) of this Agreement or any provision
hereof or any matter otherwise relating hereto or arising in connection
herewith.

  



  

14.3 _Arm 's length bargaining; no presumption against drafter_.
This Agreement has been negotiated at arm's-length by parties of equal
bargaining strength, each represented by counsel or having had but declined
the opportunity to be represented by counsel and having participated in the
drafting of this Agreement. This Agreement creates no fiduciary or other
special relationship between the parties, and no such relationship otherwise
exists. No presumption in favor of or against any party in the construction
or interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof shall be made
based upon which Person might have drafted this Agreement or such provision.

  



  

14.4 _Publicity_. Except as required by law and except with respect
to the Parent SEC Documents, the parties agree that neither they nor their
agents shall issue any press release or make any other public disclosure
concerning the transactions contemplated hereunder without the prior approval
of the other party hereto. If a party is required to make such a disclosure as
required by law, the parties will use their best efforts to cause a mutually
agreeable release or public disclosure to be issued.

14.5 _Expenses_. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
unless otherwise specified herein.

  



  

14.6 _No Assignment or Delegation_. No party may assign any right
or delegate any obligation hereunder, including by merger,
consolidation, operation of law, or otherwise, without the written consent of
the other party. Any purported assignment or delegation without such consent
shall be void, in addition to constituting a material breach of this
Agreement.

  



  

14.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof.

  



  

14.8 _Counterparts; facsimile signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but
all of which shall constitute one agreement. This Agreement shall become
effective upon delivery to each party of an executed counterpart or the
earlier delivery to each party of original, photocopied, or electronically
transmitted signature pages that together (but need not individually) bear
the signatures of all other parties.

  



  

14.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the
Additional Agreements, sets forth the entire agreement of the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous understandings and agreements related thereto (whether
written or oral), all of which are merged herein. No provision of this
Agreement or any Additional Agreement may be explained or qualified by any
agreement, negotiations, understanding, discussion, conduct or course of
conduct or by any trade usage. Except as otherwise expressly stated herein or
any Additional Agreement, there is no condition precedent to the effectiveness
of any provision hereof or thereof. No party has relied on any representation
from, or warranty or agreement of, any person in entering into this
Agreement, prior hereto or contemporaneous herewith or any Additional
Agreement, except those expressly stated herein or therein.

  



  

14.10 _Severability_. A determination by a court or other legal
authority that any provision that is not of the essence of this Agreement is
legally invalid shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision hereof. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to substitute (or
cause such court or other legal authority to substitute) for any provision so
held to be invalid a valid provision, as alike in substance to such invalid
provision as is lawful.

  



  

14.11 _Construction of certain terms and references; captions_. In
this Agreement:

  



  

(a) References to particular sections and subsections, schedules,
and exhibits not otherwise specified are cross-references to sections and

54

 



    



  

(b) The words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder," and words of similar
import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision
of this Agreement, and, unless the context requires otherwise, "party" means
a party signatory hereto.

  



  

(c) Any use of the singular or plural, or the masculine, feminine,
or neuter gender, includes the others, unless the context otherwise requires;

generally accepted accounting principles as consistently applied
heretofore by the Company.

(including this Agreement), instrument, or other document includes all
schedules, exhibits, or other attachments referred to therein, and any
reference to a statute or other law includes any rule, regulation, ordinance,
or the like promulgated thereunder, in each case, as amended, restated,
supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time. Any reference to a
numbered schedule means the same-numbered section of the disclosure schedule.

  



  

(e) If any action is required to be taken or notice is required to
be given within a specified number of days following a specific date or
event, the day of such date or event is not counted in determining the last
day for such action or notice. If any action is required to be taken or
notice is required to be given on or before a particular day which is not a
Business Day, such action or notice shall be considered timely if it is taken
or given on or before the next Business Day.

  



  

(f) Captions are not a part of this Agreement, but are included for
convenience, only.

  



  

(g) For the avoidance of any doubt, all references in this Agreement

such documents and take such action, as may reasonably be considered
within the scope of such party's obligations hereunder, necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

14.13 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
provision hereof confers any benefit or right upon or may be enforced by any
Person not a signatory hereto.

  



  

14.14 _Waiver_. Reference is made to the final prospectus of the
Parent, dated August 8, 2017 (the " _Prospectus_ "). The Company has read the
Prospectus and understands that the Parent has established the Trust Account
for the benefit of the public stockholders of the Parent and the underwriters
of the IPO pursuant to the Trust Agreement and that, except for a portion of
the interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Parent may
disburse monies from the Trust Account only for the purposes set forth in the
Trust Agreement. For and in consideration of the Parent agreeing to enter into
this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees that it does not have any right,
title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account
and hereby agrees that it will not seek recourse against the Trust Account
for any claim it may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of,
any negotiations, contracts or agreements with the Purchaser.
