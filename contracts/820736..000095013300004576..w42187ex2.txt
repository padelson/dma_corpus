prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a good faith
estimate of the Net Working Capital of the Business as of the Closing Date
(the "ESTIMATED NET WORKING CAPITAL AMOUNT"), together with documentation to
support the numbers proposed. In the event that the Estimated Net Working
Capital Amount exceeds, or is less than, the Target Working Capital, then the
Purchase Price payable on the Closing Date shall be increased or reduced, as
applicable, by the amount the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount exceeds or
is less than the Target Working Capital.    - 5 -  11   3.5. POST-
CLOSING ADJUSTMENT.   (a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
Seller will prepare (with the assistance of its independent certified public
accountants if Seller so elects ("SELLER\'S AUDITORS")) and present to Buyer
a calculation of the Net Working Capital of the Business as of the Closing
Date (the "PROPOSED NET WORKING CAPITAL AMOUNT"), which shall be prepared
consistent with the Target Working Capital so that it presents fairly the Net
Working Capital of the Business as of the Closing Date using accounting
methods, practices and procedures as used in the preparation of the Target
Working Capital. Buyer and, if Buyer elects, a firm of independent certified
public accountants selected by Buyer (the "BUYER\'S AUDITORS"), shall be
given, together with the Proposed Net Working Capital Amount, the workpapers
and access to the books, records and personnel of Seller and, if applicable,
Seller\'s Auditors (the "WORKPAPERS"), utilized in preparing the Proposed Net
Working Capital Amount for purposes of verifying the accuracy thereof. The
Proposed Net Working Capital Amount shall be binding upon the parties to this
Agreement unless Buyer gives written notice of disagreement with any of the
values or amounts contained therein to Seller within thirty (30) days after
its receipt of the Proposed Net Working Capital Amount and the Workpapers
specifying in reasonable detail the nature and extent of such disagreement.
If Seller and Buyer mutually agree upon the Proposed Net Working Capital
Amount within thirty (30) days after Buyer\'s delivery of such notice of
disagreement, such agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto for
purposes of this Agreement. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve
any such disagreement within such period, the disagreement shall be referred
for final determination to Ernst and Young L.L.P. (the "FIRST CHOICE") or, if
such firm is not available, such other independent accounting firm of
national reputation selected by the mutual agreement of Seller and Buyer (the
"SELECTED FIRM") and the resolution of the disagreement by the First Choice
or the Selected Firm, as the case may be, shall be final and binding upon the
parties hereto for purposes of this Agreement. If Seller and Buyer cannot
agree on the Selected Firm, it shall be chosen by the First Choice and shall
be a nationally recognized firm other than any accounting firm that has
audited or been engaged to audit the financial statements of Buyer or Seller
within the two years preceding the date of this Agreement. The Proposed Net
Working Capital Amount as finally determined is referred to herein as the
"FINAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AMOUNT." The fees and disbursements, if any, of
Buyer\'s Auditors incurred in the preparation of the Proposed Net Working
Capital Calculation shall be paid by Buyer. Seller shall pay the fees and
disbursements, if any, of the Seller\'s Auditors. The fees and disbursements,
if any, of the First Choice or the Selected Firm, as the case may be, shall
be paid by Buyer and Seller, as the First Choice or the Selected Firm, as the
case may be, shall determine based upon its assessment of the relative merits
of the positions taken by each in any disagreement presented to such
firm.   (b) In the event the Final Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the
Estimated Working Capital Amount by more than $250,000, then within five
(5) business days after the final determination of the Final Net Working
Capital Amount, Buyer shall pay to Seller the difference between the Final
Net Working Capital Amount and the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount plus
the Retention (together with interest thereon at a rate of interest of three-
month LIBOR as in effect on the Closing Date from the Closing Date until the
date of such reimbursement) in immediately available funds by wire transfer
to a bank account designated in writing by Seller prior to the due date
thereof.   (c) In the event the Estimated Net Working Capital
Amount exceeds the Final Net Working Capital Amount by more than $250,000,
then within five (5) business days after the final determination of the Final
Net Working Capital Amount, (i) Seller shall pay to Buyer the difference
between the Estimated Working Capital Amount and the Final Net Working
Capital Amount and (ii) Buyer shall pay to Seller the Retention (in the case
of clauses (i) and (ii) above, together with interest thereon at a rate of
interest of three-month LIBOR as in effect on the Closing Date from the
Closing Date     - 6 -  12  until the date of such reimbursement), in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated in
writing by Buyer prior to the due date thereof.   3.6. PURCHASE PRICE
ALLOCATION.   (a) Buyer and Seller shall agree upon an allocation of
the Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets consistent with Section 1060 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder within 30 days after the
Closing Date. If Buyer and Seller cannot agree on any such allocation, such
dispute shall be resolved in accordance with SECTION 3.5(b). The allocation
required by this SECTION 3.6 shall be revised based on any adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to SECTION 3.6 within ten days after the final
determination of the Final Net Working Capital Amount. Each of Buyer and
Seller agrees to file Form 8594 as required by Section 1060 of the Code, and
all federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns, in accordance with any
such agreed allocation as adjusted as provided herein. Each of Buyer and
Seller shall report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for
federal Tax and all other Tax purposes in a manner consistent with any such
allocation determined pursuant to this SECTION 3.6. Each of Buyer and Seller
agrees to provide the other promptly with any information required to
complete the Form 8594. Buyer and Seller shall notify and provide the other
with reasonable assistance in the event of an examination, audit or other
proceeding regarding any allocation of the Purchase Price determined pursuant
to this SECTION 3.6. Buyer and Seller shall not take any position in any Tax
Return, Tax proceeding or audit that is inconsistent with such
allocation.   (b) In the event that a dispute arises between Seller and
Buyer as to any allocation of Purchase Price under SECTION 3.6(a), Buyer and
Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute. If such dispute
is not resolved within 30 days thereafter, Buyer and Seller shall submit the
dispute to the First Choice or the Selected Firm, as the case may be, for
resolution with each party presenting its position, which resolution shall be
final, conclusive and binding on Buyer and Seller. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the fees and expenses of the First Choice
or the Selected Firm, as the case may be, in resolving the dispute shall be
borne equally by Buyer and Seller.  4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

organizational document of Buyer or Parent, as amended to date, (b) result in
a breach of any of the provisions of, or constitute a default under any
material contract to which Buyer or Parent is bound, or (c) result in a

thereto or with respect to any related matter. Nothing contained in this
SECTION 5.8 will be construed as a waiver of or defense to claims for fraud.

COVENANTS OF SELLER PENDING CLOSING   6.1. CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.   Except
as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, during the period from the date
hereof through the Closing Date, Seller will conduct the operations of the
Business in the ordinary and usual course, consistent with past and current
practices, to keep the Business and the Purchased Assets substantially
intact, including its present operations, physical facilities, working
conditions, and relationships with lessors, licensors, suppliers, customers
and employees, all to the extent the officers, directors and management
employees of Seller reasonably determine such actions to be in the best
interests (including the future prospects) of the Business. Seller
shall maintain in full force and effect all     - 20 -  26  existing
casualty, liability and other insurance through the day following the Closing
Date in amounts not less than those in effect on the date hereof, except for
changes in such insurance that are made in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice.   6.2. FORBEARANCES.   Except as
contemplated by this Agreement or consented to by Buyer in writing (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), with respect to the Business
during the period from the date hereof through the Closing Date Seller shall
not engage in any practice, take any action, or enter into any transaction
outside of the ordinary course of business. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Seller will not (i) take any action, or enter into any
transaction with respect to the Purchased Assets or Assumed
Liabilities outside the ordinary course of business, the primary purpose or
effect of which is to generate or preserve cash, (ii) otherwise engage in any
practice, take any action or enter into any transaction which would cause the
representations set forth in SECTION 4.7 to be untrue on the Closing Date; or
(iii) take any action or fail to take any action that would cause any of the
other representations, warranties or covenants contained herein to be untrue
or incorrect or incapable of being performed or satisfied on the Closing
Date.   6.3. UPDATES.   Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of the
occurrence after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date of
any fact or condition that would, as of the time of such occurrence,
constitute a breach of any representation or warranty had such representation
or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact
or condition.  7. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS   7.1. ACCESS AND
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.   Seller shall afford to Buyer and its
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours beginning on
the date hereof to the books, records, offices, Contracts, officers,
employees, consultants and contractors of the Business and to such other
information relating to the Business as Buyer shall reasonably request. If
the Closing shall not occur, Buyer shall return to Seller all written
material containing or reflecting any such information, and Buyer shall not
retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part of
such written material and shall destroy all documents, memoranda, notes and
other writings (or portions of any such writings, if applicable) prepared by
Buyer or any of its advisors based on such information and upon written
request provide a certification to Seller that such destruction has occurred.
All information furnished or to be furnished by Seller or its agents to Buyer
shall be kept confidential (notwithstanding any termination of
this Agreement); provided, however, that such confidentiality obligation
shall not apply to (a) disclosure to the extent necessary to meet the
requirements of Applicable Law (subject to giving Seller notice as promptly
as possible of the intention to make such disclosure and providing Seller the
opportunity to seek a protective order), or (b) any information which (i) was
already in Buyer\'s possession from a source other than Seller and without an
obligation of confidentiality prior to the disclosure thereof by Seller or
its agents, (ii) was generally known to the public prior to the disclosure
thereof, (iii) became known to the public through no fault of Buyer, or (iv)
was disclosed to Buyer by a third party not known by Buyer to be bound by an
obligation of confidentiality.     - 21 -  27   7.2. CONSENTS;
SATISFACTION OF CLOSING CONDITIONS.   (a) Prior to Closing. Except as
provided in SECTION 7.3(b), Seller shall use all reasonable efforts to
obtain, with the cooperation of the Buyer, prior to Closing, all consents,
waivers and other approvals which shall be required in order to effectuate
the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, those
consents set forth in SCHEDULE 4.3 and 4.4. Seller and Buyer shall use all
reasonable efforts to satisfy promptly the conditions to the Closing
specified in this Agreement. Seller and Buyer shall furnish to each other and
to each other\'s counsel all such information as may be reasonably required
in order to effectuate the foregoing actions.   (b) Hart-Scott Rodino and
Exon-Florio Filings. As promptly as practicable following the execution of
this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall file with the CFIUS pursuant to the
Exon-Florio Provision all requisite documents and notifications, if any,
which are required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and Seller and Buyer shall complete any filing required
pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the "HSR ACT"), or shall mutually agree that no such filing is
required. Buyer shall be responsible for all filing fees owing to any
Governmental Authority in connection with filings contemplated by this
SECTION 7.2(b). Seller and Buyer shall diligently take, or fully cooperate in
the taking of, all necessary and proper steps, and provide any
additional information reasonably requested in order to comply with, the
requirements under the Exon-Florio Provision and the HSR Act.   (c)
Subsequent to Closing. From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall
cooperate with Buyer to obtain any consents, waivers and other approvals
which shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing Date. In the event
Seller is unable to obtain as of the Closing any consent, waiver or approval
that is required in order to transfer or assign any Purchased
Asset, including any Contract included in the Purchased Assets, the parties
shall enter into such mutually acceptable arrangement as is necessary to
provide Buyer with the benefits thereof and, with respect to any such
Contracts, Buyer shall pay and perform all obligations of Seller thereunder
after the Closing Date.   7.3. ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACTS AND RIGHTS.   (a)
Noncontravention. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Contract or
any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an
attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of a third party thereto,
would constitute a breach or other contravention thereof, be ineffective with
respect to any party thereto or in any way adversely affect the rights of
Buyer or Seller thereunder.   (b) Government Contract Assignments and
Novations. With respect to any Government Contract and any claim, right or
benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, Seller and Buyer will use
reasonable good faith efforts to obtain as expeditiously as possible, if
required, the written consent of the other parties to such Government
Contract for the assignment or, if required, novation thereof to Buyer or,
alternatively, written confirmation from such parties reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to Buyer and Seller that such consent is not required.
In furtherance of the foregoing, (i) with respect to the Prime Government
Contracts to which Seller is a party, as soon as practicable following the
Closing, Buyer and Seller shall submit to the relevant Responsible
Contracting Officer a written request that the relevant
Governmental Authority enter into a Government Contract Novation with Buyer
with respect to such Prime Government Contracts; and (ii) with respect to
each Government Contract that is not a Prime Government Contract, Buyer and
Seller shall, as soon as practicable     - 22 -  28  following the
date hereof, submit to the other party or parties thereto documentation
seeking the written waiver or approval of such other contracting party or
parties thereto to the transfer and assignment of all of Seller\'s claims,
rights, benefits and liabilities thereunder to Buyer. In this regard, Seller
and Buyer shall take all actions required or customary under any
FAR provision (or applicable equivalent regulation).   (c) Buyer
Responsibility. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
failure by the parties to obtain any required Government Contract Novation,
or any similar consent, waiver, confirmation, novation or approval with
respect to any Government Contract, shall not relieve either party from its
obligation to consummate at the Closing the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that (i) a substantial portion of
the Government Contracts will require the consent or, in the case of
Prime Government Contracts, Government Contract Novation, of the other party
or parties thereto by virtue of the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) with
respect to any Bids submitted by Seller before the Closing, the responsible
contracting office might not, after the Closing, award a contract to Buyer
based on such Bid until such responsible contracting officer determines that
Buyer, as a result of its purchase of the Business, is Seller\'s successor in
interest to such Bid. Buyer agrees and acknowledges that it shall be the
obligation of Buyer (and not Seller) to obtain the consents and
authorizations described in this SECTION 7.3(c). Seller will, however, use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining such
consents.   (d) Subcontract and Other Arrangements. If any
Government Contract Novation or any consent, waiver, confirmation, novation
or approval described in this SECTION 7.3 is not obtained with respect to any
Contract, then Seller and Buyer will cooperate to establish an arrangement
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller under which Buyer would obtain,
to the extent practicable, the claims, rights and benefits and assume the
corresponding liabilities and obligations thereunder in accordance with this
Agreement (including by means of any subcontracting, sublicensing or
subleasing arrangement) or under which Seller would enforce for the benefit
of Buyer, with Buyer assuming and agreeing to pay Seller\'s obligations, any
and all claims, rights and benefits of Seller against a third party
thereto.   7.4. LETTERS OF CREDIT; SURETY BONDS.   On or prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that Seller and its Affiliates are released from all obligations under
all letters of credit, surety and performance bonds, guarantees and other
financial support arrangements relating to the Business that either (a) are
set forth in SCHEDULE 7.4 or (b) are provided or otherwise become effective
after the date of this Agreement and not in contravention of the terms of
this Agreement (the "LETTERS OF CREDIT"). If Buyer is unable to obtain any
such release from any such arrangement by the Closing, at and after the
Closing Date, Buyer and Seller will continue to use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that Seller and its Affiliates are released from such
arrangements. In the event such release is not obtained within 90 days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide replacement irrevocable letters of
credit from a bank reasonably acceptable to Seller (and Parent shall
guarantee such letters of credit, if necessary) and containing terms and
conditions reasonably acceptable to Seller pursuant to which
the beneficiaries thereof are indemnified against all of their
respective obligations under any such arrangement from which such beneficiary
is not so released on the Closing Date.     - 23 -  29   7.5.
EMPLOYMENT; EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.   (a) Existing Employees. Prior to the
Closing, Buyer shall extend an offer of employment to each Existing Employee
for a comparable position at the same salary or hourly wage as in effect with
respect to such employee on the Closing Date. (For purposes of this
Agreement, any such Existing Employee who accepts an offer of employment is
referred to as a "TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEE.") Subject to the other provisions of
this SECTION 7.5, the Transferred Employees shall be employed after the
Closing in accordance with, and subject to, Buyer\'s usual terms, conditions
and policies of employment.   (b) Transferred Employee Benefit Plans.  
(i) Except as otherwise set forth in this SECTION 7.5(b), immediately
following the Closing Date, the Transferred Employees, during such time as
their employment with Buyer is continued, shall be eligible to participate in
Buyer\'s employee benefit plans ("BUYER BENEFIT PLANS") on the same terms and
conditions as similarly situated employees of Buyer are eligible to
participate therein. Specifically, Buyer shall make available to each of
the full-time Transferred Employees (i) life, accidental death and
dismemberment, long-term disability and short-term disability insurance
benefit plans to become effective on the Closing Date and (ii) medical,
dental and vision insurance benefit plans to become effective not later than
December 31, 2000. Buyer shall cause the Buyer Benefit Plans to recognize
prior service of Transferred Employees under corresponding Seller\'s benefit
plans prior to the Closing as service with Buyer and its Affiliates for
purposes of (i) any Buyer Benefit Plan that is not a Pension Plan for
purposes of any waiting period and eligibility requirements and (ii) any
Buyer Benefit Plan that is a Pension Plan, for purposes of eligibility
(including eligibility for early retirement benefits) and vesting (but not
benefit accrual) thereunder. Seller shall continue to provide benefit
coverage to all Transferred Employees under Seller\'s benefit plans until the
Closing. Buyer shall assume the liabilities specifically reflected on the
Interim Balance Sheet that are attributable to the Transferred Employees.
Except as otherwise set forth in this SECTION 7.5(b), Buyer shall assume all
liabilities, responsibilities and obligations under the Buyer Benefit Plans
with respect to the Transferred Employees for the provision of any benefits
otherwise available under such plans, including, without
limitation, comprehensive health, dental or drug welfare benefits otherwise
payable with respect to any covered health, dental, and/or covered services
and/or materials and/or supplies and/or expenses, which were provided to or
are incurred after the Closing.   (ii) Seller shall provide continued
health and medical coverage to the extent required under Section 4980B of the
Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or any other applicable federal, state or
local law or ordinance ("COBRA COVERAGE") to all Transferred Employees
(including their eligible dependents and beneficiaries) with respect to whom
a "qualifying event" (as such term is defined under Sections 4980B(f)(3) of
the Code or 603 of ERISA) or other triggering event described under the
applicable federal, state or local laws or ordinances occurs on or before the
Closing; provided that Buyer shall pay Seller all premiums in respect of
COBRA Coverage for the Transferred Employees as such premiums become due. In
addition to such premiums, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for (i) any
claims paid by Seller under Seller\'s dental or medical benefit plans to
Transferred Employees for claims incurred by Transferred Employees (including
their eligible dependents and beneficiaries) during the period beginning on
the Closing Date and ending on and including the last day of the calendar
month in which the Closing occurs and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses
associated with Seller\'s provision of COBRA Coverage to the Transferred
Employees (including their eligible dependents and beneficiaries) for the
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on December 31,
2000.     - 24 -  30   (c) Other Buyer and Seller Responsibilities.
Seller agrees that on and after the Closing, Buyer shall assume no liability,
obligation or commitment with respect to Seller\'s benefit plan or any
benefits or other amounts payable or provided under any Seller\'s benefit
plan or any notice (including, but not limited to, notice required by the
WARN Act (except with respect to Transferred Employees or COBRA)), or any
Contract relating to employment or termination of employment between Seller
and any of its employees or former employees, including the Transferred
Employees, except with respect to any contracts arising between Buyer and any
Transferred Employee. Buyer agrees that on and after the Closing, Seller
shall assume no liability, obligation or commitment with respect to any
benefit plan of Buyer or any benefits or other amounts payable or provided
under any Buyer\'s benefit plan or any contract relating to employment or
termination of employment between Buyer and any of its Affiliates and any of
their employees or former employees, including the Transferred Employees.  
(d) Further Assurances. Seller and Buyer shall take such further action
(before, at or after the Closing Date), if any, as reasonably may be
necessary or convenient to implement the intent of their agreements
contained in this SECTION 7.5. Seller shall make available to Buyer such
information as Buyer may reasonably request to enable Buyer to determine such
matters relating to employment and salary histories for purposes of the Buyer
Benefit Plans.   (e) No Third Party Beneficiary. No provision of this
SECTION 7.5 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee
or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) in
respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matters
and no provision of this SECTION 7.5 shall create any such rights in any such
persons in respect of any benefit plan or arrangement.   (f) Retention
Plans. Set forth on SCHEDULE 7.5(f) is a description of Seller\'s employee
retention plans (the "RETENTION PLANS"). Effective upon the Closing, Buyer
shall assume and continue to maintain the Retention Plans for those employees
of Seller (and former employees of Seller) covered thereby at the Closing
Date who are Existing Employees and pay all amounts to which any such
individuals may become entitled thereunder after the Closing Date.   (g)
401(k) Plan. As soon as administratively practicable after the Closing Date,
Seller shall cause the trustee of Seller\'s 401(k) plan to transfer to the
trustee of Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan, in a trustee-to-trustee transfer, cash,
securities, outstanding loan balances, or a combination thereof equal to the
account balances of all Transferred Employees. Buyer shall cause the trustee
of its 401(k) plan to accept the transfer from the trustee of Seller\'s
401(k) plan, and Buyer shall credit the accounts for the
Transferred Employees under its 401(k) Plan with the amounts on a fully
vested basis, if any, transferred on their behalf. The transfers required by
this SECTION 7.5(g) shall comply with Section 414(l) of the Internal Revenue
Code and the requirements of ERISA and the regulations promulgated
thereunder.   (h) Spending Accounts. This Section shall apply if Buyer
shall maintain a plan or plans under Section 125 and Section 129 of the
Internal Revenue Code in which Transferred Employees are eligible to
participate during the 2000 calendar year ("BUYER\'S SECTION 125 PLAN") and
such Transferred Employees also participated in the corresponding plans of
the Seller (the "SELLER\'S SECTION 125 PLAN") during the 2000 calendar year.
At the end of the 2000 year, the following adjustments shall be made between
Buyer and Seller:   (i) If the aggregate amount contributed by
Transferred Employees for 2000 to the Transferred Employees\' spending
accounts under Seller\'s Section 125 Plan exceeds the aggregate claims paid
by Seller for 2000 with respect to the Transferred Employees\' spending
accounts, Seller shall     - 25 -  31  pay Buyer an amount in cash
equal to such excess to the extent that the aggregate amount contributed by
Transferred employees for 2000 to their spending accounts under Buyer\'s
Section 125 Plan is less than the aggregate claims paid by Buyer for 2000
with respect to the Transferred Employees\' spending accounts.   (ii) If the
aggregate amount contributed by Transferred Employees for 2000 to their
spending accounts under Seller\'s Section 125 Plan is less than the aggregate
claims paid by Seller for 2000 with respect to the Transferred Employees\'
spending accounts, Buyer shall pay Seller an amount in cash equal to such
deficit, to the extent that the aggregate amount contributed by Transferred
Employees for 2000 to the Transferred Employees\' spending accounts under
Buyer\'s Section 125 Plan exceeds the aggregate claims paid by Buyer for 2000
with respect to the Transferred Employees\' spending accounts.   (iii) The
foregoing payments shall be made as soon as practicable after all claims have
been paid for the 2000 year.   7.6. TAX RETURNS.   (a) Seller Returns
Prior to Closing. Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file all
Tax Returns and pay all Taxes with respect to Taxes constituting Excluded
Liabilities for all taxable periods beginning on or prior to the Closing Date
and ending on or after the Closing Date when such Tax Returns or Taxes are
due, even though such Tax Returns or Taxes are not due until after the
Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner
consistent with prior returns.   (b) Cooperation After Closing. After the
Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall, as may be reasonably requested by
Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand:   (i) assist the
other party in preparing any Tax Returns or reports which such other party or
parties is or are responsible for preparing and filing with respect to the
Business;   (ii) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or any
disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of or
including the Business; and   (iii) retain and make available to the other
party and to any taxing authority all information, records and documents
reasonably requested relating to Taxes of the Business.   7.7. LIABILITY
FOR TRANSFER TAXES.   Buyer shall be responsible for the timely payment of,
and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against, all
sales (including, without limitation, bulk sales), use, value added,
documentary, stamp, gross receipts, registration, transfer, conveyance,
excise, recording, license and other similar Taxes and fees ("TRANSFER
TAXES") arising out of or in connection with or attributable to the
transactions affected pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall prepare and
timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed in respect of Transfer
Taxes. Buyer\'s preparation of any such Tax Returns shall be subject to
Seller\'s approval, which approval shall not be withheld unreasonably. Seller
shall file all required sales tax notifications as promptly as practicable
following the date hereof and shall provide to Buyer copies of any such
filings. Seller and Buyer shall use all reasonable efforts to minimize the
amount of all Transfer Taxes and cooperate in providing each other with
the information necessary to prepare and review such Tax Returns.     -
26 -  32   7.8. ORBITAL NAME.   Within 90 days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall remove all references to the names "Orbital Sciences Corporation"
and "Orbital" or any derivation of a name, mark, trade name or trademark
incorporating such names or any derivation therefrom or any corporate symbols
or logos incorporating such names either alone or in combinations

mail addresses, domain name services, datalinks or other property used by the
Business, other than internal workpapers, drawings, memoranda or similar
property that is not released to third parties in the ordinary course. During
the 180 day period following the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall clearly
identify to third parties after the Closing that the Purchased Assets and the
Business are owned and operated by Buyer.   7.9. POST CLOSING RECEIPTS;
COOPERATION.   (a) Administration of Accounts. If at any time following
the Closing, Seller or Buyer receives, or comes into possession of, any of
the Purchased Assets or Excluded Assets or any receipts, proceeds,
checks, securities or other property of any kind comprising, arising out of
or derived from the Purchased Assets or the Business or Excluded Assets
(including any check, notes or cash in payment of any account receivable or
other intangible constituting part of the Purchased Assets or Excluded
Assets), Seller or Buyer, as applicable, shall immediately deliver the same
to the appropriate party, with such endorsements, transfers or assignments as
may be necessary or desirable to ensure that such party receives the
immediate and full benefit thereof.   (b) Shared Assets. Without limiting
the definition of the Purchased Assets or Buyer\'s rights to the Purchased
Assets hereunder, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to resolve
any disputes as to whether any specific assets owned by Seller, other than
the Purchased Assets, that relate to the Business and another business of
Seller are used in or relate to the Business. Further, without limiting the
foregoing, with respect to any asset presently used in connection with the
Business that is also used by Seller in connection with a business of Seller
other than the Business, (i) the parties shall cooperate in good faith to
determine which business predominantly uses such asset, (ii) if appropriate,
the parties shall agree to transfer title to that asset to the party that
owns the business that predominantly uses such asset, (iii) without limiting
Seller\'s continued use, if appropriate, the parties shall otherwise
coordinate the nonexclusive use of the asset by Buyer, and (iv) with respect
to any proprietary Know-How and Intellectual Property (other than the
Excluded Assets) used by Seller in the Business but not included in the
Purchased Assets, Seller hereby grants Buyer a nonexclusive
perpetual, nonassignable (other than to Smiths Industries plc or subsidiaries
thereof) royalty-free license to use such Know-How and Intellectual Property
on an as is basis. With respect to any Contract applicable to both the
Business and such other business of Seller, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate
to structure contractual arrangements to such agreement providing both Seller
and Buyer with appropriate rights and obligations for shared use. Such
contractual arrangements may take the form of a subcontract, sublicense or
two separate agreements.   (c) Audits. Following the Closing Date, Seller
and Buyer shall cooperate reasonably with each other in connection with any
audit or review by any Governmental Authority or other party with respect to
the Business. Upon reasonable request, at the expense of the party requesting
assistance, each party will make available appropriate personnel and provide
pertinent records to enable the other party to assist in any such audit or
review.     - 27 -  33   (d) Other Cooperation. The parties shall
cooperate from and after the Closing Date, and take all reasonable steps to
provide for a smooth and orderly transition of the Business to Buyer,
including, without limitation, the transition of the employees, payroll,
management information systems, e-mail, computer systems, customers and
Contracts, and other assets.   7.10. BOOKS AND RECORDS.   On or prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall provide copies of the books, records and files
of Seller retained by Seller and described in SECTION 1.3(h). Following the
Closing Date, Seller shall make such records available to Buyer as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer for purposes of compliance with Applicable
Laws; provided, however, that Seller shall not be liable to Buyer in the
event of any destruction of such records unless Seller fails to maintain such
records with the same degree of care with which Seller maintains other
similar records.   7.11. NONCOMPETITION.   (a) Nonsolicitation. Seller
agrees that it will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, at any time
during the period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment or retention of, in any capacity, any
Transferred Employee; provided that this covenant shall not apply to the
general advertisement of employment opportunities. Buyer and Parent agree
that they will not, and will cause their subsidiaries not to, at any time
during the period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment or retention of, in any capacity, any
employee of Seller; provided that this covenant shall not apply to the
general advertisement of employment opportunities.   (b) Noncompetition.
Seller will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, for a period of
three (3) years following the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, engage in
the design or production of sophisticated electronics, avionics and mission
management systems for use in military aircraft, helicopters and land
vehicles of the type currently designed or produced in or by the Business (a
"COMPETING BUSINESS"); provided that this SECTION 7.11 shall not (i) prevent
Seller or any of any of its subsidiaries from engaging in any activities that
Seller or any of its subsidiaries is engaged in outside of the Business
immediately before the Closing Date, (ii) prohibit the acquisition (by merger
or otherwise) of the securities or assets of a business where the gross
revenues of such business attributable to a Competing Business constitute
less than twenty percent (20%) of the total gross revenue of such business or
(iii) prevent MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. from engaging in any
business.   (c) Enforceability. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree
that in view of the nature of the Business and the business objectives of
Buyer and Seller in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
