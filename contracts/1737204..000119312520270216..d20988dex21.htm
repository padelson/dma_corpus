LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Seller_ "), and, solely

RECITALS:

 

WHEREAS, as of the Execution Date (as defined herein), the Seller directly
owns all of the outstanding Equity Interests (other than the Target Equity
Awards (as defined herein and which are Equity Interest Equivalents under
which no Class B Units have been delivered) to be cancelled upon the Closing
(as defined herein)) of Blue Mountain Midstream LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the " _Target_ " and such Equity Interests, the "
_Interests_ ").

WHEREAS, the Target, together with the other Target Companies (as defined
herein), own and operate the Business (as defined herein).

WHEREAS, the Buyer desires to purchase, and the Seller desires to sell to the
Buyer, the Interests (as defined herein) for the consideration set forth

AGREEMENT:

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound, the Parties agree, and solely for purposes of _Section_ __ _
11.16_, Parent agrees, as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

1.1  _Certain Defined Terms_. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement that
are not defined in the text of the body of this Agreement shall have the
respective meanings given such terms as set forth in _Schedule_ __ _ A_
attached to this Agreement, and _Schedule_ __ _ A_ is incorporated herein by
reference with the same force and effect as if set forth herein in full.

 

ARTICLE II

THE TRANSACTION

2.1 _Purchase and Sale of Interests_. Subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Seller shall sell,
transfer, assign and deliver to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase and
acquire from the Seller, the Interests free and clear of all Liens, except for
Permitted Equity Encumbrances. The Interests to be acquired by the Buyer at
the Closing shall constitute all of the outstanding Equity Interests in the
Target.

   

2.2 _Deposit_.

 

(a) On the Execution Date, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Parties, the Buyer, the Seller and the Escrow Agent
shall enter into the Escrow Agreement. No later than the first (1st) Business
Day after the Execution Date, the Buyer shall deposit an amount equal to
$11,100,000 (together with any and all interest accrued thereon, the "
_Deposit_ ") via wire transfer of immediately available funds in to the
Deposit Escrow Account to be held in escrow and disbursed by the Escrow Agent
only in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between the terms of this
Agreement and those of the Escrow Agreement, as between the Buyer and the
Seller, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

 

(b) If the Closing occurs, the entirety of the Deposit shall be disbursed to
the Seller in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing, then the Deposit shall
be retained or disbursed as provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.2_.

2.3 _Purchase Price_.

 

(a) The unadjusted purchase price to be delivered by the Buyer to the Seller
for the sale, transfer, assignment and delivery of the Interests shall be
$111,000,000 (including the Deposit) (the " _Unadjusted Purchase Price_ "),
which is payable in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, subject to
adjustment pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ (as so adjusted, the " _Adjusted
Purchase Price_ "), and subject to allocation in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 2.5_.

 

(b) At the Closing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be paid in the
following manner:

 

(i) an amount equal to $700,000 (the " _Indemnity Escrow Fund_ ") shall be
deposited by the Buyer with the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in to the Indemnity Escrow Account to be held in escrow and
disbursed by the Escrow Agent only in accordance with the express terms of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

 

(ii) the Escrow Agent shall disburse from the Deposit Escrow Account to the
Seller an amount equal to the Deposit in accordance with the joint release
instructions to the Escrow Agent provided by the Seller and the Buyer pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(ii)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(iv)_, respectively;

 

(iii) the Buyer shall pay the Payoff Amounts to the payees under the Debt
Payoff Letters in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(ii)_; and

(iv) the Buyer shall pay to the Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated in writing by the
Seller to the Buyer at Closing, an amount equal to (A) the Unadjusted Purchase
Price (net of the Deposit), _minus_ (B) the Indemnity Escrow Fund and _plus_
(C) the Estimated Adjustment Amount (which shall result in a reduction of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price if the Estimated Adjustment Amount is a negative
number), in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_ (such resulting sum,
the " _Closing Amount_ ").

 



2

    

2.4 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 

(a) The Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer, at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date and at the sole expense of the
Seller, a written preliminary settlement statement substantially in the form
attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit D_ (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_
") setting forth in reasonable detail the Sellers good faith calculation of
the Adjusted Purchase Price (including with respect to the components
thereof), and the Adjustment Amount (such estimated amount, the " _Estimated
Adjustment Amount_ "), together with applicable wiring instructions. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Estimated Closing Statement shall include an estimate,
with reasonably detailed calculations, of the Measurement Time Working Capital
(the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "). The Estimated Closing Statement and
the determinations contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Within two (2) Business Days after the Buyers receipt of the
draft Estimated Closing Statement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_,
the Buyer will deliver to the Seller a written report containing all changes
that the Buyer proposes to the Estimated Closing Statement, if any, together
with an explanation of such changes. On or before the date that is two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Parties shall meet and discuss in
good faith any proposed changes to the Estimated Closing Statement and
attempt in good faith to agree upon the calculation of the Adjusted Purchase
Price. The Estimated Closing Statement, as agreed upon in writing by the
Parties, shall control for purposes of the Closing Amount; _provided_ , that
if the Buyer and the Seller do not agree in writing upon any or all of the
adjustments set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, then the amount of
such disputed adjustment or adjustments used to calculate the Closing Amount
shall be that amount set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement with respect
to such disputed adjustment or adjustments delivered by the Seller to the
Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date (and, in any
event, within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date), the Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to the Seller, at the sole expense of the Buyer, a closing
statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the proposed final
calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price (including with respect to the
components thereof) and the Adjustment Amount and reasonable supporting
documentation relating to such estimates. During the period between the
Closing Date and the delivery of the Post-Closing Statement, the Seller and
its Representatives shall cooperate in good faith with the Buyer and its
Representatives and provide any additional data and information as the Buyer
may reasonably request to prepare the Post-Closing Statement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Post-Closing Statement shall include the proposed
final calculation, with reasonably detailed calculations, of the Measurement
Time Working Capital (the " _Closing Working Capital_ "). The Post-Closing
Statement shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Accounting
Principles and otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and
the Buyer shall not make any changes to the assumptions underlying the
Accounting Principles, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by the
Parties. From and after the delivery of the Post-Closing Statement until the
Adjustment Amount is finally determined hereunder, the Buyer and its
Representatives shall cooperate in good faith with the Seller and its
Representatives and provide any additional data and information as the Seller
may reasonably request to verify the amounts reflected on the Post-Closing
Statement. Not later than the thirtieth (30th) day following receipt of the
Post-Closing Statement under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_, the Seller may
deliver to the Buyer a written notice (an " _Adjustment Notice_ ") containing
any changes the Seller proposes to the Post-Closing Statement. 

 



3

    

 Such Adjustment Notice will describe the nature and amount of any such
disagreement in reasonable detail and shall be accompanied by such supporting
documentation as is available to the Seller. If the Seller does not deliver
to the Buyer an Adjustment Notice within such thirty (30) day period, then the
Seller will be deemed to have irrevocably accepted and agreed to all items in
the Post-Closing Statement.

 

(c) If an Adjustment Notice is timely delivered to the Buyer in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_, then the Buyer and the Seller shall undertake
to agree on the final Adjusted Purchase Price no later than fifteen (15) days
after the date on which the Seller delivered such Adjustment Notice to the
Buyer. If the final Adjusted Purchase Price is mutually agreed upon in
writing by the Parties during such fifteen (15) day period, then the final
Adjusted Purchase Price as so agreed will be considered conclusive and binding
on the Seller and the Buyer.

 

(d) In the event that the final Adjusted Purchase Price is not mutually agreed
upon by the Parties during the fifteen (15) day period referenced in
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_, then Grant Thornton LLP (the " _Accounting Firm_ ")
will be jointly engaged by the Seller and the Buyer to resolve any
disagreements with respect to the components of the final Adjusted Purchase
Price (the " _Unresolved Objections_ "). If such accounting firm does not
agree to serve as the Accounting Firm within ten (10) days after written
request from the Seller and the Buyer to serve, then the Seller and the Buyer
will mutually select and engage an alternative internationally-recognized
independent accounting firm. If the Seller and the Buyer are unable to agree
within ten (10) days upon such firm or such firm declines to serve as the
Accounting Firm, then the Buyer and the Seller shall request that the American
Arbitration Association (Houston, Texas office) select an internationally-
recognized independent accounting firm to serve as the Accounting Firm for
resolution of the Unresolved Objections. In connection with the engagement of
the Accounting Firm, the Seller and the Buyer will execute such engagement,
indemnity and other agreements as the Accounting Firm may reasonably require
as a condition to such engagement. As promptly as practicable, but in any
event within thirty (30) days after the selection of the Accounting Firm and
execution of such engagement, indemnity or other agreements and based solely
on (i) a written submission provided by each of the Buyer and the Seller to
the Accounting Firm within ten (10) days following the Accounting Firms
selection (and without independent investigation on the part of the Accounting
Firm) and (ii) the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Accounting
Firm will determine whether the Post-Closing Statement requires adjustment in
accordance with the Accounting Principles and the terms of this Agreement.
Once appointed, the Accounting Firm shall have no ex parte communications
with any of the Parties concerning the expert determination or the underlying
dispute and shall only have communications with the Seller and/or the Buyer as
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)_. All communications between the
Seller and/or the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Accounting Firm, on the
other hand, shall be conducted in writing, with copies sent simultaneously to
the Seller and the Buyer, as applicable, or at a meeting involving both the
Seller and the Buyer where both the Seller and the Buyer have been provided at
least five (5) Business Days advance notice. The Accounting Firm shall be
authorized to determine the Unresolved Objections by only selecting
the components of the final Adjusted Purchase Price as proposed by the Seller
(on the one hand) or by the Buyer (on the other hand), whichever is more
accurate. In resolving the Unresolved Objections, the Accounting Firm will
function as an expert and not an arbitrator. The Seller and the Buyer will
each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case to the
Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and of any
enforcement of the determination of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the
Seller and the

 



4

    

 Buyer in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by
the Accounting Firm. The proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an
aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute
and shall be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination
of such firm is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. The
determination of the Accounting Firm with respect to such dispute, including
any allocation of fees, will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties,
absent manifest error. The date on which the final Adjusted Purchase Price is
finally determined in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ is referred
to as the " _Determination Date_."

(e) The Adjustment Amount, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 2.4_, shall be referred to herein as the " _Final Adjustment Amount_ ".
Within five (5) Business Days after the Determination Date, the Seller or the
Buyer, as applicable, shall make a true-up payment to the other in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(e)_, so that, after giving effect to such
payment, the Seller and the Buyer are in the same position they would
have been in had payments at the Closing been based on the finally determined
Adjusted Purchase Price (without any interest on such true-up payment) as
follows:

 

(i) If the Final Adjustment Amount is _greater_ than the Estimated Adjustment
Amount, then the Buyer shall promptly (but no later than five (5) Business
Days after the Determination Date) tender payment to the Seller, in cash by
wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the amount, in
dollars, by which the Final Adjustment Amount is  _greater_ than the
Estimated Adjustment Amount; or

(ii) If the Final Adjustment Amount is _less_ than the Estimated Adjustment
Amount, then the Seller shall promptly (but no later than five (5) Business
Days after the Determination Date) tender payment to the Buyer, in cash by
wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the amount,
in dollars, by which the Final Adjustment Amount is _less_ than the Estimated
Adjustment Amount.

2.5 _Tax Treatment_. 

(a) The Parties agree to treat the sale and purchase of the Interests pursuant
to this Agreement for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax
purposes (but for avoidance of doubt, not for Transfer Tax purposes) as a sale
by the Seller to the Buyer, and a purchase by the Buyer, of the Assets.

 

(b) The Parties agree that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and
applicable state and local Tax purposes), the Tax Consideration shall be
allocated among the Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ").
Within ninety (90) days after the Determination Date, the Buyer shall deliver
to the Seller a draft of the Allocation Schedule. Such draft Allocation
Schedule shall be deemed final, conclusive and binding (a " _Final Allocation
Schedule_ ") on the Parties unless the Seller delivers a written objection to
the Buyer within thirty (30) days after the Sellers receipt of the draft
Allocation Schedule. If the Seller objects in writing within such 30-day
period, the Parties shall use their good faith efforts to agree on a Final
Allocation Schedule for thirty (30) days after the Buyers receipt of such
objections. If the Parties cannot agree on the Allocation Schedule prior to
the end of such thirty (30)-day period, then each Party shall be entitled to
adopt its own position

 



5

    

 regarding the Allocation Schedule. In the event that the Parties agree (or
are deemed to agree) on a Final Allocation Schedule, the Seller and the Buyer
shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to): (i) be bound by the
Final Allocation Schedule agreed upon (or deemed to be agreed upon) under this
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_; (ii) use their good faith efforts to update the
agreed Final Allocation Schedule to reflect any adjustments to the purchase
price (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) in a manner
consistent with the agreed Final Allocation Schedule and Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder; (iii) prepare and
file all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) in a manner consistent with the
agreed Final Allocation Schedule, as adjusted; and (iv) take no position
inconsistent with the agreed Final Allocation Schedule, as adjusted, for any
Tax purpose (whether in any Tax Return, in any audit, examination or other
Proceeding related to Taxes, or otherwise), unless required to do so by (x) a
determination by IRS Appeals (or any similar level of state Tax
administrative determination) or (y) a final ruling by a trial court;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Party or any of their respective Affiliates
shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability and discretion to concede,
negotiate, compromise, and/or settle any audit, examination or other
Proceeding in connection with the agreed Final Allocation Schedule.

2.6 _Target Equity Awards_.

(a) _Target RSUs_. At the Closing, each Target RSU outstanding immediately
prior to the Closing, whether vested or unvested, will, without any action on
the part of the Buyer, the Seller, the Target or the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive, as the sole consideration
due in respect of such Target RSU, an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to (i) the Class B Unit Value, multiplied by (ii) the total number of
Interests subject to such Target RSU (the " _RSU Consideration_ ").

 

(b) _Target PSUs_. At the Closing, each Target PSU outstanding immediately
prior to the Closing, whether vested or unvested, will, without any action on
the part of the Buyer, the Seller, the Target or the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive, as the sole consideration
due in respect of such Target PSU, an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to (i) the Class B Unit Value, multiplied by (ii) the total number of
Interests subject to such Target PSU, with the total number of Interests
subject to such Target PSU determined based on actual achievement of
the applicable performance-based vesting conditions as of the Closing (the "
_PSU Consideration_ ").

(c)  _Payment Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but
in any event no later than the date necessary in order to meet the Payment
Deadline (as defined below), the Seller will pay the aggregate (i) RSU
Consideration owed to all holders of Target RSUs; and (ii) PSU Consideration
owed to all holders of Target PSUs, in each case, if any, such that, no later
than sixty (60) calendar days following the Closing Date (the "
_Payment Deadline_ "), each of the applicable holders of Target Equity Awards
will receive a payment from the Seller, through its payroll system or payroll
provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such holder in respect of his
or her Target Equity Awards that are cancelled and converted pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_, as applicable, net of any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Tax Law; _provided_ , that if any
payment owed to a holder of Target Equity Awards pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.6(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_, as applicable, cannot be made through the
Sellers payroll system or payroll provider, then the Seller will, (A) by
wire transfer or direct deposit, or (B) by a check sent by

 



6

    

 overnight courier to such holder, provide such payment owed to such holder,
net of any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Tax Law, by the Payment
Deadline. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any such amounts
relate to a Target RSU or Target PSU that is nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Seller shall pay such
amounts at the earliest time permitted under the terms of the applicable
agreement, plan or arrangement relating to such Target RSU or Target PSU that
will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

 

(d) _Further Actions_. The Seller shall (i) cause the Target to take all
actions reasonably necessary to effect the cancellation of the Target Equity
Awards upon the Closing and to give effect to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ and (ii)
from and after the Closing, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Related Parties from and against any and all Losses, as incurred, arising out
of or relating to (A) the cancellation and conversion of the Target Equity
Awards, (B) the calculation or payment of, or failure to pay, the RSU
Consideration or the PSU Consideration in accordance with the Organizational
Documents of the Target and the terms and conditions of the Target Equity
Awards, (C) any other failure by the Seller to take all actions reasonably
necessary to give effect to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ or (D) any Claim asserted by
any holder of the Target RSUs or Target PSUs with respect to any of the
foregoing matters of _Section_ __ _ 2.6_.

 

2.7 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the Buyer and the Escrow Agent (and any other Person acting on
their behalf) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise payable in connection with this Agreement or any Transaction
Document such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld with respect
to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law; _provided, however_ ,
that the Buyer, the Escrow Agent or any other Person acting on their behalf,
as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Seller
in writing prior to deducting or withholding any amounts pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_ that such deduction or withholding is required and
provide the Seller with a reasonable opportunity to contest such deduction and
withholding and/or provide appropriate documentation to permit such amounts
to be paid without deduction and withholding or at a reduced rate of deduction
and withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

2.8 _Indemnity Escrow_ _Fund_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Buyer Related Parties from and against any and all Losses, as
incurred, arising out of or relating to (A) Targets obligations under the
Synthetic Equity Interest Agreement, including any payment obligation
thereunder, or (B) any Claim asserted by any party to the Synthetic Equity
Interest Agreement (or assignee or successor in interest thereto) with respect
to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
connection therewith, the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be held in
escrow, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, until the Indemnity Escrow Fund
Release Date; _provided_ that, from and after the Closing (but subject to the
provisions of the Escrow Agreement), in the event that any Buyer Related Party
incurs any Losses with respect to the matters described in _clause (A)_ or
_(B)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_, the Buyer shall be entitled to recover
first from the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the Buyer and the Seller shall
execute and deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to
release proceeds from the Indemnity Escrow Account

 



7

    

 to the Buyer in respect of any such Losses. On the Indemnity Escrow Fund
Release Date and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the
Buyer and the Seller shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow

prevent the Buyer and its Representatives from contacting or communicating
with any Person in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Buyer and its
Affiliates for matters unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this

to cover the Assets or any Liability arising from the business or operations
of the Target Companies; _provided_ that, with respect to events or
circumstances relating to the Assets or Target Companies that occurred or

the Seller, make claims under the Seller Insurance to the extent such
coverage and limits are available to the Target Companies under the Seller
Insurance. The Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to monitor
or associate with such claims. By making any claims under the Seller
Insurance, the Buyer agrees to promptly (and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days) reimburse the Seller Parties for all documented costs and
expenses (including any increased premiums, claim handling fees, allocated
claims expenses, losses, liabilities or fees) incurred by any Seller Party as
a result of such claims, and the Buyer shall exclusively bear the amount of
any "deductible" or net retention associated with any claims under the Seller
Insurance. In order to support this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, the Seller shall, at
the Buyers sole expense, cooperate with the Buyer to make claims and amend
the Employment Practices Liability and Directors and Officers Liability
insurance policies specifically related to extended reporting or run off
endorsements and policy changes triggered by the Closing. The applicable
Seller Party shall retain all rights to control its insurance policies
or programs, including the right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy
back or otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any of its insurance
policies and programs. The Seller and its Affiliates may, to be effective as
of the Closing, amend any insurance policies in the manner it deems
appropriate to give effect to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_; _provided_ that no
such amendment or modification shall materially impair the Buyers or the
Target Companies rights under this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ with respect to the
Seller Insurance. From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall be responsible
for securing all insurance it considers appropriate for its operation of the
Assets.

 

6.6 _Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
the Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate with the other and use (and shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Target Companies and
the Buyers Subsidiaries, respectively, to use) its commercially reasonable
efforts to (a) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to
be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to
the Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no
later than the Outside Date) and to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect
all necessary filings, Notifications, notices, petitions,

 



33

    

 statements, waivers, submissions of information, applications and other
documents, (b) obtain promptly (and in any event no later than the Outside
Date) and maintain all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, registrations, Permits, Authorizations and
other confirmations from any Governmental Authority or Third Person necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (c)
defend any Proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or seek to have lifted or rescinded any
injunction or restraining order or other Order adversely affecting the ability
of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Parties acknowledge and agree that the obligations of
the Parties with respect thereto shall not extend beyond the Outside Date,
and (d) obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties.

6.7 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) The Seller shall, at the sole expense of the Seller, cause to be prepared
and, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, timely file all Tax Returns
required to be filed by or with respect to any of the Target Companies for all
Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date (each, a " _Pre-Closing
Tax Period_") that are due on or after the Closing Date, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, all Tax Returns of any combined group of which each of (i)
a Target Company and (ii) Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (other than
a Target Company) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date for
Texas franchise Tax purposes (including in each such Tax Return any and all
items and activities of the Target Companies through and including the Closing
Date), and Seller (or such Affiliate of Seller treated as the reporting
entity for Texas franchise Tax purposes) shall pay all Texas franchise Taxes
owed with respect to such Tax Returns; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer
shall take no action on the Closing Date after the Closing that would have
the effect of increasing the amount of Texas gross receipts incurred by any
Target Company on the Closing Date.

 

(ii) The Buyer shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns of the Target
Companies for all Straddle Periods.

(iii) All Tax Returns described in _Sections 6.7(a)(i)_ and _6.7(a)(ii)_
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice of the applicable
Target Company, and without a change of any election or any accounting method.
Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing any such Tax
Return, the Seller or Buyer (as applicable) shall deliver a draft of such Tax
Return (together with schedules, statements and supporting documentation) to
the Buyer or Seller (as applicable) for its review and reasonable comment.
The filing Party shall cause such Tax Return (as revised to incorporate the
other Partys reasonable comments made in writing to the filing Party before
the due date for such Tax Return) to be timely filed.

 

(iv) Except as otherwise required by Law, without the prior written consent of
the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), neither the Buyer nor any Target Company, nor any Affiliate thereof,
shall, with respect to any Target Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
any Straddle Period: (A) make any election under the Code or any other Tax
Law (other than an election required to be made under Sections 6226(a) or

 



34

    

 754 of the Code pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)(vi)_ or otherwise
expressly required pursuant to this Agreement); or (B) file any amended Tax
Return, initiate any voluntary disclosure agreement or program, or similar
disclosure process, or agree to any adjustment of any Tax item with a
Governmental Authority that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Return
or Straddle Period Tax Return of a Target Company, if in any such case, such
action would have the effect of increasing the Sellers or any of its direct
or indirect owners liability for any Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties agree that, in the absence of a final determination to the contrary,
the Synthetic Equity Interest Agreement shall not be treated as having caused
any Target Company to constitute a partnership for any Tax purpose or caused
any Target Company to have been party to any Tax partnership or similar
arrangement; _provided_ , however, that in the event there is a material
change under the Synthetic Equity Interest Agreement to the economic
entitlements of the parties thereto after the Closing that causes the Buyer
to conclude that it is required by Law to treat the Synthetic Equity Interest
Agreement as having caused a Target Company to constitute a partnership or to
be party to a Tax partnership or similar arrangement for a Straddle Period or
a Tax period following the Closing, the Buyer shall be entitled to act
consistently with such determination; _provided further_ , however, that the
Buyer shall consult with the Seller regarding such determination and take
the Sellers input into account in good faith before taking any action
consistent with such determination.

(v) If any Target Company receives a Tax refund or applies a credit against
Taxes which refund or credit arises from or is attributable to the Sales Tax
Contest, such refund or the amount of such credit (less any reasonable costs
incurred by the Buyer or any Target Company to obtain such refund or credit)
shall be paid to the Seller; _provided_ , that the Buyer or the applicable
Target Company shall be entitled to either withhold payment of such refund to
the Seller until the Seller obtains a written release of the Buyer from any
obligations to Ernst and Young with respect to the contingent fee engagement
related to the Sales Tax Contest or, without duplication, pay such contingent
fee out of the proceeds of the Sales Tax Contest; and _provided_ , further,
that the Buyer shall be entitled to offset against the amount of such refund
any Liabilities for Taxes related to the Sales Tax Contest that are imposed on
any Target Company or for which Buyer or any Target Company are held liable
(directly or indirectly). For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller shall have the sole right to
control the Sales Tax Contest and shall keep the Buyer reasonably informed
with respect to same.

(vi) To the extent any Target Company is, pursuant to either (1) a final
determination or (2) a preliminary finding by a Governmental Authority that
requires a Target Company to appoint a "partnership representative" under
Section 6223 of the Code, determined to have constituted a partnership for Tax
purposes or determined to have been party to any Tax partnership or similar
arrangement, in each case, during any Pre-Closing Tax Period, with respect to
any adjustment of any Tax item, or any audit, examination or other
Proceeding related to any Target Company (or such Tax partnership or similar
arrangement), the Seller shall, to the extent permitted by Law, take, and
cause its Affiliates to take, such actions as are needed to cause the
applicable Target Company (or such Tax partnership or similar arrangement) to
(A) cause the Buyer to be designated as the "partnership representative" of
the applicable Target Company (or such Tax partnership or similar
arrangement), and to cause Buyers appointee to be designated as the
"designated individual" to act on behalf of Buyer in its capacity as
partnership representative of the applicable Target Company (or such Tax
partnership or similar arrangement), in each case, 

 



35

    

 by executing IRS Form 8979 or such successor or similar form or
authorization prescribed for such purpose (and any corresponding or similar
form required to approve such similar designations under applicable state or
local Tax Law), (B) make a timely "push out" election under Section 6226(a) of
the Code (and any corresponding or similar provision of state or local Tax
Law) for such Pre-Closing Tax Period, and (C) file an actual or protective
election (as the case may be) under Section 754 of the Code with the next Tax
Return eligible to be filed. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing about this
_Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)(vi)_ shall be interpreted as modifying any other
requirement or obligation under this agreement, including, without limitation,
the obligations in  _Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)(iv)_.

(b) _Cooperation_. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit
examinations and any administrative or judicial Proceedings relating to the
Tax Liabilities imposed on or with respect to any Target Company, the Parties
shall cooperate fully with each other, including the furnishing or making
available during normal business hours of records, information, personnel (as
reasonably required), books of account, or other materials reasonably relevant
or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns, the conduct of audit
examinations or any administrative or judicial Proceedings or the defense of
Claims by Governmental Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes. The Parties
agree to: (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Target Companies relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
any Straddle Period until the earlier of (A) sixty (60) days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and any extension thereof
for the respective taxable periods and (B) the wind-down, dissolution or
liquidation of either Party, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Governmental Authority; and (ii) give the other Party
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records (including in the event of the wind-down, dissolution
or liquidation of a Party) and, if such other Party so requests, allow such
other Party to take possession of such books and records.

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. Neither Buyer nor Seller anticipates that the purchase
and sale of the Interests described hereunder will result in any Liabilities
for Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence or
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all Transfer Taxes shall be borne
by the Buyer. The Buyer and the Seller shall, upon written request from the
Buyer, use their commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any such Transfer Tax that could be imposed.

 

(d) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Seller shall cause any and all Tax allocation,
sharing and indemnity Contracts and any other similar Contract or other
agreement or arrangement relating to Taxes (whether written or unwritten)
solely between any of the Target Companies, on the one hand, and the Seller or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Target Companies), on the other hand,
to be terminated at or prior to the Closing. After such termination, none of
the Target Companies shall have any further rights or liabilities thereunder.
At or prior to Closing, Seller and each of its Affiliates that are parties to
the LINN Tax Matters Agreement shall enter into a waiver and release
agreement with respect to the LINN Tax Matters Agreement (the " _LINN Tax
Matters Termination Agreement_ ") pursuant to which Seller and each such
Seller Affiliate will waive all rights against the Target Companies which
Seller or such Seller Affiliate may have under the LINN Tax Matters Agreement.

less advantageous to the managers, managing members, directors and officers
of the Seller and the Target Companies as the "directors and officers"
liability insurance maintained by the Target Companies or any Person on behalf
of the Target Companies immediately prior to the Closing Date with respect to
claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred on or prior to the
Closing Date (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_").

(c) The obligations of the Buyer and the Target Companies under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as
to adversely affect any manager, managing member, director or officer of the
Seller or the Target Companies, as applicable, to whom this  _Section_ __ _
6.8_ applies without the consent of such affected Person (it being expressly
agreed that such managers, managing members, directors and officers to whom
this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_).

 

(d) In the event the Buyer, the Target Companies or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person

hereto as  _Exhibit C_ , naming the Buyer as the "named insured" and the
Buyer Related Parties as "additional insureds". The Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions set forth in the
Binder Agreement to ensure that the RandW Insurance Policy is fully bound and
in full force and effect at the Closing.

 



37

    

(b) In connection with the RandW Insurance Policy, the Buyer shall not, and
shall ensure that its Affiliates, officers, managers, members, equityholders,
directors, agents and Representatives do not, amend or modify the RandW
Insurance Policy in any manner adverse to the Seller (including the provision
under the RandW Insurance Policy that, absent Fraud, waives subrogation rights
of the insurer thereunder against the Seller) or terminate the RandW Insurance
Policy once fully bound and in full force and effect at the Closing.

 

(c) The cost of obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy, including all premiums and
any related brokers fees, surplus line fees, and any Taxes payable thereto,
shall be paid by the Buyer at or prior to the Closing.

(d) To the extent that Buyer intends after the Closing to make or consider
making a Claim under the RandW Insurance Policy and deems the assistance and

or safety Law or state or federal statutory Law.

(b) In no event shall the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement (including this _Section_ __ _ 6.20_):

(i) Nothing in this Agreement (including this  _Section_ __ _ 6.20_) shall

47

    

6.21 _Financing Efforts_.

 

(a) The Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be

proper or advisable to maintain in effect, arrange and consummate the Debt

or cause the satisfaction of, or obtain a waiver of, on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to the Buyer under the Debt Commitment Letter on or
prior to the Closing Date; (ii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements (to the extent not already entered into) with respect
to the Debt Financing on the terms and subject to the conditions contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter (including all "market flex" provisions thereof)
(the " _Definitive Agreements_ "); (iii) subject to clause (iv) of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.21_, consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to or
substantially concurrently with Closing and (iv) enforce its rights under the
Debt Commitment Letter to the extent necessary to cause the Debt Financing
Sources to provide the proceeds of the Debt Financing to the Buyer in
accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter in the event of a breach by the
Debt Financing Sources or other parties thereto to the extent such breach
results in a failure or material delay to consummate the transactions under
this Agreement. The Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Seller, permit any amendment or modification to be made to, consent to any
waiver of any provision or remedy of, or replace the Debt Commitment Letter if
such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement (x) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be
paid or original issue discount thereof) below the amount necessary to
consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, unless Buyer will
otherwise have available cash sufficient to consummate the Closing, or (y)
imposes any new or additional condition to the Debt Financing, or otherwise
amends, modifies or expands any condition to the Debt Financing in any
respect. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to clauses (x) and (y) above,
nothing herein shall prevent the Buyer from replacing or amending the Debt
Commitment Letter in order to add lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities which had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter
as of the date hereof and amend the economic or other arrangements among the
existing and additional lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities, or to replace the commitment parties with new
commitment parties if the addition of such additional parties does not reduce
the aggregate net amount to be funded under the Debt Commitment Letter at the
Closing as compared to the amount to be funded at the Closing under the Debt
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof.

(b) The Buyer shall keep the Seller reasonably informed in reasonable detail
of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and shall provide
senior members of management of the Company a reasonable opportunity to review
on any materials that are to be presented to them during any meetings
conducted in connection with the Debt Financing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Buyer shall give the Seller prompt (and in
any event, within three (3) Business Days) written notice (i) of any default
or breach that would materially delay, impede or prevent the funding of the
Debt Financing (or any event that, with our without notice, lapse of time or
both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any default or breach that
would materially delay, impede or prevent the funding of the Debt Financing)
by any party to the Debt Financing of which the Buyer becomes aware, and (ii)
of the receipt of any written notice or other communication from any Person
with respect to any (A) actual default, breach, termination or repudiation by
any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or (B) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or any
other event or condition, in each case, which would cause or reasonably be
expected to cause any condition to the Debt Financing to fail to be
satisfied. In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing is otherwise

 



48

    

 unavailable, the Buyer shall give the Seller prompt (and in any event,
within three (3) Business Days) written notice thereof (and the reasons
therefor) and shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and to obtain
(having conditions to closing that are not more onerous to the Buyer, taken as
a whole, than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter) a Substitute Debt
Financing as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
but, in no event, later than the date that the Buyer is required to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with this Agreement. The
Buyer shall deliver promptly to the Seller true, accurate and complete copies
of all agreements (provided that any fee letter will be redacted in a
customary manner) pursuant to which any such alternative sources of the
Substitute Debt Financing shall have committed to provide any portion of the
Debt Financing (the " _Substitute Financing Commitments_ "). The terms of
_Section_ __ _ 6.21(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.21(b)_ with respect to the Debt
Financing and the Debt Commitment Letter, shall apply to the Substitute Debt
Financing and the Substitute Financing Commitments, _mutatis mutandis_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, it is understood and agreed
that the Buyers obligations hereunder, and Closing, are not in any manner
subject to or conditioned upon the Buyers receipt of all or any portion of
the Debt Financing or any Substitute Debt Financing.

6.22 _Services_. The Buyer and the Seller will work in good faith to finalize
Schedule 1.1 to the Transition Services Agreement prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , in no event will the Seller or its Affiliates be
obligated to perform services that they are not performing as of the Execution
Date. The Parties shall make appropriate revisions to the Transition Services
Agreement to correspond to the agreed-upon Services.

ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION 

9.1 _Termination at or Prior to the Closing_. This Agreement may be terminated
prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Seller and the Buyer;

 

(b) by the Seller or the Buyer at any time after the Outside Date, upon
written notice to the other Party, if the Closing has not been consummated on
or before the Outside Date; _provided,_ that, if on the Outside Date the
condition to Closing set forth in either _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_ (No
Restraints) or _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ (No Proceedings Seeking Restraints)
has not been satisfied, but all other conditions to Closing in _Article_ __ _
VII_ have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied, then the Outside
Date may be extended on one or more occasions to a date not later than ninety
(90) days after the Outside Date at the option of the Buyer by providing
written notice to the Seller at or before 11:59 p.m. Houston, Texas time on
the Outside Date; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_ will not be available to a
Party if the other Party has filed (and is then pursuing) an action seeking
specific performance as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 11.12_;

(c) by the Seller or the Buyer, upon written notice to the other Party, if
any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_ is in
effect and has become final and nonappealable;

 



53

    

(d) by the Seller, upon written notice to the Buyer, if the Buyer
has breached any of its representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement (or if any such representations or warranties fail to be true) or
the Buyer has failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement (other than the Buyers covenant to deliver the Deposit to
the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_, which shall be handled
exclusively in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(f)_ below), which breach or failure (i)
would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or _Section_
__ _ 7.2(b)_ and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured by the
Buyer by the earlier of (A) the Outside Date and (B) thirty (30) days
following receipt of written notice from the Seller of such breach or failure;

 

(e) by the Buyer, upon written notice to the Seller, if the Seller has
breached any of its representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement
(or if any such representations or warranties fail to be true) or the Seller
has failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure (i) would (if it occurred or
was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ and
(ii) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured by the Seller by the
earlier of (A) the Outside Date and (B) thirty (30) days following receipt of
written notice from the Buyer of such breach or failure; or

 

(f) by the Seller, upon written notice to the Buyer, if the Buyer does not
deposit the Deposit with the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_
at or before 11:59 p.m. Houston, Texas time on the first Business Day after
the Execution Date.

 

9.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section_
__ _ 9.1_, written notice thereof will be given to the other Party,
specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination
is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
further obligation on the part of any Party or its respective
Representatives, except that the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.2(d)_,
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(e)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.12_, this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_
and  _Article_ __ _ XI_ (other than _Section_ __ _ 11.12_), and the
Confidentiality Agreement (which shall continue pursuant to its terms) shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) If the Seller validly terminates this Agreement under _Section_ __ _
9.1(d)_, then the Seller shall be entitled to receive (x) the entire Deposit
from the Deposit Escrow Account, plus (y) an additional amount in cash equal
to five percent (5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (items (x) and (y)
collectively, the " _Termination Fee_ ") for the sole account and use of the
Seller as liquidated damages under this Agreement, which remedy shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy available to the Seller for any breach by the Buyer.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that if the Seller receives the Termination
Fee under this _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_, the actual amount of damages resulting
from such a termination would be difficult if not impossible to determine
accurately because of, among other things: (w) the unique nature of this
Agreement; (x) the unique nature of the Assets; (y) the uncertainties of
applicable commodity markets; and (z) differences of opinion with respect to
such matters that inherently make damages difficult to ascertain.
Consequently, in such case, the Parties further acknowledge and agree that the
liquidated damages associated with receipt by the Seller of the Termination
Fee are a reasonable estimate by the Parties of such damages under
the circumstances and do not constitute a penalty.

 



54

    

(c) If this Agreement is terminated under  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ and the
Seller is not entitled to receive the Termination Fee under _Section_ __ _
9.2(b)_, then the Buyer shall be entitled to receive the entirety of the
Deposit. If the Buyer validly terminates this Agreement under _Section_ __ _
9.1(e)_, then the Buyer shall be entitled to seek any and all rights or
remedies against the Seller available at law, in equity or otherwise with
respect to any willful and intentional breach of this Agreement by the
Seller, in which case the Buyer shall only be entitled to recover from the
Seller the actual Losses suffered by the Buyer as a consequence of such
termination; _provided_ that Buyers recovery shall not exceed an amount
equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price.

(d) Once the Buyer or the Seller becomes entitled to receive the Deposit in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_ or this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, each of
the Buyer and the Seller covenants and agrees that such Party shall promptly,
and in any event within three (3) Business Days, execute and deliver to the
Escrow Agent joint written instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse from the Deposit Escrow Account to the Buyer or the Seller, as
applicable, an amount equal to the Deposit. If the Seller becomes entitled to
receive the Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, the
Buyer covenants and agrees that it shall promptly, and in any event within
three (3) Business Days, make available to the Seller via wire transfer of
immediately available funds in such account specified by Seller an amount
equal to the remainder of the Termination Fee (net of the Deposit, which shall
be disbursed to the Seller in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (other than as
set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(h)_), payment of the Termination Fee (to
the extent payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_) to the Seller shall be
deemed liquidated damages and constitute the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy of the Seller, the Target Companies, each of their respective
Affiliates and the respective Representatives of each of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Seller Related Parties_ ") against Buyer, Sponsor, the
Debt Financing Sources, and each of the foregoing Persons former, current or
future Affiliates, portfolio companies, investment vehicles, controlling
persons, officers, directors, employees, equityholders, partners, members,
managers, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the
" _Buyer Related Parties_ ") for, and the Seller Related Parties shall be
deemed to have waived all other remedies with respect to, any Losses suffered
as a result of the failure of the Closing to occur or for a breach or failure
to perform hereunder or otherwise (in any case, whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) and none of the Buyer Related
Parties shall have any further Liability relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein. No Seller Related Party
shall be entitled to bring, and the Seller shall cause all other Seller
Related Parties not to bring, and shall in no event support, facilitate or
encourage, the bringing of any Proceeding (under any legal theory, whether
sounding in law or in equity (in each case whether for breach of contract, in
tort or otherwise)) against a Buyer Related Party with respect to, arising out
of, or in connection with, the failure of the Closing to occur or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise (in any case, whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), other than a
Proceeding to seek to obtain the payment of the Termination Fee or
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief solely to the
extent permitted by _Section_ __ _ 11.12_, and the Seller shall cause any
such Proceeding pending as of any termination of this Agreement to be
dismissed with prejudice as promptly as practicable after such termination.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including this
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(e)_), if the Termination Fee is paid to the Seller as
liquidated damages in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_, under no
circumstances will any Seller Related Party, or the Seller Related Parties in
the aggregate, be entitled to monetary damages or monetary 

 



55

    

 remedies for any claims, damages or other Losses suffered as a result of the
failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated
or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or thereunder or for any
representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, in excess of the amount of the Termination Fee.

 

(f) Without limiting the foregoing, if the Buyer fails to effect the Closing
for any or no reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement or fails to perform
hereunder (in any case, whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise), and in each case the Closing has not occurred, in no event shall
the Seller seek or permit to be sought any monetary damages from any Buyer
Related Party in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, other than to the extent that the entire amount of the
Termination Fee has not been paid in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _
9.2_ (provided, that in such case, the aggregate amount payable under this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall not
exceed an amount equal to the portion of the Termination Fee that has not
already been paid, if any).

(g) Without limiting the foregoing, if the Seller fails to effect the Closing
for any or no reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement or fails to perform
hereunder (in any case, whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise), and in each case the Closing has not occurred, in no event shall
the Buyer seek or permit to be sought any monetary damages from the Seller in
connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
other than (without duplication) from the Seller to the extent provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(c)_ (provided, that in such case, the aggregate amount
payable under this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be the actual Losses suffered by the Buyer as a
consequence of such failure; _provided_ that Buyers recovery shall not
exceed an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price (in addition to the return of any portion of the Deposit from the
Deposit Escrow Account that has not already been paid to the Buyer, if any)).

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_,
for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ shall limit
either Partys rights under _Section_ __ _ 11.12_ to specifically enforce
this Agreement prior to Closing in lieu of terminating this Agreement.

9.3 _Return of Documentation and Confidentiality_. Upon termination of
this Agreement, the Buyer shall comply with the obligation in the
Confidentiality Agreement regarding the return or destruction of the
"Confidential Information" (as defined therein), in each case in accordance
with (and subject to the exceptions set forth in) the Confidentiality
Agreement.

Agreement that by its terms is to be performed following the Closing, which

related to or in connection with this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and subject to _Article IX_ , this _Article X_ ,

extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and
causes of action (except for claims of Fraud) that it or any of its respective

obligations arising hereunder without the prior written consent of the other
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the consent of the Seller, the
Buyer may, without relieving the Buyer from its Liabilities or obligations

to an Affiliate of Buyer or to an entity formed, controlled and primarily
owned by Buyer. Subject to the preceding sentence of this _Section_ __ _
11.1_, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be

specifically stating that it amends, supersedes or cancels this Agreement. Any
of the terms of this Agreement and any condition to a Partys obligations
hereunder may be waived only in writing by that Party specifically stating
that it waives a term or condition hereof. No waiver by a Party of any one or
more conditions or defaults by the other in performance of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver of any
future conditions or defaults, whether of a like or different character, nor
shall the waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided in writing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement,  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(e)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.2(f)_, this
_Section_ __ _ 11.2_, _Section_ __ _ 11.6_, _Section_ __ _ 11.11_,

59

    

11.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain
in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner materially
adverse to either Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end that the

possible.

11.8 _Conflict Wavier; Attorney-Client Privilege_.

 

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that Kirkland and Ellis LLP ("
_Seller_ __ _ Counsel_") represented the Seller and the Target Companies in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents. The Buyer agrees, on its own behalf and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Target Companies, that, following consummation of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement, such representation and any
prior representation of the Target Companies by Seller Counsel shall not
preclude Seller Counsel from serving as counsel to the Seller or any
director, member, shareholder, partner, officer or employee of the Seller, in
connection with any litigation, Claim or obligation arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The Buyer shall not, and after the Closing, shall cause the
Target Companies not to, seek or have Seller Counsel disqualified from any
such representation based upon the prior representation of the Target
Companies by Seller Counsel prior to Closing. Each of the Parties consents
thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising from such prior
representation, and each of such Parties shall cause any of its Affiliates to
consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from such representation.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that the waiver and consent set forth in
the preceding sentence only applies to the Seller and not to any Third Person.
Each of the Parties acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary,
that it has been carefully considered, and that the Parties have consulted
with counsel or have been advised they should do so in connection herewith.
The covenants, consent and waiver contained in this _Section_ __ _ 11.8_
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Seller Counsel is
entitled whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

(c) The Buyer and the Seller agree that any attorney-client
privilege, attorney work-product protection, and expectation of client
confidence attaching as a result of Seller Counsels representation of the
Target Companies in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents and in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, and all information and documents covered by such
privilege or protection, shall belong to and be controlled by the Seller and
may be waived only by the Seller, and not by any Target Company, and shall
not pass to or be claimed or used by the Buyer or the Target Companies, except
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.8(d)_.

 



63

    

(d) In the event that a dispute arises between the Buyer or the
Target Companies, on the one hand, and a Third Person other than the Seller
or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, the Target Companies may assert
the attorney-client privilege on behalf of the Seller to the extent necessary
to prevent disclosure of privileged materials described in _Section_ __ _
11.8(c)_ to such Third Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that such privilege
may be waived only with the prior written consent of the Seller (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

11.9 _Rules of Construction; Joint Drafting_.

 

(a) In construing this Agreement, the following principles will be followed,
in each case unless expressly provided otherwise in a particular instance:

proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement or interim drafts of this
Agreement.

 



64

    

11.10 _Offset_. Nothing contained herein shall impair or constitute a waiver
of any right of offset or setoff for any Party.

11.11 _No Partnership; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to create a joint venture, partnership, Tax partnership, or
agency relationship between or among the Parties. This Agreement shall not
confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights (including third-
party beneficiary rights or otherwise) or remedies under this Agreement,
except for (i) the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.2(d)_ (Access
Indemnification), _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ (Continuation of Indemnity; DandO Tail
Coverage)  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ (Effect of Termination), _Article X_
(Survival and Remedies), this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ (No Partnership; No
Third-Party Beneficiary), and _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ (Release); and (ii)
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Debt Financing Sources
shall be express third party beneficiaries of _Section_ __ _ 11.2_
(Amendments and Waiver) (as it relates to the Debt Financing Sources),
_Section_ __ _ 11.6(a)_ (as it relates to the Debt Financing Sources),
_Section_ __ _ 11.6(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 11.6(e)_, this _Section_ __ _
11.11_ (No Partnership; No Third-Party Beneficiary) (as it relates to the
Debt Financing Sources), and _Section_ __ _ 11.14(b)_, and each of such
Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of the Debt Financing Sources
and the Debt Financing Sources shall be entitled to rely on and enforce the
provisions of such Sections.

11.12 _Specific Performance_. Each Party agrees that irreparable damage would
occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
in addition to any other remedies available under this Agreement, the Parties
agree that, prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 9.1_, each Party will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent the
other Partys breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and
hereby waives (a) any defenses in any Proceeding for an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief, including the defense that the other
Party has an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity and (b) any requirement
under Law to post a bond, undertaking or other security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief. The Parties acknowledge and agree that if the
Buyer or the Seller exercises its right to terminate this Agreement under
_Section_ __ _ 9.1_, then such Person shall not thereafter have the right to
specific performance under this _Section_ __ _ 11.12._

11.13 _Disclosure Schedule_. The Disclosure Schedules to this Agreement are
arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in this Agreement merely
for convenience, and the disclosure of any fact or item in one section or
subsection of such Disclosure Schedules to any particular covenant,
representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed with respect
to all other covenants, representations or warranties, notwithstanding the
presence or absence of an appropriate section or subsection of
such Disclosure Schedules with respect to such other covenants,
representations or warranties or an appropriate cross-reference thereto, in
each case to the extent relevancy of such disclosure to such other covenants,
representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure that such disclosed information is applicable thereto.
Additionally, for each of the Disclosure Schedules, the mere inclusion of an
item in such Disclosure Schedules as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself
and solely by virtue of the inclusion

 



65

    

 of such information in such Disclosure Schedules, that such information is
required to be listed in such Disclosure Schedules or that such item (or
any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance)
represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance, that such item
has had, or is expected to result in, a Target Material Adverse Effect, that
such item actually constitutes noncompliance with, or a violation of, any Law,
Permit or Contract or other topic to which such disclosure is applicable or
that such item is outside the Ordinary Course of Business. The specification
of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedules is
not intended to imply that such amounts (or higher or lower amounts) are or
are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such
amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Disclosure
Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item, or matter not described in this Agreement or included in a
Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.
Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules, unless otherwise defined
therein, shall have the meanings assigned to them in this Agreement.

11.14 _Non-Recourse_.

 

(a) All causes of action or Proceedings (whether in contract or in tort, in
equity or at Law, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect
of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any
manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery, performance or breach of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be brought only against (and are those solely of) the
Seller Parties and the Buyer Parties (each, a " _Recourse Party_ "). No Person
who is not a Recourse Party, including any past, present or future direct or
indirect equity holder, Affiliate (other than Subsidiaries of such Recourse
Party) or Representative of such Recourse Party, such equity holder or such
Affiliate (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_"), shall have any Liability or other
obligation (whether in contract or in tort, in equity or at Law, or granted by
statute) for any cause of action or Proceeding arising under, out of, in
connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in
respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, preparation,
execution, delivery, performance, or breach; and, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law, each Party, on behalf of itself and, in the case
of the Seller, the other Seller Parties, and in the case of the Buyer, the
other Buyer Parties, hereby waives and releases all such causes of action and
Proceedings against any such Non-Recourse Party. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Law, (a) each Party, on behalf of itself and, in the case of the Seller, the
other Seller Parties, and in the case of the Buyer, the other Buyer Parties,
hereby waives and releases any and all causes of action or Proceedings that
may otherwise be brought in equity or at Law, or granted by statute, to avoid
or disregard the entity form of a Recourse Party or otherwise impose
Liability or other obligation of any Recourse Party on any Non-Recourse Party,
whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control,
instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise,
piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise; and (b) each
Party, on behalf of itself and, in the case of the Seller, the other Seller
Parties, and in the case of the Buyer, the other Buyer Parties, disclaims any
reliance upon any Non-Recourse Party with respect to the performance of this
Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as
an inducement to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 11.14_ shall preclude any party to the Escrow Agreement,
the Confidentiality Agreement or any other Transaction Document from making
any claim thereunder, to the extent permitted therein and pursuant to the
terms thereof (and subject to the applicable limitations set forth therein).

 



66

    

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller Parties shall not
have any claim against any Debt Financing Source (solely in its capacity as a
Debt Financing Source) (or any of its respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, agents,
Representatives, Affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively, " _Debt
Finance Related Parties_ ")) nor shall any Debt Financing Source (solely in
its capacity as a Debt Financing Source) or any Debt Finance Related Parties
(solely in its capacity as a Debt Finance Related Party) have any liability
whatsoever to the Seller Parties, in connection with the Debt Financing, the
Debt Commitment Letter or in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions or services contemplated thereby or hereby, whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

11.15 _Release_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, the Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its direct and indirect equity holders, Affiliates (including the Target
Companies following the Closing) and Representatives, and its and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives, and each of the respective heirs,
executors, administrators, successors and permitted assigns of each of the
foregoing (each, a " _Buyer_ _Releasing Person_ "), hereby absolutely and
unconditionally releases and forever discharges each of the Seller, its past,
present and future direct and indirect equity holders, Affiliates and
Representatives, and each of its and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives, and each of the respective heirs, executors, administrators,
successors and permitted assigns of each of the foregoing (each, a " _Seller_

Proceeding with respect to, any Losses or Liabilities whatsoever, of any kind
or nature, whether at law or in equity (" _Released Claims_ "), which have
been or could have been asserted against any Seller Released Person, which any
Buyer Releasing Person has or ever had, which arises out of or in any way
relates to events, circumstances or actions occurring, existing or taken
prior to or as of the Closing Date in respect of matters relating to the
Sellers ownership of the Interests or ownership or operation of the Target
Companies, or their respective businesses, or the negotiation of this
Agreement. Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 11.15(a)_ is intended to,
nor does it, limit, impair or otherwise modify or affect any rights or
obligations of the Seller Released Persons expressly set forth in this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the Contribution Agreement, or
any facts, circumstances or claims to the extent entitling a Buyer Releasing
Person to any recovery under this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents
or the Contribution Agreement.

(b) Effective as of the Closing, the Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf
of its direct and indirect equity holders, Affiliates (including the Target
Companies prior to the Closing) and Representatives, and its and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives, and each of the respective heirs,

present and future direct and indirect equity holders, Affiliates and
Representatives, and each of its and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives, and each of the respective heirs, executors, administrators,
successors and permitted assigns of each of the foregoing (each, a " _Buyer_
_Released Person_ ") from, and agrees not to assert any Released Claim, which
have been or could have been asserted against any Buyer Released Person, which
any Seller Releasing Person has or ever had, which arises out of or in any
way relates to events, circumstances or actions occurring, existing or taken
after or as of the Closing Date in respect of matters relating to the Buyers
ownership of the Interests or ownership or operation of

 



67

    

 the Target Companies, or their respective businesses. Nothing contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 11.15(b)_ is intended to, nor does it, limit, impair or
otherwise modify or affect any rights or obligations of the Buyer Released
Persons expressly set forth in this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, or any facts, circumstances or claims to the extent entitling a
Seller Releasing Person to any recovery under this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents.

11.16 _Parent Guara_ _nty_.

 

(a) For good and valuable consideration, and to induce Seller to enter into
this Agreement, Parent absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees
to the Seller the punctual and complete performance of all obligations of the
Buyer under this Agreement, including the payment obligations of the Buyer
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_,  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, _Section_ __ _ 2.4_
and _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ (and as also referenced in _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_
(the " _Buyer Obligations_ ")). The limited guaranty set out in this
_Section_ __ _ 11.16_ (the " _Parent Guaranty_ ") shall remain in full force
and effect until the earlier of (i) the performance by the Buyer or Parent to
the Seller of the Buyer Obligations and (ii) termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of _Article IX_.

(b) Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.16_ but in all instances
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ of this
Agreement, Parents liability under this  _Section_ __ _ 11.16_ shall be
absolute, unconditional, irrevocable and continuing irrespective, without
limitation, of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement as
a result of the application of any bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or
other similar laws relating to creditors rights and general principles of
equity to the Buyer; (ii) any modification, amendment, consent, extension,
forbearance or waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement that
may be agreed to by the Parties in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement; (iii) any action or inaction by the Seller under or in respect of
this Agreement, any failure, lack of diligence, omission or delay on the part
of the Seller to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy
conferred on the Seller in this Agreement; (iv) any merger or consolidation of
the Buyer, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates into or with
any Person, or any sale, lease or transfer of any of the assets of Parent,
the Buyer, Seller or any other Person to any other Person; or (v) any change
in the ownership of any of Parent, the Buyer, Seller or any other Person.

 

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ of this
Agreement, upon default by the Buyer, or failure by the Buyer to perform of
any of the Buyer Obligations, Parent shall be liable for the obligations of
the Buyer arising under this Agreement as if it were a primary obligor, and
Seller may immediately proceed directly against Parent without first
proceeding against the Buyer or any other Person or pursuing any other remedy.

(d) Parent waives any defenses which it may have with respect to the
performance of the Buyer Obligations, other than defenses that the Buyer would
have under the terms of this Agreement. Parent further waives notice of the
acceptance of this Parent Guaranty, presentment, demand, protest, and notices
of protest, nonpayment, default or dishonor of the Buyer Obligations. The
other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 11.16(d)_ shall be deemed
incorporated and to apply to this _ Section_ __ _ 11.16(d)_, and Parent

68

    

(e) Parent represents and warrants to the Seller the following:

 

(i) Parent is a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of Delaware. Parent has all requisite limited
liability company power and authority to execute and deliver this Parent
Guaranty and to perform its obligations under this Parent Guaranty.

 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Parent Guaranty, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Parent Guaranty, have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action of Parent or any of
its Affiliates, as applicable.

(iii) This Parent Guaranty has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and
constitutes, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Parent Guaranty, as applicable, by the other Persons that are party thereto,
the valid and binding obligations of Parent, as applicable, enforceable
against Parent, as applicable, in accordance with their respective terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws relating to or affecting
creditors rights generally or by equitable principles (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought at law or in equity).

 

(iv) The execution, delivery and performance of this Parent Guaranty, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Parent Guaranty do not
violate, breach or contravene (a) Parents Organizational Documents or (b) any
Law or contractual restriction binding on or affecting such Parent or its
properties except where such violation, breach or contravention, individually
or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on such Parents ability to perform its obligations under this
Parent Guaranty.
