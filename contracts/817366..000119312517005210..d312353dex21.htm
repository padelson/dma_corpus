(b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Anything in this Agreement to the

loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of the
Company, any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-
Entry Share formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock may
be paid to such a transferee if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
presented to the Payment Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence to the satisfaction of the
Payment Agent that any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have
been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The cash paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ in respect of any shares of

satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock

Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights as
stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (subject to DGCL 262) into which the shares represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have

 



17  been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ or
_3.2(d)_ , as applicable, in each case without interest or duplication. From
and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock converted pursuant to this Agreement are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, Acquiror or the Payment Agent for any reason, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article III_ , subject to DGCL 262 in the case of Dissenting
Shares.

(f) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains
unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Acquiror or a Subsidiary of Acquiror designated by Acquiror, upon
written demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has
not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for
Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Payment Agent pursuant to _Section
3.2(b)_ to pay for Company Shares for which appraisal rights have been
perfected shall be delivered to Acquiror promptly (and in any event within
two (2) Business Days of Acquirors demand to the Payment Agent therefor).

(g) _No Liability_. None of Acquiror, the Company, Merger Sub, the Payment
Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any person in
respect of any portion of the Payment Fund or the Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of the
second anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Acquiror
or the Payment Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Acquiror or the Payment Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Payment Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to _Section
3.2(f)_, Acquiror) shall deliver or cause to be delivered, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration.

shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable
holder of such Company Options shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment in accordance
with this _Section 3.3(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the

effect and the applicable holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto.

Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, fully vest as
to the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to such
Restricted Stock Unit (including, with respect to performance-based Restricted
Stock Units, upon attainment of the target level of performance applicable to
such Restricted Stock Unit) and become free of any vesting, forfeiture or
other restriction, (ii) at the Effective Time, shall entitle the holder
thereof to receive from Acquiror an amount, in cash, equal to the product of
(A) such number of shares of Company Common Stock referenced in clause (i) of
this _Section 3.3(c)_ and (B) the Merger Consideration (the " _RSU Cash
Payment_ ") and (iii) from and after the Effective Time, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each applicable holder of such Restricted Stock Units shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the RSU Cash Payment
in accordance with this _Section 3.3(c)_.

Effective Time) (" _Unvested Proceeds_ "), shall instead be paid to such
holders, together with an additional matching amount equal to the Unvested
Proceeds, on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, but only if the
holders of such awards satisfied the vesting conditions under the applicable
award agreements governing such shares of Company Restricted Stock (determined
as if the vesting date was no earlier than the date that is the first
anniversary of the Closing Date); _provided_ , that any holder of such awards
who is employed or providing service as of the Closing Date, whose employment
or service to the Company or its Subsidiaries terminates as a result of his
death prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date shall be treated as
having satisfied the vesting conditions under the applicable award agreements
governing the applicable shares of Company Restricted Stock and such holders
surviving spouse or designated beneficiary shall be entitled to payment of
the Unvested Proceeds, together with an additional matching amount equal to
the Unvested Proceeds, no later than the first regularly scheduled payroll
date that is at least three (3) Business Days after the Company receives
satisfactory proof of the holders death.

inquiring person to the terms of this _Section 6.3_ and to limit its
communication exclusively to such referral or (y) upon receipt of a _bona
fide_ , unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal from any person that
did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.3_, solely to the extent

6.3(c)_), (C) approve, adopt, publicly recommend or enter into, or publicly

contemplated by a Company Takeover Proposal, (E) otherwise cooperate with or
assist or participate in any such inquiries, proposals, offers, discussions or
negotiations or (F) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company

a Company Takeover Proposal or similar matter or any standstill provision in
any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party;

provisions to the extent necessary to permit a person or group to make, on a
confidential basis to the Company Board of Directors, a Company Takeover
Proposal, conditioned upon such person agreeing to disclosure of such Company
Takeover Proposal to Acquiror, in each case as contemplated by this _Section
6.3_ ( _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company may only take such action if
the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure
of the Company Board of Directors to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law).
None of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall enter into any confidentiality
agreement or other agreement subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from (x) providing to Acquiror or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives the information required to be provided
pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ or (y) otherwise complying with this _Section
6.3_. The Company and Acquiror hereby agree that all standstill or similar
provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement shall, as of the date of this
Agreement, terminate and be of no further force and effect.

 



49 (b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, promptly after the
date hereof request any person that has executed a currently in-effect
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement after January 1, 2015 and in
connection with any actual or potential Company Takeover Proposal to promptly
after the date of such request return or destroy all confidential information
in the possession of such person or its Representatives (other than from any
person with which the Company has entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and, prior to the date of the earlier of (x) the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval and (y) the return or destruction of such
information, enters into negotiations or discussions regarding any Company
Takeover Proposal in accordance with this _Section 6.3_ other than as a
result of any breach of this _Section 6.3_ by the Company).

(c) Anything to the contrary contained in  _Section 6.3(a)_ notwithstanding,
if at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time that the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company or any of
its Representatives receives a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Company
Takeover Proposal from any person that did not result from a breach of this
_Section 6.3_ and if the Company Board of Directors determines, in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior Proposal, then the
Company and its Representatives may, prior to the time the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, (i) furnish, pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the person who has made such Company Takeover
Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company, to the extent permitted under
applicable Law (including any applicable Antitrust Law), shall concurrently
with the delivery to such person provide to Acquiror any non-public
information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided or made available to such person or its Representatives unless such
non-public information has been previously provided or made available to
Acquiror (which non-public information, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and may, in order to comply with
applicable Law, be restricted to certain designated Representatives of
Acquiror) and (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify Acquiror if the Company Board of Directors makes a determination that
a Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Superior Proposal or if the Company furnishes information
or enters into discussions or negotiations as provided in this  _Section
6.3(c)_.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt)
notify Acquiror in the event that the Company or any of its Representatives
receives a Company Takeover Proposal or a request for information relating to
the Company or its Subsidiaries that constitutes or contemplates a Company
Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the person making the Company
Takeover Proposal and a description of the material terms and conditions
thereof. The Company shall keep Acquiror reasonably informed, on a
reasonably current basis, as to the status

 



50  of (including any developments, discussions or negotiations) such Company
Takeover Proposal (including by as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) providing to Acquiror a
description of any changes to the material terms and conditions of such
Company Takeover Proposal).

(e) Except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.3(f)_ or _Section 6.3(g)_,
the Company Board of Directors shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company

withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Acquiror, the Company
Recommendation or (C) adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of the
Company, or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to
adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of the Company a Company Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement (including an acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement), commitment or
agreement in principle with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
_Section 6.3(c)_) (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(f) Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding,
prior to the time that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not
after, the Company Board of Directors may, with respect to a _bona fide_ ,
unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of
this _Section 6.3_, make an Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(g)_ in
order to substantially concurrently with such termination enter into a
definitive agreement relating to such Company Takeover Proposal if and only
if, prior to taking either such action, (i) the Company has complied with its
obligations under this _Section 6.3_, (ii) the Company Board of Directors has
determined, in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (iii) the Company Board of
Directors determines, in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to do
so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , that prior to making such Adverse
Recommendation Change or effecting such termination (and prior to making the
determination set forth in clause (iii)), (A) the Company has given Acquiror
at least five (5) Business Days prior notice of its intention to take such
action, specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions
of, and the identity of the person making, any such Company Takeover Proposal
and has contemporaneously provided to Acquiror a copy of the Company Takeover
Proposal and a copy of any proposed Company Acquisition Agreements and a copy
of any financing commitments relating thereto (or, in each case, if not
provided in writing to the Company, a written summary of the terms and
conditions thereof), (B) the Company shall have negotiated, in good faith,
with Acquiror and its Representatives during such notice period (if, and to
the extent, Acquiror has indicated its desire to negotiate to the Company) to
enable Acquiror to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that
it would cause such Company Takeover Proposal to no longer constitute a
Company Superior Proposal, (C) following the end of such notice period, the
Company Board of Directors shall have considered, in good faith, any revisions
to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Acquiror (and

 



51  not revoked), and shall have determined, in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the Company
Takeover Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company
Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed in writing by Acquiror (and not
revoked) were to be given effect and (D) in the event of any change to any of
the financial terms (including the form, amount, mix and timing of payment of
consideration) or any other material terms of such Company Takeover Proposal,
the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Acquiror an additional
notice consistent with that described in clause (A) above of this proviso and
a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence (except
that the five (5) Business Day notice period referred to in clause (A) above
of this proviso shall instead be equal to the longer of (x) three (3)
Business Days and (y) the period remaining under the notice period under
clause (A) of this proviso immediately prior to the delivery of such
additional notice under this clause (D)) during which time the Company shall
be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.3(f)_ anew
with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D)
above of this proviso; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.3(f)_ and _Section
8.1(g)_ unless the Company pays, or causes to be paid, to Acquiror the
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_ prior to or concurrently with
such termination. Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any Company
Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms.

(g) Other than in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, the Company
Board of Directors may, at any time after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, but not
after, make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company
Intervening Event (a " _Company Intervening Event Recommendation Change_ ")
if (i) the Company has complied with its obligations under this _Section 6.3_
and (ii) prior to taking such action, the Company Board of Directors has
determined, in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , that prior to making such Company
Intervening Event Recommendation Change, (A) the Company has given Acquiror
at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take
such action, and specifying the reasons therefor, including specifying in
reasonable detail the applicable Company Intervening Event, (B) the Company
shall have negotiated, in good faith, with Acquiror and its Representatives
during such notice period to enable Acquiror to propose revisions to the terms
of this Agreement (if, and to the extent, Acquiror has indicated its desire
to negotiate to the Company) and (C) following the end of such notice period,
the Company Board of Directors shall have considered, in good faith, any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Acquiror (and
not revoked), and shall have determined, in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure
to make a Company Intervening Event Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(h) Nothing contained in this  _Section 6.3_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)(2)-(3) or
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication
to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment

 



52  of a tender offer or exchange offer), (ii) making any legally required
(based upon the advice of outside counsel) disclosure to stockholders with
regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or a Company
Takeover Proposal, or (iii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication
to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder; _provided_ ,
that, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this _Section 6.3(h)_, no
such action or disclosure that would amount to an Adverse Recommendation
Change shall be permitted, made or taken other than in compliance with this
_Section 6.3_.

Section 6.4 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Effective Time
(or, if earlier, the date of termination of the applicable Continuing
Employee), Acquiror shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i)
provide each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who continues
as of the Effective Time to be employed by Acquiror, the
Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Acquiror (each, a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") with at least the same level of base salary or hourly wage rate,
as the case may be, that was provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide the Continuing Employees with
other compensation and employee benefits substantially comparable in value, in
the aggregate, to those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including the grant date accounting value of
target equity and equity-based compensation received in 2016, but excluding
the value of any supplemental executive retirement plans and consulting
agreements) (it being understood that any long-term cash incentive, retention
or severance grants, awards or other rights granted by Venice or any of its
Subsidiaries after the date hereof prior to the Effective Time in excess of
the amount set forth on _Section 6.4(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be credited against Acquirors obligations hereunder). At the
first regularly scheduled payroll date of the Company occurring more than
three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay bonuses with respect to the
2016 fiscal year under the VCA Inc. 2015 Annual Cash Incentive Plan to the
extent not previously paid by the Company. In addition, Acquiror shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to perform each obligation of the Company under
each Contract set forth on _Section 6.4(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule in accordance with each such Contracts respective terms if, and to
the extent, not performed by the Company prior to the Effective Time.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee shall be given service
credit for all purposes, including for eligibility to participate, benefit
levels and eligibility for vesting under Acquiror employee benefit plans and
arrangements (collectively, the " _Acquiror Benefit Plans_ ") with respect to
his or her length of service with the Company (and its Subsidiaries and
predecessors) prior to the Closing Date, _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not result in the duplication of benefits and service credit shall not be
given for benefit accrual purposes under defined benefit pension plans and
retiree medical plans.

(c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after
the Effective Time Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cause each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all Acquiror Benefit Plans to the extent
coverage under such Acquiror Benefit Plan replaces, to the

 



53  extent that Acquiror deems it appropriate, coverage under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time; and (ii) for purposes of each Acquiror
Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits
to any Continuing Employee from and after the Effective Time, (A) cause all
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting periods and actively
at work requirements of such Acquiror Benefit Plan to be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting periods or actively at
work requirements were waived or satisfied under the comparable Company
Benefit Plan and (B) recognize, or cause to be recognized, any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year
prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account under such Acquiror
Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-
payment and maximum out of pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Acquiror Benefit Plan.

 

(d) The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 6.4_ are included for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto,
and that nothing in this _Section 6.4_, whether express or implied, (i) shall
create any third party beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other person,
including any employees or former employees of the Company or any Affiliate
of the Company, any Continuing Employee, or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof, or (B) to continued employment with Acquiror or any of its Affiliates
(including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), (ii)
shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit
Plan or Acquiror Benefit Plan, or (iii) shall limit the right of Acquiror or
its Affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan
or Acquiror Benefit Plan. The Company will notify Acquiror of receipt of any
notice of resignation of a Company Associate within five (5) days of
receipt thereof.

Section 6.5 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.5(b)_ and _Section 6.5(d)_, Acquiror, Merger Sub

promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to submit all notifications to and obtain all clearances,
authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities
that may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the
performance of its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement, (ii) cooperate
fully in promptly submitting all notifications and seeking to obtain all such
clearances, authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals, and (iii) provide
such other information to any Governmental Entity as such Governmental Entity
may reasonably request in connection herewith including responding to any
request for additional information or documentary material under the HSR Act
or Canada Competition Act as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each Party
agrees to make promptly (but in no event later than February 6, 2017, unless
otherwise mutually agreed to by the Parties) its respective filings, if
necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act and Canada Competition Act with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to supply as promptly as
practicable to the appropriate Governmental Entities any additional
information and documentary material that may be

 



54  requested pursuant to the HSR Act or Canada Competition Act. Each Party
agrees to make as promptly as practicable its respective filings and
notifications, if any, under any other applicable antitrust, competition,
foreign investment or trade regulation Law and to supply as promptly as
practicable to the appropriate Governmental Entities any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to
such applicable antitrust, competition, foreign investment or trade
regulation Law.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Acquirors and the Companys
undertakings pursuant to _Section 6.5(a)_ but subject to _Section 6.5(d)_,
Acquiror and the Company shall take any and all steps necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition, foreign
investment or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any antitrust or
competition Governmental Entity so as to enable the Parties hereto to close
the Merger as promptly as practicable including proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such of its
assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to
be acquired by it pursuant hereto, and the entrance into such other
arrangements, as are necessary or advisable in order to avoid the entry of, or
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as soon
as practicable; provided, that no Party hereto shall be required pursuant to
this _Section 6.5_ to commit to or effect any action that is not conditioned
upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, in the event that any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) by any Governmental Entity challenging the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Parties shall, and shall cause
its respective Affiliates to, in each case in accordance with and subject to
_Section 6.5(d)_, cooperate with each other in all respects and to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and defend on the merits any
claim asserted in court by any Governmental Entity in order to avoid entry of,
or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, Order or judgment (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing. Acquiror
shall be responsible for all filing fees and other similar fees required to be
paid in connection with obtaining any consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or making any declaration or filing with, any Governmental
Authority in connection with the discharge of the Parties obligations under
this _Section 6.5_.

(c) Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any communication
received from, or given by such Party or any of its Affiliates to, any
Governmental Entity or person relating to the matters that are the subject of
this Agreement (including any transactions permitted under _Section
6.1(a)(vii)_) and shall permit the other Party (and its advisors) to review in
advance any proposed communication by such Party (and its advisors) to any
Governmental Entity and shall consider in good faith the views of the other
Party in connection with any such proposed communication. None of the Parties
shall participate in any substantive meeting or conference (including with
respect to any transactions permitted under  _Section 6.1(a)(vii)_), whether
in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation (including any settlement of the investigation),
litigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other Party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the
other Party the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. The
Parties shall coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging
such information and providing such assistance as the other Party may
reasonably request in connection with the

 



55  foregoing. The Parties shall provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any transactions
permitted under _Section 6.1(a)(vii)_). Acquiror and the Company may, as
each deems advisable and necessary, (i) redact or remove references
concerning the valuation of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and (ii) reasonably designate any competitively sensitive or any confidential
business material provided to the other under this _Section 6.5(c)_ as
"counsel only" or, as appropriate, as "outside counsel only." This _Section
6.5(c)_ shall not apply with regard to Tax matters.

 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that Acquiror shall control and direct, and the
Company will cooperate reasonably, subject to applicable Law, with such
direction and control, regarding the filings (including where to file),
strategies, process, negotiation of settlements (if any), and related
proceedings contemplated by this _Section 6.5_, including for the avoidance
of doubt the marketing or sale of any part of the Companys, the Acquirors
or any of their respective Affiliates businesses or assets. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.5_, any reasonable actions or
strategies pursued by Acquiror (i) to avoid, resist or reduce the scope of
any action that may be sought or required to satisfy the conditions in
_Section 7.1(b)_ and _Section 7.1(c)_ or (ii) pertaining to the submission
of all required notifications to any Governmental Entity and obtaining the
consent of any Governmental Entity, shall be deemed consistent with its
obligations under this _Section 6.5_ so long as such action or strategy does
not delay satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII to a date
beyond the Outside Date, as the same may be extended to the Extended Outside
Date or Further Extended Outside Date, as applicable.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing, none of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall (and shall not direct any Practice Entity or
consent to any request from any Practice Entity to) acquire or license any
assets, businesses or securities of a third party if such acquisition or
license would or would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1(b)_ and _7.1(c)_.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Acquiror and use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause the delisting of
the Company Shares from NASDAQ by the Surviving Corporation as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company
Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such
delisting.

Section 6.6 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company Special Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement in preliminary form (and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to do so within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date of this
Agreement). Acquiror shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of
the Proxy Statement and furnish all information concerning Acquiror and
Merger Sub that is

 



56  required in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The
Company will respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC
or the staff of the SEC. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Proxy Statement, will be made by the Company without providing Acquiror and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the
Company shall reasonably consider all such comments in good faith. The
Company shall notify Acquiror as promptly as practicable of the receipt of any
comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of
any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply
Acquiror with copies of all correspondence between the Company and any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If, at any time prior to the Company Special
Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof), any information relating
to Acquiror or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers
or directors, is discovered by Acquiror or the Company that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy
Statement would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The Company
will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the resolution of any comments of the
SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement
(or confirmation of no comments to, or further review of, the preliminary
Proxy Statement by the SEC or the staff of the SEC) (such date, the "
_Clearance Date_ ") (and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days
following the Clearance Date).

 

(b) Subject to _Section 6.3(f)_, the Company shall take all action necessary
in accordance with applicable Laws and the Company Organizational Documents
to set a record date for, duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval
(the " _Company Special Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable following the
Clearance Date. The Company shall, subject to _Section 6.6(c)_, convene the
Company Special Meeting on or around the twentieth (20th) Business Day
following the commencement of the mailing of the Proxy Statement to its
stockholders. Except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.3_, the Company
Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) shall not make any Adverse
Recommendation Change and, unless the Company shall have made an
Adverse Recommendation Change if, and to the extent, permitted by this
Agreement, shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and
shall solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Company
Stockholder Approval at the Company Special Meeting.

(c) The Company shall cooperate with and keep Acquiror informed on a
reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting
results following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to its
stockholders. The Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting
only (i) if, as of the time which the Company Special Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares
of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum

 



57  necessary to conduct the business of the Company Special Meeting or to the
extent that at such time the Company has not received proxies sufficient to
allow receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) to allow time for the
filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure document
that the Company Board of Directors has determined, in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, is necessary or
required to be filed and disseminated under applicable Law, the Companys
certificate of incorporation or the Companys By-Laws or (iii) with the prior
written consent of Acquiror; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such
adjournment or postponement shall be for not more than the amount of time, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and after reasonably consulting with Acquiror and its outside
legal counsel), is necessary to comply with applicable Law or the Companys
certificate of incorporation or the Companys By-Laws, and, in any event,
shall not be to a date that is later than six (6) Business Days prior
to October 6, 2017. Any additional postponements or adjournments shall be by
mutual agreement of Acquiror and the Company. In no event will the record date
of the Company Special Meeting be changed without Acquirors prior written
consent, unless required by applicable Law. The Company shall, at the
instruction of Acquiror, postpone or adjourn the Company Special Meeting if
there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such
meeting to adopt this Agreement to allow reasonable time for the solicitation
of proxies for the purposes of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval.
During any such period of adjournment or postponement, the Company shall
continue to comply with its obligations under  _Section 6.3_ and this
_Section 6.6_. Without the prior written consent of Acquiror, the adoption of
this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and
matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Companys
stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the
Company Special Meeting.

 

(d) The Company shall solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, and unless the
Company Board of Directors has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure Company Stockholder
Approval at the Company Special Meeting. The Company shall cooperate with and
keep Acquiror informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its
solicitation efforts and voting results following dissemination of the
definitive Proxy Statement.

 

Section 6.7 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company shall not take any action that
would cause the Merger to be subject to requirements imposed by any takeover
statute. If any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or "business combination statute or
regulation" or other similar state anti-takeover Laws and regulations may
become, or may purport to be, applicable to the Merger, the Company shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



58 Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Acquiror and the Company. The Parties shall consult
with one another prior to issuing, and provide each other with the opportunity
to review and comment upon, any public announcement, statement or other
disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not issue
any such public announcement, statement or disclosure prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by Law, by the rules and regulations
of NASDAQ or in connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change (in which
case the Company shall provide to Acquiror a draft of such public announcement
or statement as far in advance as reasonably practicable); _provided_ , that
(w) each of the Company and Acquiror may make any public statements in
response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or analyst or investor
calls, so long as such statements are not inconsistent with previous
statements made jointly by the Company and Acquiror (or made by one Party
after having consulted with the other Party), (x) no public announcement or
statement or other disclosure shall be made in connection with an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless it is made in compliance with _Section 6.3_ and
(y) this _Section 6.8_ shall not apply to any disclosure of information
concerning this Agreement in connection with any dispute between the Parties
regarding this Agreement.

 

Section 6.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from Liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, and any rights to
advancement of expenses, existing as of the date hereof in favor of any person
who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, a director or officer of the Company or any of
the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (in each
case, when acting in such capacity or as a fiduciary of any Company Benefit
Plan) (collectively, together with their respective heirs, executors and
administrators, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the
Company Organizational Documents (or Company Subsidiary Organizational
Documents in effect as of the date hereof) or any indemnification agreements
in existence as of the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time of such Company Indemnified Parties. From and after the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation complies
with and honors the foregoing obligations.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold
harmless each Company Indemnified Party against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or
Liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of the fact that such person is
or was a director or officer of the Company, any of the Companys
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or, while serving as a
director or officer, is or was a fiduciary of any Company Benefit Plan and
pertaining to matters existing or occurring or actions or omissions taken
prior to or at the Effective Time, including with respect to this Agreement
and the Merger, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by the Company
Organizational Documents (or Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents), and
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Acquiror shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, also advance expenses to the Company Indemnified Parties as
incurred to the

 



59  fullest extent permitted by the Company Organizational Documents (or Company
Subsidiary Organizational Documents, as applicable); _provided_ , that the
Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a final
and non-appealable judicial determination that such Company Indemnified Party
is not entitled to indemnification under this  _Section 6.9_ or otherwise.
Neither Acquiror nor the Surviving Corporation shall, without the prior
written consent of the applicable Company Indemnified Party (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, for which such Company Indemnified Party
would reasonably be expected to be entitled to indemnification hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) does not require such
Company Indemnified Party to perform any covenant or refrain from engaging in
any activity and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission
of, fault, violation, culpability, malfeasance or nonfeasance by, or on behalf
of, such Company Indemnified Party. Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation
shall provide the applicable Company Indemnified Party with the opportunity
to participate in the defense of any matter for which such Company Indemnified
Party would reasonably be expected to be entitled to indemnification
hereunder. Acquirors and the Surviving Corporations obligations under this
_Section 6.9(b)_ shall continue in full force and effect for the period
beginning upon the Effective Time and ending six (6) years from the Effective
Time; _provided_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, asserted or made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, at the Companys option, the Company shall,
or, if the Company is unable to, Acquiror shall, cause the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for
the non-cancelable extension of the directors and officers liability
coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance
policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies
(collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case with respect to acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or
prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies as in effect as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ that the Company shall not pay an amount for the DandO Insurance in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such insurance for the policy period that includes the date
of this Agreement. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by either
the Company or the Surviving Corporation prior to or as of the Effective Time,
Acquiror shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect,
for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the
Surviving Corporation. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for
a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with the Companys
current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO 

 



60  Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement, or (ii) Acquiror will provide, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six
(6) years after the Effective Time, the Company Indemnified Parties who are
insured under the Companys DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that
provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger) from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier, that is no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company as
of the date of this Agreement or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an
aggregate premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance
for the policy period that includes the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger), for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified
Parties, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such individual may have under the Company
Organizational Documents (or Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents), by
Contract or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, following the Effective Time, no Party shall amend, or seek to
amend, this _Section 6.9_ (except to the extent such amendment permits the
Company to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis to
the Company Indemnified Parties).

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
Acquiror and/or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns or transferees of the
Surviving Corporation or Acquiror, as the case may be, expressly assume or
succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

Section 6.10 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any Partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Acquiror or the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other
Partys operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective
Time, each of the Company and Acquiror shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
its respective operations.

 



61 Section 6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Common Stock) resulting from the Merger by each individual who is subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to the Company (including each director and officer of the Company) to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law. The Company shall provide Acquiror with a
reasonable opportunity to review any resolutions or other documents in respect
of the actions described in this _Section 6.11_ and will implement any
reasonable comments that are timely provided by Acquiror in respect thereof.

Section 6.12 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section 6.12_ and the Debt
Financing Sources or other prospective lenders being subject to obligations
of confidentiality on customary terms for syndicated lending transactions,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, provide, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to provide, to Acquiror and its Affiliates (including Parent)
all cooperation that may be reasonably requested by Acquiror (including
reasonable requests of banks, initial purchasers, underwriters or other Debt
Financing Sources or their counsel) to assist Acquiror and its Affiliates
(including Parent) in the arrangement of any third party debt financing
(including providing reasonably available financial and other information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries for use in marketing and offering
documents and to enable Acquiror and its Affiliates (including Parent) to
prepare projections or _pro forma_ financial statements) for the purpose
of financing, directly or indirectly, the aggregate Merger Consideration, any
repayment or refinancing of debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries
contemplated by this Agreement or required in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and any other amounts required to be paid in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and all related
fees and expenses of the Acquiror or its Affiliates (the " _Debt Financing_ ")
(it being understood that the arrangement or receipt of any such financing is
not a condition to the Merger); _provided_ , that in no event shall the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries be in breach of this Agreement because of
(i) the failure to deliver, after use of reasonable best efforts to do so,
any financial or other information that is not currently readily available as
of the date hereof (or as of the date requested by Acquiror) or is not
otherwise prepared in the ordinary course of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries respective businesses and operations at the time requested by
Acquiror unless such failure to deliver any such information would result in
the information previously provided by, or on behalf of, the Company
containing an untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state any fact
necessary to prevent such information from being materially misleading or (ii)
the failure to obtain, after use of reasonable best efforts to do so, any
review of any financial or other information by accountants or the furnishing
of any reports or other information by accountants.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to provide,
or to cause its Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives to
provide, cooperation under this _Section 6.12_ that unreasonably interferes
with the ongoing business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Nothing
in this _Section 6.12_ shall require the Company or its Subsidiaries to (i)
bear any out-of-pocket cost or expense for which it has not received prior

  



62  reimbursement pursuant to _Section 6.12(c)_ or pay any fee in connection
with the Debt Financing, (ii) incur any liability in connection with the Debt
Financing prior to the Effective Time, (iii) enter into any binding agreement
or commitment that would be effective prior to the Effective Time and that
does not terminate without liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries upon
termination of this Agreement, or (iv) take any action that would (A) cause
any natural person serving as a director, manager, partner, officer, employee
or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal
liability or (B) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide
access to, or disclose, information that reasonably would be expected to
result in the waiver of any attorney-client, work product or other applicable
privilege or protection.

 

(c) Acquiror shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, (i)
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives in connection with their respective obligations
under this _Section 6.12_ and (ii) indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law from and against any and all
Liability suffered, sustained or incurred by, or asserted against, any of
them, directly or indirectly relating to, or arising out of, this _Section
6.12_, the arrangement of the Debt Financing or any alternative financing or
providing any of the information utilized in connection therewith, whether in
respect of direct claims, third-party claims or otherwise, other than to the
extent any of the foregoing arises from (A) the Willful Breach of the
obligations of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives under this _Section 6.12_ or any fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives or (B) material
misstatements or omissions in information provided by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the Debt
Financing or any alternative financing. The foregoing obligations in this
_Section 6.12(c)_ shall survive the Closing or, if earlier, the termination
of this Agreement. The provisions of this _Section 6.12(c)_ are (i) intended
to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Subsidiary of the
Company and its respective Representatives and, in the case of Representatives
who are natural persons, his or her heirs, executors and representatives.

Section 6.13 _Treatment of Certain Company Indebtedness_. 

(a) If requested by Acquiror, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to deliver all notices and take all other
reasonable actions required to facilitate (i) the termination of commitments
under that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2016 (as amended,
the " _Credit Agreement_ "), by and between the Company, certain of its
Subsidiaries as borrowers and guarantors, the lenders party thereto, Bank of
America, N.A., as administrative agent and the other parties thereto, (ii) the
repayment in full (or, in the case of letters of credit, cash
collateralization, to the extent Acquiror shall not have entered into an
alternative arrangement with the issuing bank) of all obligations then-
outstanding thereunder and (iii) the release of all Liens and guarantees in
connection therewith, in each case, on the Closing Date in connection with
such repayment (such termination, repayment and release, the " _Existing Loan
Agreement Termination_ "); _provided_ , that (A) in no event shall this
_Section 6.13(a)_ require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to cause
such Existing Loan Agreement Termination unless the Closing shall have
occurred and (B) Acquiror shall provide, or cause to be provided, all funds
required to effect all such repayments and cash collateralization of letters
of credit.

 



63 (b) On or prior to the second Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered by the
administrative agent under the Credit Agreement or the applicable
representative of the holders of such other Indebtedness, as the case may be,
to Acquiror an executed payoff letter (subject to delivery of funds as
arranged by Acquiror) with respect to the Credit Agreement and any other
Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Payoff
Letter_ "), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Acquiror and the
relevant Debt Financing Sources, each of which Payoff Letters shall (i)
indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all principal,
interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs and any other
monetary obligations then due and payable under the Credit Agreement or
agreement(s) governing such other Indebtedness, as applicable, as of the
anticipated Closing Date and per diem additional amounts due and payable if
such amount is not paid on the anticipated Closing Date (such amount payable
with respect to such Payoff Letter and Credit Agreement or agreement(s)
governing such other Indebtedness, as applicable, the " _Payoff Amount_ "),
(ii) state that upon receipt of the Payoff Amount under each such Payoff
Letter, the Credit Agreement and all related loan documents, or the
agreement(s) governing such other Indebtedness, as applicable, shall be
terminated (but excluding any contingent obligations,
including indemnification obligations or other obligations that, by their
terms, survive the termination of the Credit Agreement and the related loan
documents or the agreement(s) governing such other Indebtedness, as
applicable, that in any such case are not then-due and payable), (iii)
provide that all Liens and all guarantees in connection therewith relating to
the assets and properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries securing
such obligations shall be automatically released and terminated upon the
payment of each Payoff Amount on the Closing Date, (iv) provide authorizations
to file any Uniform Commercial Code termination statements, terminations and
releases of outstanding mortgages and security interests as are reasonably
necessary to release such Liens and (v) evidence that, upon the receipt of
payment of the Payoff Amount, all tangible collateral (including, without
limitation, all equity certificates and related transfers or assignments in
blank) securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement held in Bank of
America, N.A.s (or any of its Affiliates) possession shall be promptly

set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_ to fail to be satisfied. For the avoidance of
doubt, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.16(b)_ shall

Acquiror or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any

each case if and only to the extent that such inaccuracy, or such failure,
would reasonably be expected to cause the condition to the obligations of
Acquiror and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set
forth in _Section 7.3(b)_ to fail to be satisfied. For the avoidance of
doubt, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.16(c)_ shall
not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Acquiror
or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the
obligations of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this

full pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 8.3_, the Company

payment of the Termination Fee in connection with a termination of
this Agreement pursuant to which such Termination Fee is payable.

(e) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the payment of
the Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated

circumstances in which the Termination Fee is due and payable or reimbursable,
as applicable, and which do not involve fraud or Willful Breach of this
Agreement, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision. The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
Merger, and that, without these agreements, Acquiror and Merger Sub would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a
timely manner any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, then (i) the

expenses (including reasonable disbursements and fees of outside legal
counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in

of itself and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors,
officers and employees (in each case, in their respective capacities as such
and prior to the Closing of the Merger)) hereby waives any rights or
claims against any Debt Financing Source (in their capacity as such) in
connection with this Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at law or
equity, in Contract, in tort or otherwise. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is agreed that no Debt Financing
Source (in their capacity as such) shall have any liability for any claims,
losses, settlements, Liabilities, damages, costs, expenses, fines or penalties
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, officers, directors and employees
(in each case, with respect to such Subsidiaries, officers, directors and
employees prior to the Closing of the Merger) in connection with this
Agreement or the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated thereby.

any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument. Each Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party

specified in such notice or three (3) Business Days after the notice is
given, whichever is later. Rejection or other refusal to accept or the

relieve Parent, Acquiror or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the first sentence of this  _Section 9.8_, this Agreement shall
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted

Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

 

Section 9.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the exhibits
hereto, schedules hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the Parties, or any of them, with respect to

grant standing to any person other than the Parties hereto.

Section 9.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
the Company, Acquiror, and Merger Sub; _provided_ , that, without the further
approval of the stockholders of the Company and the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub, no such amendment or waiver shall be made or given after the Company
Stockholder Approval that requires the approval of the stockholders of the
Company or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub under the DGCL unless the
required further approval is obtained; _provided_ , _further_ , that this
further proviso to this first sentence of _Section 9.11_ and _Sections
8.3(f)_ ,  _9.4_ , _9.5(c)_ , _9.6_ and _9.13_ may not be amended or waived
in a manner adverse to the Debt Financing Sources without the prior written
consent of the Debt Financing Sources. At any time and from time to time prior
to the Effective Time, either the Company, on the one hand, or Acquiror and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, may, to the extent not prohibited by applicable
Law and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Acquiror or Merger
Sub, in the case of an extension by the Company, or of the Company, in the
case of an extension by Acquiror and Merger Sub, as applicable, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of any
such Party contained herein. The foregoing notwithstanding, no failure or
delay by any Party hereto in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

 



76 Section 9.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the Parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this

holders by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion), each of

material for purposes of this Agreement.

shall be excluded; if the day at the end of the period is not a Business Day,
then such period shall end on the close of the next immediately following
Business Day; (xiv) references in this Agreement to specific Laws or to

burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.15 _Guaranty_.

 

(a) Parent, in order to induce the Company to execute and deliver this
Agreement, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees (the
" _Guaranty_ ") each and every covenant, agreement and other obligation of
Acquiror and Merger Sub, including the due, punctual and full payment and
performance of Acquirors and Merger Subs (including their
permitted designees and assigns) obligations hereunder when due (and
including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with any breach of any of
Acquirors and Merger Subs representations, warranties or covenants herein),
subject to any and all limitations on Acquirors and Merger Subs covenants,
agreements and other obligations hereunder.

(b) This Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and performance, and not of
collection, and Parent acknowledges and agrees that this Guaranty is full and
unconditional, and no release or extinguishment of Acquirors and Merger Subs
and/or their respective designees or assigns Liabilities (other than in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement), whether by decree in any
bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, will affect the continuing validity and
enforceability of this Guaranty. Parent hereby waives (i) any right to
require the Company, as a condition of payment or performance by Parent of any
obligations of Acquiror or Merger Sub

 



78  hereunder, to proceed against Acquiror or Merger Sub or pursue any other
remedy whatsoever in the event that Acquiror or Merger Sub fails to perform
its obligations hereunder, and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded
by Law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties.

 

(c) Parent represents and warrants to the Company that (i) Parent is a
Delaware corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and has all requisite corporate power
and authority necessary to execute and deliver this Guaranty, and to perform
its obligations hereunder, (ii) the execution, delivery and performance
by Parent of this Guaranty have been approved by all requisite corporate
action, and (iii) no other action on the part of Parent is necessary to

in this _Section 9.15(c)_ and of Acquiror and Merger Sub expressly set forth
in _Article V_ , or in a certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement,

Acquiror or Merger Sub makes any express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to Parent, Acquiror, Merger Sub or with respect to any other
information provided to the Company or any of its Affiliates in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Without limiting in any way the foregoing Guaranty, but subject in all
respects to any and all limitations on Acquirors and Merger Subs covenants,
agreements and other obligations hereunder, Parent agrees to cause, and to
take all actions to enable, Acquiror and Merger Sub to adhere to each
provision of the Agreement which requires an act or omission on the part of
Acquiror or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates to cause or
enable Acquiror and Merger Sub to comply with their respective obligations
under this Agreement.
