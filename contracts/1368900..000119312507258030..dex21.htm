shall be payable quarterly); and may be prepaid at any time without penalty.
The Note will also provide that except pursuant to corporate credit
facilities, finance leases and purchase money security interests, GateHouse
Media will not grant any third party a position senior to that of Buyer as
the Note holder. The form of the Note, which shall be in accordance with the
above, unless agreed otherwise, will be agreed upon by Sellers and Buyer prior
to the Closing Date. 

1.5 _Manner of Payment_. The Cash Portion shall be paid to Sellers on the
Closing Date in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank
account or bank accounts designated by Sellers in writing at least two (2)
business days prior to the Closing Date. At the Closing, GateHouse Media shall
deliver the Note to Sellers.

1.6 _Adjustments_.

(a)  _Closing Date Working Capital Adjustment_. Sellers shall be entitled to
all income earned and collected and be responsible for all expenses incurred
in connection with the business and operation of the Publications on or prior
to the Closing Date. Buyer shall be entitled to all income earned and be
responsible for all expenses incurred in connection with the business and
operation of the Publications after the Closing Date. The Purchase Price is
subject to a further adjustment for working capital (the "Closing Date
Working Capital Adjustment") as determined in accordance with Section 1.6(c)
below. The Closing Date Working Capital Adjustment shall be an amount, as of
the Closing Date, equal to the dollar value of the current assets of the
Publications _less_ the dollar value of the current liabilities of the
Publications (including, but not limited to,  



 

9  accounts payable, prepaid advertising, unearned subscription revenue,
accrued salary, payroll and wages, vacation and sick pay, and similar items
with respect to New Employees (as defined in Section 10.5), and net of
Sellers reserves for uncollectible receivables established by Sellers in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, in each case only
to the extent included in the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities and
as set forth in the Closing Date Balance Sheet).

In computing the Closing Date Working Capital Adjustment, components of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet (as defined in Section 1.6(c)) shall be derived
from subsidiary ledgers maintained in accordance with Sellers historical
accounting practices which reflect accrual basis accounting and are utilized
by Morris Publishing in the preparation of consolidated financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States ("GAAP"). The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the notes to the Working Capital History set forth on
_Schedule 1.6(a)_ , each line item of which shall reflect components derived
from and prepared consistently with the methods used in the preparation of
Morris Publishings balance sheets which methods are used by Sellers in the
ordinary cause of business consistent with past practice and are in accordance
with GAAP ("Sellers Accounting Practices"). All intercompany and Affiliate
receivables or liabilities will be treated as shareholders equity and will be
excluded from the Closing Date Working Capital Adjustment and will not be
assumed by Buyer. All prepaid advertising and unearned subscription revenue
shall be accrued as liabilities in the amount of such prepayments.

(b) _Other Adjustments_. All items of income and expense directly relating to
the business of operating the Publications, other than the income and expenses
referred to above, shall be prorated between Sellers and Buyer as of the close
of business on the Closing Date. Such items to be prorated shall include,
without limitation, power and utility charges, personal property Taxes and
real property Taxes. The portion of any personal property Taxes and real
property Taxes for a taxable period that includes the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period") that shall be deemed to be payable for the portion of the
period ending on the Closing Date shall be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears
basis, the amount of such  



 

10  Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire period. The portion of any other item of income or expense for a
Straddle Period that shall be deemed to be payable for the portion of the
period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined based on an interim
closing of the books to the extent practicable and otherwise based on the
formula described in the immediately preceding sentence.

(c) _Adjustment Calculations_. Three (3) business days prior to the Closing
Date, to the extent practicable, the adjustments provided in this Section 1.6
shall be made to the Cash Portion of the Base Purchase Price on the basis of
the then most recently available financial statements of the Publications,
which shall be reflected on a preliminary balance sheet for the Publications
(the "Preliminary Balance Sheet") prepared by Sellers in accordance with
Sellers Accounting Practices. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
Sellers will prepare an adjusted balance sheet for the Publications (the
"Closing Date Balance Sheet") as of the close of business on the Closing Date,
reflecting the adjustments provided in this Section 1.6 and showing the
recalculation of adjustments reflected on the Preliminary Balance Sheet,
along with back-up materials necessary for Buyers understanding of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and Buyers confirmation of the calculations
thereof. Sellers and their accountants will provide Buyers accountants with
reasonable access to the books, records and working papers of Sellers
necessary to review such calculations. Within one-hundred fifty (150) days
after the Closing Date, final adjustments pursuant to this Section 1.6 and any
required refund or payment shall be made on the basis of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet (the "Adjustment Payment Date"), provided that if any amounts
are in dispute, the Adjustment Payment Date for the disputed amounts shall be
the date payment is required to be made as required below. If any dispute
arises over the amount to be refunded or paid, such refund or payment shall
nonetheless be promptly made to the extent such amount is not in dispute. If
Buyer does not notify Sellers within forty-five (45) days of receiving the
Closing Date Balance Sheet that Buyer disputes the information contained
therein, then Buyer shall be deemed to agree to the Closing Date Balance Sheet
and to have waived all further right to dispute the information contained
therein and its use in  



 

11  applying the provisions of this Agreement. If Buyer does notify Sellers of a
dispute regarding the Closing Date Balance Sheet within the forty-five (45)
day period of receiving the Closing Date Balance Sheet, and if such dispute
cannot be resolved by the parties within thirty (30) days thereafter, such
dispute shall be referred to a mutually satisfactory independent public
accounting firm of national stature which has not been employed by any of the
parties herein for the two (2) years preceding the Closing Date. If Buyer and
Sellers cannot agree upon an independent public accounting firm to perform the
valuation of the Acquired Assets, then Buyer and Sellers shall each select an
independent public accounting firm which firms shall select and engage an
independent public accounting firm to perform and prepare a written
determination of the adjustments or dispute between the parties. The
determination of such independent accounting firm shall be conclusive and
binding on each party and any required payment or refund in accordance
therewith shall be made in immediately available funds within ten (10) days
of such determination. The fees of such firm shall be shared equally by Morris
Publishing and Buyer.

1.7 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Buyer and Sellers shall reasonably
cooperate and, at the request of the other party, exchange information,
including copies of IRS Form 8594, regarding allocation of the Purchase Price
to the Acquired Assets. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Buyer and Sellers agree that the allocation of the Purchase Price attributable
to the Real Property shall be determined as follows. As soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement but in no event later than ten (10) days
after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and Sellers shall agree, and Sellers
shall engage an independent and mutually acceptable appraiser to perform and
prepare a written valuation of the Real Property. The cost of the
valuation prepared by an agreed appraiser shall be borne by Buyer. If Buyer
and Sellers cannot agree upon an independent appraiser to perform the
valuation of the Real Property, then Buyer and Sellers shall each select an
independent appraiser which appraisers shall select and engage an independent
appraiser to perform and prepare a written valuation of the Real Property. In
such event, the cost of the valuation shall be borne equally between Buyer and
Sellers. The written valuation shall be binding on and used by Buyer and
Sellers in allocating the Purchase Price to the Real Property. The entire
portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the Real Property shall be paid
from the Cash Portion of the Purchase Price.

and necessary action and execute all such documents or agreements as may be

ARTICLE III.

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS AND MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS_

Morris Communications and Sellers, jointly and severally represent and
warrant to Buyer and GateHouse Media that the statements contained in this
Article III are correct and complete as of the date of this Agreement and will
be correct and complete as of the Closing Date, except as may be set forth in
the disclosure schedules delivered pursuant hereto. Disclosure made in a
specific section or subsection of the disclosure schedules shall not be deemed
to have been made with respect to any other section or subsection herein
unless an explicit cross-reference appears in such disclosure schedule to
that effect or such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face.

3.1 _Organization; Qualification_. Each Seller is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
respective organization or incorporation. Each Seller has the full power and
authority to own and operate the Acquired Assets (excluding the Mastheads)
and carry on the business and operations of the Publications as are now being
conducted. Each Seller has the full power and authority to own the Masthead
and the Rights. Each Seller (a) is duly qualified to do business and in good
standing, and is duly licensed, authorized or qualified to transact business
in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or lease of real property or the
conduct of its business related to the Publications requires it to be so
qualified, and (b) has all Permits (as defined in Section 3.16) necessary to
own its properties and assets and carry on its business related to the
Publications as it is now being conducted, except in each case, for any
failures to be so qualified or licensed, or to have such Permits which would
not, individually, or in the aggregate have or be reasonably expected to have
a Material Adverse  



 

16  Effect (as defined in Section 3.4 hereof). Any applications for the renewal
of any such Permits related to the Publications that are due prior to
the Closing Date have been timely made or filed by Sellers prior to the
Closing Date. No proceeding to renew, suspend, modify, suspend, revoke,
withdraw, terminate or otherwise limit any such Permit related to the
Publications is pending or threatened. 

3.2 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Each of Morris Communications and
each Seller has the full power, authority and legal right to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions and perform its
obligations as contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action, and this Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Morris Communications and
Sellers and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer and
GateHouse Media, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Morris
Communications and Sellers enforceable against Morris Communications and
Sellers in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law affecting the rights of creditors
generally.

3.3 _Income Statements_. _Schedule 3.3_ sets forth (a) the
unaudited consolidated statement of income (before taxes and interest) of the
Publications for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and (b) unaudited
consolidated statement of income (before taxes and interest) of the
Publications for the period through June 30, 2007 (the "Income Statement
Date") (the financial statements referred to in clauses (a) and (b) being
"Income Statements"). Morris Publishing operates (and reports its financial
results) as a single operating segment. Accordingly, separate balance sheets,
income statements or other financial statements are not maintained for the
Publications as a group, or for any individual Publication. The Income
Statements were prepared, (i) specifically in contemplation of this
Agreement, (ii) following the guidance of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") for preparing full carve-out income statements (but
disregarding interest and taxes, as described in _Schedule 3.3), (iii)_ from
Morris Publishings consolidated statements of income, and (iv) on the accrual
basis in accordance with GAAP. _Schedule 3.3_ also sets forth a true and
complete line item reconciliation of such Income Statements to GAAP and to
the requirements for "carve out" financial statements. The Income Statements
reflect fees for management and shared services paid to Affiliates and
allocations of shared expenses based upon various factors (such as a
percentage of  



 

17  circulation, advertising revenue, total revenue, newsprint consumption or
employees) deemed by Morris Publishing as of the Income Statement Date to
be appropriate for such expenses, but no attempt has been made to determine
what such costs would have been if the Publications had been operated on a
stand-alone basis. Subject to the foregoing, the Income Statements fairly
present in all material respects the results of operations of the
Publications (before interest and taxes) for the periods covered thereby and
have been prepared in conformity with Sellers Accounting Practices. The
Working Capital History has been prepared in accordance with Sellers
Accounting Practices and consistent with past practice. Sellers shall deliver
on the Closing Date to Buyer a schedule of the Publications outstanding
accounts receivable as of the Closing Date. All such accounts receivable
have arisen in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and represent bona fide indebtedness incurred by the applicable account debtor
and have been properly adjusted for bankrupt and other uncollectible accounts
in accordance with Sellers Accounting Practices. Assuming reasonable
collection efforts by Buyer, Morris Communications and Sellers have no reason
to believe that such accounts receivable would not be collectible (net of
Sellers reserves for uncollectible receivables established by Sellers in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice).

3.4 _Business Since the Income Statement Date_. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.4_ , since the Income Statement Date, the business of the
Publications has been conducted in the ordinary course of business and in
substantially the same manner as it was before the Income Statement Date.
Since the Income Statement Date, there has been no change in the business,
condition (financial or otherwise), properties, operations or prospects of the
Publications or other event or occurrence which has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, operations,
properties, condition or prospects (financial or otherwise) of the
Publications taken as a whole ("Material Adverse Effect") as of the Closing
Date. 

3.5 _Non-Contravention; No Defaults_.

(a) Except as disclosed in _Schedule 3.5_ , the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Sellers and Morris Communications will not
(i) conflict with any provision of the governing documents of Morris
Communications or Sellers, (ii) result in a default (or give rise to any right
of termination, cancellation or acceleration), with notice or passage of time
or both, under or conflict with any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any Material Contract (as defined in Section 3.9), note,  



 

18  bond, mortgage or other instrument, obligation or agreement relating to the
business or operation of the Publications or to which any of the Acquired
Assets may be subject, except for any such defaults which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on Morris Communications
or Sellers ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii)
violate any law, statute, rule, regulation, order, injunction or decree of any
government or any agency, bureau, board, commission, court, department,
officer, official, employee, agent, political subdivision, tribunal or other
instrumentality of any government, whether federal, state, local or foreign
(each a "Governmental Authority") applicable to Sellers or any of the Acquired
Assets except for any such violations which would not individually or in the
aggregate, have, or be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
or a material adverse effect on Sellers ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (iv) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien of any nature whatsoever on any of the Acquired Assets.

(b) Except for the required consents with respect to the contracts referred
to in Section 3.9 and the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "Hart-Scott-Rodino Act"), neither
Morris Communications nor any Seller is required to submit any notice, report
or other filing with, or obtain any consent, approval or waiver from, any
Governmental Authority or any other third party in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, except for any such failure which would
not individually or in the aggregate have or be reasonably expected to have a
material adverse effect on Sellers ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

3.6 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Sellers have no obligation or liability
required to be reflected or reserved against in any of the Income Statements
in accordance with GAAP which is not fully reflected or reserved against in
such Income Statements except for liabilities which have arisen after the
Income Statement Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, liabilities disclosed in the disclosure schedules delivered pursuant
hereto, Excluded Liabilities and Taxes payable to Morris Communications
pursuant to Sellers Tax sharing agreement with Morris Communications as set
forth in Section 1.2(l).



 

19 3.7 _Licenses and Authorizations_. All Permits required to own the Acquired
Assets and to conduct the business of the Publications are held by Sellers
and are in full force and effect with no violations of any of them having
occurred except for any such violations which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have or be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. All such material Permits known by Sellers without further inquiry are
listed in _Schedule 3.7_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall update _Schedule
3.7_ to include all material Permits. Except as disclosed in _Schedule 3.7_,
no proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of Sellers, threatened, seeking
the suspension, revocation, modification, cancellation or limitation of any
such Permit and, to the knowledge of Morris Communications and Sellers, there
is no basis for taking any such action.

3.8 _Condition and Adequacy of the Acquired Assets; Title_. Except as
disclosed in _Schedule 3.8_ , the material tangible assets included in the
Acquired Assets, taken as a whole, are in adequate operating condition and
repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and are adequate and suitable in
accordance with general industry practices and applicable law for the
purposes for which they are currently used. Each of Sellers has good, valid
and marketable title to all of the Acquired Assets which such Seller purports
to own free and clear of all security interests, mortgages, conditional sales
agreements, charges, liens and other encumbrances (collectively, the "Liens"),
except for Permitted Encumbrances (as defined in Section 3.10(c) below). All
inventory of Sellers included in the Acquired Assets is useful in the
ordinary course of business and operation of the Publications and none of
which is slow-moving, obsolete, damaged or defective. Without limiting the
generality of any of the foregoing, except as indicated on  _Schedule 3.8_ ,
Sellers do not use furniture, fixtures, equipment, inventory or supplies in
connection with the operation of the Publications which they do not own.
Except for the Excluded Assets or as indicated on _Schedule 3.8_ ,
the Acquired Assets are, in the aggregate, all of the assets which are
necessary to operate the Publications in the manner in which the Publications
were operated during the 12-month period ending on the Income Statement Date
and since such time, except for additions thereto and deletions therefrom in
the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice. No asset
primarily used in the Publications or the Acquired Assets is located in Morris
Communications corporate headquarters or at any location not included in the
Acquired Assets.



 

20 3.9 _Contracts and Arrangements_. _Schedule 3.9_ lists the following written,
oral, implied or other agreements, contracts, understandings, arrangements,
instruments, notes, guaranties, indemnities, representations, warranties,
deeds, assignments, powers of attorney, certificates, purchase orders, work
orders, insurance policies, benefit plans, commitments, covenants, assurances
and undertakings of any nature relating primarily to the Publications or the
Acquired Assets (collectively, the "Material Contracts"), to which any of
Sellers is a party:

(a) Sales agency or advertising representation contracts involving annual
consideration of more than $100,000;

(b) Contracts for the future construction or purchase of capital improvements,
purchase of materials, supplies or equipment, or for the sale of assets
involving annual consideration of more than $100,000;

(c) Consulting contracts, employment agreements or freelance agreements
involving annual consideration of more than $100,000;

(d) Licenses or agreements involving annual consideration of more than
$100,000 under which Sellers are authorized to publish materials supplied by
others in future issues of the Publications;

(e) Leases or subleases of Real Property (collectively, the "Real Property
Leases");

(f) Leases of any personal property involving annual consideration of more
than $100,000;

(g) All contracts which are licenses and sublicenses (in which any of Sellers
is licensor or licensee) involving annual consideration of more than $100,000;

(h) Any contract for the purchase or sale of products, or other personal
property, or for the furnishing or receipt of services, involving annual
consideration of more than $100,000;

(i) Any contract concerning a partnership or joint venture;

(j) Any contract under which Sellers have created, incurred, assumed, or
guaranteed any indebtedness for borrowed money or pursuant to which Sellers
have advanced or loaned money;

(k) Any contract with any Affiliates of Sellers, or any entity in which
any Affiliates of Sellers holds an equity or any other economic interest;



 

21 (l) Any contract concerning non-disclosure, confidentiality or
noncompetition; 

(m) Any contract under which the consequences of a default or termination
could have an effect on the business, financial condition, operations,
results of operations, or future prospects of any of Sellers in an amount in
excess of $100,000; or

(n) Any other contract (or group of related contracts) the performance of
which involves consideration in excess of $100,000, or cannot be terminated
without penalty, payment or breach on ninety (90) days or less notice.

_Schedule 3.9_ also specifies those Material Contracts, the assignment of
which requires the consent of a third party. Provided that any
requisite consent to the assignment of Material Contracts to Buyer is
obtained, each of the contracts and leases which is assigned to and assumed by
Buyer on the Closing Date is valid and in full force and effect. There is no
existing default, event of default or other event under such Material
Contracts which, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or an event of default by Sellers under any such
contract. To the knowledge of Seller, there is not, under any of the Material
Contracts, any existing default or event of default which, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default or event of default
on the part of any other party thereto. Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers
will make available to Buyer true, correct and complete copies (or written
summaries of oral contracts) of all of the Material Contracts.

3.10  _Real Property_.

(a) All of the real property owned by Sellers and used primarily in the
business and operation of the Publications is identified on _Schedule
3.10(a)_ , together with all buildings, structures, residences, fixtures,
landscaping, utility lines, roads, driveways, fences, parking areas,
contiguous and adjacent entry rights, construction in progress, and all other
improvements to such real property that are owned by Sellers or any Affiliate,
located in and upon such real property, and used primarily in the business and
operation of the Publications, together with all rights, privileges, and
easements appurtenant to the foregoing (all of the foregoing collectively
referred to as the "Owned Real Property");

(b) _Schedule 3.10(b)_ sets forth a complete and accurate list of all
leasehold interests of Sellers used primarily in the business and operation of
the Publications (the "Leased Real Property"). The Leased Real Property and
the Owned Real Property are collectively referred to as the "Real Property".



 

22 (c) Good and marketable fee title to each parcel of Owned Real Property
disclosed on  _Schedule 3.10(a)_ is owned by Sellers set forth on such
schedule, free and clear of any Liens, easements, rights-of-way, licenses, use
restrictions, claims, charges, options, rights of first offer, rights of first
refusal or title defects, of any nature whatsoever, except for Permitted
Encumbrances (as defined below). As used in this Agreement, the term
"Permitted Encumbrances" means (i) Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable;
(ii) Liens for Taxes which are being contested in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings in the amount of which a reserve has been created and
set forth on the Closing Date Balance Sheet; (iii) carriers, warehousemens,
mechanics, materialmens, repairmens or other like Liens arising in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or which are being
contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings in the amount of which
a reserve has been created on the Closing Date Balance Sheet (which reserve
under clauses (ii) or (iii) shall, to the extent Sellers are successful in
finally, definitively and irrevocably contesting any such Liens and Buyer
effectively gets the benefit thereof, will upon written notice and delivery
of satisfactory proof thereof, be refunded to Sellers); (iv) easements,
rights-of-way, encroachments, licenses, restrictions, conditions and other
similar encumbrances which do not materially interfere with the current

5.2 _Organization; Goodwill_. Sellers shall use its reasonable efforts to
preserve the business organization of the Publications intact and preserve
the goodwill of the Publications suppliers, customers and others having
business relations with them.

5.3 _Access to Facilities, Files and Records_. At the reasonable request of
Buyer and subject to the need to preserve the confidentiality of this
transaction prior to Closing in order to preserve relationships with employees
and customers, Sellers and Morris Communications shall give or cause to be
given to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and authorized
representatives of Buyer (a) access after prior notice during normal business
hours to all Facilities, property, accounts, books, minute books, deeds,
title papers, licenses, agreements, contracts, Tax Returns (other than Federal
and State income Tax Returns), records and files of every character,
equipment, machinery, fixtures, furniture, vehicles, notes and accounts
payable and receivable and inventories primarily related to the Publications,
and (b) all such other information concerning the Acquired Assets and affairs
of the Publications as Buyer may  



 

39  reasonably request. With the consent and supervision of Sellers, Sellers and
Morris Communications shall permit representatives of Buyer to
perform inspections of the Real Property and the structures located thereon
and to perform surveys, environmental assessments, sampling and audits as
Buyer may request with respect to the Acquired Assets.

5.4 _Representations and Warranties_. Sellers and Morris Communications shall
give detailed written notice to Buyer and GateHouse Media promptly upon the
occurrence of or becoming aware of the impending or threatened occurrence of
any event which would cause or constitute a breach, or would have caused a
breach had such event occurred or been known to Sellers or Morris
Communications prior to the date hereof, of any of Sellers or Morris
Communications representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or
in any schedule delivered pursuant hereto. Buyer and GateHouse Media shall
give detailed written notice to Sellers promptly upon becoming aware of any
inaccuracy in any of the representations or warranties in Article III or any
other breach of this Agreement, which notice shall not waive or otherwise
limit any of GateHouse Medias or Buyers rights or remedies hereunder. From
time to time on or prior to the Closing, Sellers and Morris Communications
shall supplement or amend any schedules delivered in connection herewith with
respect to any matter arising after the date hereof, which, if arising prior
to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such schedule or which is necessary to correct any information in
such schedule which has been rendered inaccurate as a result of a
matter arising after the date hereof and such amendment shall not be deemed
to create a breach of any representation or warranty.

5.5  _Corporate Action_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Sellers
and Morris Communications will take all necessary action required of them to
carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.6 _Consents_.

(a) Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or cause to be
obtained prior to the Closing Date consents to the assignment to or assumption
by Buyer of all of the Material Contracts which require the consent of any
third party by reason of the transactions provided for in this Agreement as
shown on _Schedule 3.9_ and _Schedule 3.10(b)_ ; provided, however, that
Sellers shall not be required to make any payments or to incur any obligations
to third parties in connection with the obtaining of any such consent.



 

40 (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a condition to Closing or
to constitute or require the transfer or assignment or the attempt to
transfer or assign any of the Acquired Assets if the attempted transfer or
assignment thereof, without the consent of a third party, would adversely
affect in any way the rights of any of Sellers or Morris Communications, on
the one hand, or Buyer or GateHouse Media, on the other hand or, in Buyers
opinion, would adversely affect any of the Publications or the Acquired
Assets. If any such consent shall not have been obtained at or prior to the
Closing, or the attempted transfer or assignment of any of the Acquired Assets
at the Closing would have an adverse effect on Sellers or Morris
Communications, on the one hand, or Buyer, GateHouse Media, the
Publications or the Acquired Assets on the other hand, or on Buyers rights
thereto or Buyer would not in fact receive the rights thereto, (i) Sellers
will cooperate with Buyer in any reasonable arrangement designed to provide
for Buyer the rights thereto and benefits thereunder, including, without
limitation, (A) enforcing for the benefit of Buyer any or all rights of
Sellers under any contract, commitment or other agreement against any other
party thereto, or (B) at Buyers election, not transferring, conveying,
assigning or delivering to Buyer at the Closing, and retaining legal title to
such Acquired Asset, while permitting Buyer the possession and use of such
Acquired Asset for Buyers account and with Buyer receiving the benefits and
bearing the burdens of such Acquired Asset as if such Acquired Asset had been
so transferred, conveyed, assigned and delivered, and (ii) Sellers will take
all reasonable appropriate further action to obtain such consents, approvals
or novations as may be required under applicable laws or otherwise to effect
the transfer or assignment of such Acquired Asset to Buyer. Pending the
obtaining of such consents, approvals or novations, Buyer will
continue performance of any remaining unfulfilled obligations of Sellers
under any contract, commitment or other agreement constituting such an
Acquired Asset in the same manner as though Buyer rather than Sellers was a
party to such contract, commitment or agreement, with Buyer receiving the
benefits and bearing the burdens thereof. Sellers agree to remit to Buyer all
collections received in respect of any such Acquired Asset promptly on receipt
thereof less any amount due Sellers from Buyer  



 

41  with respect to such Acquired Assets. Expenses incurred in connection with
actions taken pursuant to this Section 5.6(b) shall be borne in such a
manner as to place Sellers and Buyer in the economic positions in which they
would have been had such Acquired Asset been transferred, conveyed, assigned
or delivered at Closing.

5.7 _Confidential Information_. If for any reason the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement are not consummated, none of Sellers nor
Morris Communications shall disclose to third parties any information
designated as confidential and received from Buyer, GateHouse Media or their
respective agents in the course of investigating, negotiating and completing
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing shall be deemed to
be confidential information with respect to the preceding sentence which: (a)
is known to Sellers or Morris Communications at the time of its disclosure to
it; (b) becomes publicly known or available other than through disclosure by
Sellers or Morris Communications; (c) is rightfully received by Sellers from a
third party not known by Sellers or Morris Communications to be subject to an
obligation of confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by Sellers
or Morris Communications. If for any reason the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement are not consummated, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement dated July 19, 2007 shall continue to
apply to all confidential information.

5.8 _Consummation of Agreement_. Subject to the provisions of Section 10.2 of
this Agreement, Sellers and Morris Communications shall use reasonable efforts
to fulfill and perform all conditions and obligations on their part to be
fulfilled and performed under this Agreement and to cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be fully carried out.

5.9 _Notice of Proceedings_. Sellers and Morris Communications will promptly
notify Buyer in writing upon becoming aware of any order or decree or any
complaint praying for an order or decree restraining or enjoining the
consummation of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder, or
upon receiving any notice from any Governmental Authority of its intention to
institute an investigation into, or institute any action or proceeding to
restrain or enjoin consummation of this Agreement or such transactions, or to
nullify or render ineffective this Agreement or such transactions if
consummated.

5.10 _Interim Financial Statements_. Sellers and Morris Communications shall
deliver to Buyer and GateHouse Media unaudited interim balance sheets and
statements of income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the
Publications promptly but not later than  



 

42  twenty (20) days after the close of each of the Publications periodic
accounting periods (and in no event less frequently than on a monthly basis),
if any, that occurs between the Income Statement Date and the Closing Date.
Such interim periodic financial statements shall include financial information
both for the current accounting period and for the fiscal year to date, as
well as comparisons with the respective corresponding periods in the prior
fiscal year.

5.11 _Taxes_. Sellers shall pay all Taxes relating to the Publications or the
Acquired Assets as they become due.

5.12 _Audited Financial Statements; Interim Financial Statements_. If
and when requested by Buyer, Sellers and Morris Communications will, within
60 days of Closing provided such request is made by November 1, 2007, cause to
be delivered to Buyer an audit of the Publications financial statements for
up to the three years ending December 31, 2006 and interim financial
statements of Publications as required by financial reporting standards
affecting Buyer or GateHouse Media. Buyer shall pay Sellers reasonably
incurred and necessary incremental third party costs and expenses for such
audit. It is understood that Sellers shall not be responsible for any delays
to the extent caused by the outside auditors provided Sellers and Morris
Communications use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly and fully
cooperate with such auditors and timely comply with their requests.

5.13 _Title Matters_.

(a) Within five (5) days after the date of this Agreement, Sellers and Morris
Communications will provide Buyer with copies of all title information in the
possession of Sellers or Morris Communications, any of their respective
Affiliates, or their respective agents relating to the Owned Real Property,
including abstracts of title, surveys and policies of title insurance. 

(b) Within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer will
obtain title commitments for a 2006 ALTA Owners Title Insurance Policy or
Policies with respect to the Owned Real Property (each a "Title Commitment"),
issued by a title company reasonable acceptable to Buyer and its lenders (the
"Title Company"), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and
its lenders. Each Title Commitment will be accompanied by readable copies of
all documents cited as exceptions to title therein (the "Underlying
Documents"), which will be certified by the Title Company as true, correct
and complete copies of the Underlying Documents. Buyer, at its option,  



 

43  may obtain survey maps of the Owned Real Property (each a "Survey")
acceptable to the title insurance company providing the Title
Commitments, prepared and certified in accordance with generally accepted
professional standards by a duly licensed land surveyor, dated after the date
of this Agreement. Buyer shall provide Sellers with legible copies of the
Title Commitments, exception documents and other instruments referenced
therein and survey maps, if any, promptly following Buyers receipt thereof.
Buyer will bear all costs of any surveys and the costs of such Title
Commitments and any title policies issued pursuant to the Title Commitments.

(c) Buyer will have twenty (20) days after its receipt of a Title Commitment
and the related Survey to review each of them and to notify Sellers in
writing of any exceptions other than exceptions to the Title Commitment to
which Buyer reasonably objects, other than Permitted Encumbrances (the "Title
Objections"). If prior to Closing any Title Objection or other Lien is
asserted against any of the Owned Real Property by, through or under Sellers
or any of their Affiliates that is not a Permitted Encumbrance, Sellers and
Morris Communications will, at their sole expense, either (i) obtain the
release of such Title Objection or Lien, (ii) obtain title insurance covering
such Title Objection or Lien, (iii) provide alternative arrangements,
satisfactory to Buyer in its sole discretion, which provide Buyer the full
economic benefit of the ownership of the affected Owned Real Property without
any of the risk associated with or relating to such Title Objections or Lien
or (iv) remove such particular parcel of the Owned Real Property from
the Acquired Assets being transferred upon written notice to Buyer, and with
an equitable adjustment to the Purchase Price in accord with the agreed upon
allocation of Purchase Price described in Section 1.7 If Sellers fail to cure
or address, prior to Closing, all Title Objections with respect to any
particular parcel of the Owned Real Property as provided above, then Buyer may
either (A) consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding
the Title Objections, with an equitable adjustment to the Purchase Price
described in Section 1.7 or (B) terminate this Agreement.

(d) Any matters shown on a Title Commitment or Survey to which Buyer does not
object during the twenty (20) day period set forth in Section 5.13(c), or to
which any Title Objection is waived by Buyer, will become Permitted
Encumbrances. 



 

44 5.14. _Buyer s Representations and Warranties_. Buyer and GateHouse Media
shall give detailed written notice to Sellers promptly upon the occurrence of
or becoming aware of the impending or threatened occurrence of any event which
would cause or constitute a breach, or would have caused a breach had such
event occurred or been known to Buyer and GateHouse Media prior to the date
hereof, of any of the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in
this Agreement.

5.15  _Corporate Action_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, each
of Buyer and GateHouse Media, on one hand, and Sellers and Morris
Communications, on the other hand, will take all necessary corporate and other
action required of them to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

5.16 _Consummation of Agreement_. Subject to the provisions of Section 10.2

contemplated by this Agreement to be fully carried out.

5.17 _Notice of Proceedings_. Buyer and GateHouse Media will promptly notify
Sellers in writing upon becoming aware of any order or decree or any complaint
praying for an order or decree restraining or enjoining the consummation of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder, or upon
receiving any notice from any Governmental Authority of its intention to
institute an investigation into, or institute any action or proceeding to
restrain or enjoin the consummation of this Agreement or such transactions, or
to nullify or render ineffective this Agreement or such transactions if
consummated.

5.18 _No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals_. Except following a termination
in accordance with Section 10.2, Morris Communications and Sellers agree that
they will not, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director,
employee, partner, stockholder, agent, or Affiliate or otherwise, except in
furtherance of the transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement
(a) solicit, initiate, or encourage submission of proposals or offers from any
person relating to any transactions of the type contemplated herein or to the
direct or indirect purchase of any of the Acquired Assets, the Publications
(collectively, an "Acquisition Proposal"), (b) participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any information with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with or assist, facilitate, or
encourage, any Acquisition Proposal by any person, (c) enter into any
agreement, arrangement,  



 

45  or understanding with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or (d) sell,
transfer, or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any agreement, arrangement,
or understanding with respect to, any interest in the Acquired Assets.

5.19 _Phase I Environmental Site Assessment_. Buyer may obtain Phase I
Environmental Reports (prepared in accordance with ASTM standards) for the
Real Property certified to Buyer and prepared by independent consultants
approved by Buyer ("Real Property Phase I Reports"), the results of which
shall be satisfactory to Buyer in its sole discretion, subject to the
remainder of this Section 5.19. Sellers and Morris Communications shall fully
cooperate with Buyer and Buyers representatives and exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all third parties to fully cooperate with Buyer
and Buyers representatives in obtaining the Real Property Phase I Reports.
Upon Buyers review of the Real Property Phase I Reports, Buyer shall notify
Sellers in writing of any matters set forth therein to which Buyer reasonably
object or has concerns (the "Environmental Objections"). Sellers may cure
prior to Closing, at their sole expense, all of the Environmental Objections,
to the sole satisfaction of Buyer either by (i) the remediation/repair of
such Environmental Objections, (ii) the procurement of insurance endorsements
for the benefit of GateHouse Media and Buyer providing full and complete
coverage against loss or damage as a result of such Environmental Objections,
(iii) providing alternative arrangements, satisfactory to Buyer in its sole
discretion, providing Buyer the full economic benefit of the ownership of the
affected Owned Real Property without any of the risk associated with or
relating to such Environmental Objections or (iv) remove such particular
parcel of the Owned Real Property from the Acquired Assets being transferred
upon written notice to Sellers, and with an equitable adjustment to
the Purchase Price in accord with the agreed upon allocation of Purchase
Price described in Section 1.7. If Sellers fail to cure or address, prior to
Closing, all Environmental Objections with respect to any particular parcel of
the Owned Real Property as provided above, then Buyer, in its sole discretion
may either (A) consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
notwithstanding the Environmental Objections, with an equitable adjustment to
the Purchase Price described in Section 1.7 or (B) terminate this Agreement.

parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the sole and exclusive remedy of the
parties, as the case may be, from and after the Closing Date with respect to
any Loss and Expense whatsoever and any and all claims for breach or
liability under this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be solely in accordance with, and limited by, the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Agreement.



 

52 9.2 _Indemnification of Buyer and GateHouse Media_. Morris Communications and
Sellers, jointly and severally agree to indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and
GateHouse Media harmless from and against any and all damages, claims, losses,
expenses, costs, fines, penalties, obligations and liabilities, including
without limitation, liabilities for reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements net of the benefit of Tax deductions and insurance claims
(collectively, "Loss and Expense"), suffered directly or indirectly by Buyer
and/or GateHouse Media by reason of, or arising out of:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Morris Communications
or Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, in each case as read without regard to
any materiality qualifiers or references to material adverse effect if any
single Loss or Expense (or series of related Losses or Expenses in the
aggregate) exceeds $50,000 (the "Materiality Threshold"), in which case Buyer
and GateHouse Media shall be indemnified from the first dollar of such Loss or
Expense; provided however that the Materiality Threshold shall not apply where
there are no such qualifiers or references; 

(b) any failure by Morris Communications or any of Sellers to perform or
fulfill any of their covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, in
each case as read without regard to any materiality qualifiers or references
to material adverse effect if any single Loss or Expense (or series of related
Losses or Expenses in the aggregate) exceeds the Materiality Threshold, in
which case Buyer and GateHouse Media shall be indemnified from the first
dollar of such Loss or Expense; provided however that the Materiality
Threshold shall not apply where there are no such qualifiers or references;

(c) any failure by Morris Communications or any of Sellers to pay or perform
when due any of their liabilities or obligations arising out of or related to
the business and operation of the Publications on or prior to the Closing Date
which have not been assumed by Buyer hereunder, including, but not limited to,
the Excluded Liabilities;

(d) any litigation, proceeding or claim by any third party relating to the
business or operations of the Publications on or prior to the Closing Date
which have not been expressly assumed by Buyer;

(e) the Excluded Assets; or



 

53 (f) any liability, including but not limited to any liability pursuant to
any Environmental Law, arising from or related to conditions or events that
occurred prior to the Closing arising from or related to the ownership of the
Real Property and/or the operations of the Publications on the Real Property
on or prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that Morris
Communications and Sellers shall have no liability pursuant to (i) any changes
in use of the Real Property after the Closing Date which trigger clean-up
standards that are more stringent than the clean-up standards applicable
based on the use of the Real Property as of the Closing Date and any
reasonably foreseeable or related uses and (ii) any changes in Environmental
Laws after the Closing Date which result in clean-up standards that are more
stringent than the clean-up standards applicable as of the Closing Date with
respect to the uses of the Real Property as of the Closing Date and any
reasonably foreseeable or related uses.

9.3 _Indemnification of Sellers and Morris Communications_. Buyer and
GateHouse Media, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify, defend and
hold Sellers and Morris Communications harmless from and against any and all
Loss and Expense suffered directly or indirectly by such Sellers and/or Morris
Communications by reason of, or arising out of:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer or GateHouse
Media pursuant to this Agreement;

(b) any failure by Buyer or GateHouse Media to perform or fulfill any of their
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or the Note;

(c) any failure by Buyer or GateHouse Media to pay or discharge on or
subsequent to the Closing Date any Assumed Liabilities hereunder or any
liabilities or obligations arising out of or related to the business of the
Publications incurred or first required to be performed by Buyer or GateHouse
Media after the Closing Date;

(d) any litigation, proceeding or claim by any third party relating to the
business or operation of the Publications after the Closing Date; or

(e) claims made by New Employees with respect to termination of employment by
Buyer after the Closing Date, including, but not limited to, any claims for
improper termination or severance payments.

9.4 _Notice of Claims_. If any party to the Agreement believes that it has
suffered or incurred any Loss and Expense, it shall notify the other
party(ies) promptly in writing and within  



 

54  the applicable time period specified in Section 9.1, describing such Loss
and Expense, the amount thereof, if known, and the method of computation
of such Loss and Expense, all with reasonable particularity and containing a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such Loss
and Expense shall have occurred; provided, however, that the amount of the
Loss and Expense set forth in the notice shall not be a limitation on any
claim for the actual amount of such Loss and Expense.

9.5 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. If any action at law or suit in equity
is instituted by a third party (a "Claim") with respect to which any of the
parties intends to claim a Loss and Expense under this Article IX, such party
shall promptly notify the indemnifying party(ies) of such action or suit. The
indemnifying party(ies) shall have the right to conduct and control any Claim
through counsel of its own choosing, but the indemnified party may, at its
election, participate in the defense of any such Claim at its sole cost and
expense. If the indemnifying party(ies) does not notify the indemnified party
within 10 days after receipt of the notice specified in this Section 9.5 that
it is defending any such Claim, then the indemnified party may defend such
Claim, and settle such Claim, through counsel of its own choosing, and recover
from the indemnifying party the amount of any such settlement or of any
judgment and the costs and expenses of such defense, including, but not
limited to, reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure by a party to abide by these terms
and conditions shall not affect the other partys obligations to indemnify
such party against Loss and Expense under this Article IX, except to the
extent the indemnifying party(ies) is actually prejudiced thereby.

ARTICLE X.

_MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_

10.1 _Risk of Loss_. The risk of any loss, damage or destruction to any of the
Acquired Assets to be transferred to Buyer hereunder from any cause shall be
borne by Sellers at all times prior to the Closing hereunder. Upon the
occurrence of any loss or damage in excess of $100,000 to any of the Acquired
Assets to be transferred hereunder prior to the Closing, Sellers shall notify
Buyer of same in writing immediately stating with particularity the extent of
the loss or damage incurred, the cause thereof if known and the extent to
which restoration, replacement  



 

55  and repair of the Acquired Assets lost or destroyed will be reimbursed under
any insurance policy with respect thereto. In the event the loss
exceeds $1,000,000 and the Acquired Assets cannot be substantially repaired
or restored within ninety (90) days after such loss, or, without regard to the
amount or duration of such loss, if production of any publication is
interrupted for three (3) consecutive days resulting in a loss or expected
loss of revenues following the Closing Date of $1,000,000 or more, Buyer shall
have the option, exercisable by giving written notice to Sellers within 30
days after such loss, to:

 

(a) Accept alternative arrangements proposed by Sellers to provide Buyer the
full economic benefit of the ownership of the effected Acquired Assets or
Publications;

(b) Remove such particular Acquired Assets or the entire Publication with an
equitable adjustment to the Purchase Price, in an amount subject to the
reasonable consent of Sellers;

(c) If such loss is a Material Adverse Event, either:

(i) Terminate this Agreement unless the parties can agree to an equitable
adjustment to the Purchase Price;

(ii) Postpone the Closing until such time as the Acquired Assets have been
substantially repaired, replaced or restored; or

(d) Elect to consummate the Closing and accept the Acquired Assets in their
"then" condition, in which event Sellers shall assign to Buyer all rights
under any insurance claim covering the loss and pay over to Buyer any proceeds
under any such insurance policy thereto received by Sellers with respect
thereto.

10.2 _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated by Sellers
or Buyer at any time prior to the Closing Date:

(a) By the mutual consent of the parties hereto;

(b) Subject to extension under Section 7.2(b), by Sellers and Morris
Communications if any of the conditions provided in Article VII hereof has
not been timely met and cannot be met on or before December 31, 2007 (in each
case other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by Sellers or Morris
Communications) and has not been waived, provided Sellers or
Morris Communications is not then in material breach of this Agreement;



 

56 (c) Subject to extension under Section 8.2(b), by Buyer and GateHouse Media if
any of the conditions provided in Article VIII hereof has not been timely met
by and cannot be met on or before December 31, 2007 (in each case other than
as a result of a breach of this Agreement by Buyer or GateHouse Media) and has
not been waived, provided Buyer or GateHouse Media is not then in material
breach of this Agreement;

(d) As provided in Sections 1.4, 5.13, 5.19 or 10.1;

(e) By Buyer if any amendment, update or supplement made by Sellers and/or
Morris Communications after the date hereof to the Schedules delivered to
them by or on behalf of Seller pursuant to this Agreement or any materials
supplementally delivered by or on behalf of Sellers and/or Morris
Communications discloses any facts or circumstances which, individually or in
the aggregate, which have, or may be reasonably expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect; or

(f) By either Buyer or Sellers if the Closing has not occurred prior to April
1, 2008 and the other Party has not provided notice of an intention to pursue
a claim for a breach of this Agreement by the terminating Party.

10.3 _Liabilities Upon Termination_. In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 10.2 above, no party hereto shall have any liability to
any other party for costs, expenses, damages, loss of anticipated profits or
otherwise, unless the termination occurs because of a willful and intentional
breach by such party.

10.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby will be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses. Any sales
or use Taxes or recording or transfer Taxes or fees directly related to
transferring the Acquired Assets to Buyer ("Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by
Buyer. The cost of title insurance for the Real Property purchased by Buyer
hereunder shall be paid by Buyer.

10.5 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

(a) Buyer hereby agrees to offer employment, effective the day after the
Closing Date, to all individuals who are, on the Closing Date, active, full
or part-time Publication Employees (including employees on short-term leave).
With respect to each such Publication Employee to whom Buyer offers
employment, Buyer shall offer to employ such person at a rate of total
compensation substantially similar as that which was  



 

57  paid to such Publication Employee immediately prior to Closing. Each
Publication Employee of Sellers who accepts employment with Buyer on the
Closing Date is hereinafter referred to as a "New Employee".

(b) Except as set forth in subsection (a) above, Buyer, in its sole
discretion, shall determine what employee benefits will be made available to
New Employees; provided, however, that Buyer (i) will offer medical coverage
to New Employees immediately after the Closing Date; (ii) shall waive for
New Employees, to the extent permitted by Buyers health plans, any pre-
existing condition limitations and waiting periods that may apply under such
health plans; and (iii) shall recognize New Employees service with Sellers or
any of their respective Affiliates as if it were service with Buyer for
purposes of satisfying any vesting requirements under any benefit plans
offered by Buyer (but not for purposes of benefit accrual or for determining
the amount of benefits payable under any benefit plan other than a vacation
plan). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment to any particular employee benefit plan, (ii) obligate
Buyer or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan or
(B) retain the employment of any particular employee (in general or at a
particular rate of compensation), or (iii) give any third party the right to
enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement. Buyer retains all rights to
amend or terminate any of its benefit programs in its sole discretion.

(c) Buyer shall be responsible for any obligations under federal, state or
local plant closing statutes, including the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988, as amended ("WARN Act"), with respect to events
occurring after the Closing Date other than any such obligations arising from
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Sellers and Morris Communications shall be responsible for and timely pay
all compensation owed to New Employees and shall be responsible for and timely
provide New Employees with all benefits owed under the Employee Benefit
Programs through the Closing Date. Sellers and Morris Communications will
retain all of the Employee Benefit Programs, including all employee benefit
plans and pension plans, and Buyer will not assume obligations under any such
programs. Sellers shall take all necessary and appropriate action to ensure
that New Employees will not continue to be  



 

58  active participants in the Employee Benefit Programs after the Closing Date.
Sellers and Morris Communications shall be fully and solely responsible for
any costs, expenses, obligations and liabilities arising out of the pension,
retirement or other benefit obligations attributable to the Employee Benefit
Programs and Sellers current or former employees related to the period on or
prior to the Closing Date.

10.6 _Further Assurances and Consents_.

(a) To the extent Buyer and GateHouse Media have proceeded with Closing
notwithstanding the failure of Sellers or Morris Communications to effect the
deliveries contemplated by Sections 8.1(b) or 8.4, from time to time after the
Closing Date, without further consideration, Sellers and Morris Communications
will, at their expense, (i) execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, such documents to Buyer and GateHouse Media as Buyer and GateHouse
Media may reasonably request in order to effectively vest in Buyer good and
valid (and, in the case of Real Property, good and marketable) title to the
Acquired Assets, and (ii) subject to Section 5.6(b), use reasonable efforts
to obtain any third-party consents to the assignment to Buyer of the Material
Contracts which require the consent of any third party by reason of the
transactions provided for in this Agreement and which were not obtained by
Sellers or Morris Communications on or before the Closing Date.

(b) From time to time after the Closing Date, Buyer will provide Sellers with
access, with reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, to the
financial records of the Publications related to the period on or prior to the
Closing Date for use by Sellers in connection with Tax and/or legal
proceedings related to the operation of the Publications on or prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer agrees to maintain all Tax records related to the
Publications for all Tax years that remain open as of the Closing Date unless
and until (i) Sellers notify Buyer in writing that any such Tax year(s) has
(have) been closed or (ii) Buyer has given Sellers prior written notice of its
intent to destroy such records and Sellers have not reasonably and promptly
requested that such records not be destroyed.

(c) If, in order to properly prepare its financial statements or documents to
be filed with any Governmental Authority, it is necessary that any party
hereto be furnished with additional information relating to the Acquired
Assets or the Publications and such  



 

59  information is in the possession of any of the other parties hereto, such
party or parties agree to use its/their best efforts to furnish such
information to the requesting party without cost or expense to the requesting
party, unless it is necessary for such party or parties to incur third party
expenses (e.g. legal or accounting fees) in connection with such request in
which case the requesting party shall reimburse the furnishing party for such
third party expenses. After the Closing Date, except to the extent otherwise
noted, each of the parties hereto, shall, to the extent reasonably requested
by any other party hereto: (i) assist in the preparation of Tax Returns
relating to the Acquired Assets and/or the Publications, (ii) cooperate in
preparing any audits by or disputes with any Governmental Authority, including
but not limited to, regarding any Tax Returns, (iii) at any time after the
execution of this Agreement, assist in the preparation of audited financial
statements to the extent they relate to, incorporate or rely upon any
information regarding the Acquired Assets and/or the Publications, including
but not limited to providing relevant work papers and any certification or
representation reasonably requested, (iv) make available information, records
and documents relating to Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets and/or the
Publications (provided that each party shall have the right to reasonably
limit contact and communications to specific individuals within their
respective companies), and (v) furnish copies of correspondence received from
any Governmental Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information
request relating to the Acquired Assets and/or the Publications.

(d) Each of Buyer and GateHouse Media, on the one hand, and Sellers and
Morris Communications on the other hand, shall use its reasonable commercial
efforts, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to use their reasonable
commercial efforts, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as practicable following the date hereof. Each of Buyer and
GateHouse Media, on the one hand, and Sellers and Morris Communications on the
other hand, shall cooperate with the other party, and use all reasonable
commercial efforts, to (a) procure all necessary and appropriate applications,
notifications, filings and certifications, and satisfy all requirements
prescribed by applicable law, rule on regulation for, and all conditions
set forth in this Agreement to, the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and (b) effect the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement at the earliest  



 

60  practicable date consistent with the terms hereof. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Buyer and GateHouse Media, on the one
hand, and Sellers and Morris Communications on the other hand, shall (i)
cooperate in good faith and take all actions necessary, appropriate or
advisable to file expeditiously and diligently with the Federal Trade
Commission and the Department of Justice the materials required pursuant to
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, (ii) use its reasonable commercial efforts to
prosecute such filings and respond to inquiries related to a favorable
conclusion, (iii) not extend any waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act or enter into any agreement not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
other party, and (iv) use its reasonable commercial efforts to avoid entry of
(or to have vacated or terminated) any decree, order or judgment that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. In addition, subject to Sections 5.7
and 10.18 and except as prohibited by applicable law, rule or regulation, each
of Buyer and GateHouse Media, on the one hand, and Sellers and Morris
Communications on the other hand, shall (x) promptly notify the other party of
any written communication to such party from any Governmental Authority
regarding antitrust matters and permit such other party to review in advance
any proposed written communication to any such Governmental Authority, and (y)
not participate in any meetings or substantive discussions with any
Governmental Authority with respect to antitrust matters without offering the
other party a meaningful opportunity to participate in such meetings or
discussions.

(e) If the parties are not able to agree upon the Transition Services
Agreements prior to the Closing, Morris Communications and Sellers shall
provide to Buyer transition services as and to the extent reasonably requested
by Buyer, at Buyers cost (which shall be equal to Sellers cost), pending
the execution of the Transition Services Agreements, if any.

10.7 _Waiver of Compliance_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation,
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be
waived only by a written instrument signed by the party granting the waiver.
Any such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with a term of
this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure to comply.

10.9 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of its terms shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not be assigned
by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties;
provided, however, that Sellers may assign its rights under this Agreement
with respect to the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the Real
Property in accordance with Section 1.7 to a qualified intermediary for
the purpose of facilitating a tax-free like-kind exchange of real estate. Any
such assignment to a qualified intermediary shall not relieve Sellers of any
obligation hereunder, and shall not require Buyer to incur any additional
expense or liabilities. Furthermore, Sellers shall reimburse GateHouse Media
and Buyer for all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in
connection therewith.



 

63 10.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without
reference to the choice of law principles thereof. This Agreement sets forth
the entire understanding of the parties, and supersedes any and all prior
agreements, arrangements and understandings, written or oral, relating to the
subject matter hereof and shall be governed and construed under the laws of
the State of New York. Any action or proceeding involving this Agreement shall
be adjudicated in a court with jurisdiction in Monroe County, New York and
the parties irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such
court.

10.11 _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Closing, except as required by
applicable law, rule or regulation, no public announcement (including an
announcement to employees), press release or other disclosure to third parties
concerning this Agreement or the transactions provided for herein shall be
made by any party without the prior written approval of the other parties,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. With respect
to any disclosures required by applicable law, rule or regulation, including
disclosure requirements under applicable securities laws and Current Reports
on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act, each party will consult with the other
party and allow the other party to review the proposed disclosure prior to
making any such disclosures.

10.12 _No Third Party Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
create any right on the part of any person or entity not a party to this
Agreement.

10.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. The parties hereto specifically waive any right
to trial by jury in any court with respect to any contractual, tortious or
statutory claim, counterclaim or crossclaim against the other arising out of
or connected in any way to this Agreement because the parties hereto, each of
whom are represented by counsel, believe that the complex commercial aspects
of their dealing with one another make a jury determination neither desirable
nor appropriate.

10.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed via e-mail or facsimile
and/or in identical counterparts and each counterpart hereof shall be deemed
to be an original instrument, but all counterparts hereof taken together
shall constitute a single document.

parties hereto given under this Agreement, or now or hereafter existing at law
or in equity or by statute, each of the parties hereto shall be entitled to
seek specific performance of the obligations to be performed by any other
party hereto, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement.

10.17 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of
any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision hereof.

10.18 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement, including the Exhibits
and the Schedules delivered pursuant hereto and the documents
delivered hereunder, embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties in respect of the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings between the parties. This Agreement may not be
amended except in a writing signed by both parties; provided, however, that
the terms of that certain Confidentiality Agreement dated July 19, 2007
between Sellers and GateHouse Media shall continue to be in force and effect
in accordance with its terms. The parties have caused this Agreement to be
signed by their respective duly authorized officers as of the date first above
written.

primary obligor, payment and performance by Sellers of their obligations

Agreement to GateHouse Media), and no consent of GateHouse Media shall be
required with respect to any amendment or waiver of this Agreement (other than

obligations under this Agreement, nor to exhaust any legal, contractual or
equitable remedies against Buyer, prior to proceeding against GateHouse Media.
