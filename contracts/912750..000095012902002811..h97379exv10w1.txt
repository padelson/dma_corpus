                              CONVERSION OF SHARES

         3.1 CONVERSION OF CAPITAL STOCK. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any capital
stock described below:



                                       2
<PAGE>

                  (a) TREASURY STOCK. All shares of common stock of Company, par
value $.01 per share (including the associated preferred stock purchase rights
set forth in the Company Rights Plan (as defined in Section 4.2)), "COMPANY
COMMON STOCK"), that are held in Company's treasury shall be canceled and
retired and no cash, capital stock or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

                  (b) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Subject to Section
3.4, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 3.1(a)) shall be converted into (i) .05703 of one share (the "EXCHANGE
RATIO") of Parent's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (including the
associated preferred stock purchase rights set forth in the Parent Rights Plan
(as defined in Section 5.2), "PARENT COMMON STOCK") or (ii) if the holder of
such share has made a Unit Election (as defined in Section 3.2(b)), (A) the
quotient of (x) the number of whole Trust Units (as defined in Section 7.13)
elected to be received by, and that are allocated to, such holder pursuant to
the procedures set forth in Section 3.2 (the "ALLOCATED TRUST UNITS" ) divided
by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by the Election Form
(as defined in Section 3.2(a)) for such holder and (B) the fraction of one share
of Parent Common Stock, if any, remaining after reducing the Exchange Ratio by
the quotient of (x) .00054 multiplied by the Allocated Trust Units for such
holder and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by the
Election Form for such holder. Such consideration, together with cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 3.4, without
interest, is referred to herein as the "COMMON STOCK MERGER CONSIDERATION." All
shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and the holder of a certificate ("COMMON STOCK CERTIFICATE") that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration to be issued or paid
in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance
with Section 3.3.

                  (c) CONVERSION OF COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK. Subject to Section
3.4, the shares of Series B 8% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, no par
value, of Company ("COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time plus all accrued and unpaid dividends shall be
converted into an aggregate of 4,700,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, with
each holder of Company Preferred Stock to receive a pro rata portion of such
shares of Parent Common Stock based on such holder's ownership of Company
Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such consideration,
together with cash in lieu of fractional shares thereof, as contemplated by
Section 3.4, without interest, is referred to herein as (the "PREFERRED STOCK
MERGER CONSIDERATION" and, together with the Common Stock Merger Consideration,
the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"). All shares of Company Preferred Stock, when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and the holder of a certificate
("PREFERRED STOCK CERTIFICATE" and, together with Common Stock Certificates,
"STOCK CERTIFICATES") that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender
of such certificate in accordance with Section 3.3.



                                       3
<PAGE>

                  (d) CONVERSION OF MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK. Each share of
common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share ("MERGER SUB COMMON
STOCK"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of the common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall from and
after the Effective Time evidence ownership of the same number of shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (e) PARENT COMMON STOCK. Each share of Parent Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be
affected by the Merger.

                  (f) DIVIDENDS/DISTRIBUTIONS. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Stock
Certificate with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration represented
thereby until the holder of record of such Stock Certificate shall surrender
such Stock Certificate in accordance with Section 3.3. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws (including escheat and abandoned property laws), following
surrender of any such Stock Certificate there shall be paid to the record holder
of the certificate or certificates representing the Merger Consideration issued
in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to Merger Consideration, and (ii) if the payment date for any dividend
or distribution payable with respect to Merger Consideration has not occurred
prior to the surrender of such Stock Certificate, at the appropriate payment
date therefor, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to the surrender of such Stock Certificate
and a payment date subsequent to the surrender of such Stock Certificate.

                  (g) FULL SATISFACTION; NO REGISTRATION AT TRANSFER. All Merger
Consideration issued upon the surrender of Stock Certificates in accordance with
the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Stock Certificates and Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock formerly represented thereby, and from and after the
Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers effected on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Stock Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article III.

         3.2 ELECTION AND ALLOCATION PROCEDURES.

                  (a) An election form (an "ELECTION FORM") and other
appropriate and customary transmittal materials, which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Common Stock
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the
Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 3.3), in such form as Parent and Company
shall mutually agree shall be mailed contemporaneously with the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (as defined in Section 4.4(b)) to shareholders of record of
the Company Common Stock as of the record date for the Company Shareholder
Meeting (as defined in Section 7.9). Company shall use all reasonable efforts to
make an Election Form available to all




                                       4
<PAGE>

Persons who become holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock between
the date of mailing described in the immediately preceding sentence and the
Election Deadline.

                  (b) An Election Form shall entitle the holder of shares of
Company Common Stock (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary
documentation and instructions) to elect to receive whole Trust Units in lieu of
all or any portion of the Parent Common Stock that such holder would otherwise
receive in the Merger (a "UNIT ELECTION"). No holder of Company Common Stock may
elect to receive more Trust Units than the product of (i) 105.611 and (ii) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder, rounded down to
the nearest whole Trust Unit. Unit Elections may be made only for whole Trust
Units. No fractional interests in Trust Units will be issued. Shareholders of
record of Company Common Stock who hold shares of Company Common Stock as
nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities may submit multiple
Election Forms provided that such representative certifies that each such
Election Form covers all the shares of Company Common Stock held by that
representative for a particular beneficial owner.

                  (c) To be effective, a properly completed Election Form must
be submitted to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m. Houston, Texas time on
the second business day prior to the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting (as
defined in Section 7.9) (or such other time and date as Parent and Company may
mutually agree) (the "ELECTION DEADLINE" ). An election shall have been properly
made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly
completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be
deemed properly completed only if accompanied by one or more Common Stock
Certificates (or customary affidavits and, if required by Parent pursuant to
Section 3.3, indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such
certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such certificates) representing all
shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly
executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form. A holder of
Company Common Stock may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change
such holder's election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to
the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised
Election Form. The obligation to deliver Common Stock Certificates may be
satisfied by delivering a guarantee of delivery of such Common Stock
Certificates, as set forth in the Election Form, from a member of any registered
national securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc., or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or
correspondent in the United States, provided such Common Stock Certificates are
in fact delivered by the time set forth in such guarantee of delivery. A holder
of Company Common Stock may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke
such holder's election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to
the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of such
shareholder's Common Stock Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such
certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All elections shall
be revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent
and Company that this Agreement has been terminated. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall determine, in
its sole and absolute discretion, whether any election, revocation or change has
been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in any Election
Form, and the decision of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall have any
obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form submitted to
the Exchange Agent.

<PAGE>

                  (d) Within ten business days after the later to occur of the
Election Deadline or the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to effect the allocation among holders of Company Common Stock of rights to
receive Trust Units as follows:

                           (i) If, in the aggregate, the holders of Company
Common Stock elect to receive no more than 42,487,395 Trust Units, then the full
number of Trust Units elected to be received by each electing shareholder shall
be allocated to such shareholder; and

                           (ii) If, in the aggregate, the holders of Company of
Common Stock elect to receive more than 42,487,395 Trust Units, then each
electing holder shall be allocated a number of whole Trust Units equal to the
sum of (A) the lesser of (1) the number of Trust Units such electing holder
elected to receive and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered
by the Election Form for such holder plus (B) the product of (1) the result of
42,875,395 less the aggregate number of Trust Units allocated to all electing
holders pursuant to clause (A) above multiplied by (2) a fraction the numerator
of which is the amount, if any, by which the number of Trust Units such electing
holder elected to receive exceeds the number of Trust Units allocated to such
holder pursuant to clause (A) above and the denominator of which is the amount
by which the aggregate number of Trust Units elected to be received by all
electing holders exceeds the aggregate number of Trust Units allocated to all
electing holders pursuant to clause (A) above, rounded down to the nearest whole
Trust Unit.

         3.3 SURRENDER AND EXCHANGE.

                  (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
authorize one or more transfer agent(s) reasonably acceptable to Company to act
as exchange agent hereunder (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") with respect to the Merger.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent
for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.3 through the Exchange
Agent, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and Trust
Units issuable pursuant to Section 3.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock and certificates representing the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 3.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Preferred Stock plus accrued and unpaid dividends with respect thereto
(such shares of Parent Common Stock and Trust Units, together with any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the
"EXCHANGE FUND"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the applicable Merger Consideration in exchange for
surrendered Stock Certificates pursuant to Section 3.1 out of the Exchange Fund.
If an allocation is necessary pursuant to Section 3.2(d)(ii), upon completion of
such allocation, the Exchange Agent shall return any excess shares of Parent
Common Stock and Trust Units to Parent. Except as contemplated by Section
3.3(e), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

                  (b) LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL. Promptly after the Effective Time,
but in any event not later than five Business Days (as defined below)
thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each shareholder of
record of Company at the Effective Time who did not submit a properly completed
and executed Election Form accompanied by an appropriately endorsed Stock
Certificate or Certificates representing all of the shares of Company Common
Stock owned by such holder (or, alternatively, by an appropriate guarantee of
delivery) a letter of



                                       6
<PAGE>

transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of
loss and title to the Stock Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the
Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and instructions for use in
effecting the exchange of such Stock Certificates for the Common Stock Merger
Consideration (with respect to the Company Common Stock) or the Preferred Stock
Merger Consideration (with respect to the Company Preferred Stock). Provision
also shall be made for holders of Company Preferred Stock to procure in person
immediately after the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions
and to deliver in person immediately after the Effective Time such letter of
transmittal and Preferred Stock Certificates representing the Company Preferred
Stock in exchange for the applicable Preferred Stock Merger Consideration. For
purposes of this Agreement, "BUSINESS DAY" means any date that is not a Saturday
or Sunday or other day on which banks are required or authorized by law to be
closed in New York, New York.

                  (c) RIGHT TO RECEIVE MERGER CONSIDERATION. After the Effective
Time, Stock Certificates shall represent the right, upon surrender thereof to
the Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed and properly completed letter
of transmittal relating thereto, to receive in exchange therefor the applicable
Merger Consideration subject to any required tax withholding, and the Stock
Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on any cash amount payable upon the surrender of any such Stock
Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Stock Certificate shall, after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration.

                  (d) TRANSFER. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person (as defined below) other than the registered holder of the Stock
Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a
condition to such payment that the Stock Certificate or Certificates so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a
Person other than the registered holder or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. For purposes of
this Agreement, "PERSON" means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability
company, a partnership, an association, a trust or any other entity or
organization, including a Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 4.4(b)).

                  (e) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any Merger Consideration in
the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Common Stock
or Company Preferred Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned
to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such holder's
Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 3.3 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent, as a general creditor thereof, to exchange such
Stock Certificates for the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.1. If outstanding Stock Certificates are not surrendered
prior to six years after the Effective Time (or, in any particular case, prior
to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of
such Stock Certificates would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental unit or agency), the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of
such Stock Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
Company, the Surviving




                                       7
<PAGE>

Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
holder of Stock Certificates for any amount paid, or Merger Consideration
delivered, to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

                  (f) LOST STOCK CERTIFICATES. If any Stock Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Stock Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock
Certificate the Merger Consideration in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

                  (g) WITHHOLDING OF TAX. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any former holder of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock such amounts as Parent (or any affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code or state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
properly withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent.

                  (h) INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. The Exchange Agent may invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund in deposit accounts (of commercial banks
having capital and surplus in excess of $100 million) or short-term money market
funds (having assets in excess of $1 billion), as directed by Parent, on a daily
basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
paid to Parent. Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent as part of the
Exchange Fund cash in an amount equal to any loss of principal resulting from
such investments promptly after the incurrence of such a loss.

         3.4 NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Stock Certificates pursuant to this Article III, and, except as
provided in this Section 3.4, no dividend or other distribution, stock split or
interest shall relate to any such fractional interest, and such fractional
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of an
interest holder of Parent. In lieu of any fractional interest, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock who would otherwise
have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock upon
surrender of Stock Certificates for exchange pursuant to Section 3.3 shall be
paid an amount in cash (without interest) as hereinafter provided. Parent shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to determine the number of whole shares and
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock allocable to each holder of record of
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock at the Effective Time, to
aggregate all such fractional shares into whole shares, to sell whole shares
obtained thereby in the open market at then prevailing prices on behalf of
holders who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional share interests
and to distribute to each such holder such holder's ratable share of the total
proceeds of such sale, after making appropriate deductions of the amount, if
any, required for federal income tax withholding purposes and after deducting
any applicable transfer taxes. All brokers' fees and commissions incurred in
connection with such sales shall be paid by Parent.



                                       8

         3.5 CLOSING. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "CLOSING") shall take place at a location in Houston, Texas
mutually acceptable to Company and Parent, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the day
(the "CLOSING DATE") on which all of the conditions set forth in Article VIII
are satisfied or waived (other than conditions that can be satisfied only by
delivery of certificates or other documents at the Closing and where such
delivery is in the control of a party hereto), or at such other date and time as
Company and Parent shall otherwise agree. At the conclusion of the Closing on
the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Articles of Merger to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

         Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

         4.1 ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION.

                  (a) Each of Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation,
limited liability company, partnership or other legal entity duly incorporated
or organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state
of incorporation or organization, and is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing in the jurisdictions set forth in Section 4.1(a) of the disclosure
schedule delivered to Parent contemporaneously with the execution hereof (the
"COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"), which includes each jurisdiction in which the
character of the properties owned by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification necessary, except in jurisdictions, if any, where the failure to
be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each of Company and its Subsidiaries has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, use or lease its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of
Company and its Subsidiaries has made available to Parent a complete and correct
copy of its articles of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational
documents), each as amended to date, and such copies as so delivered are in full
force and effect.

                  (b) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) a "COMPANY MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT" shall mean any change, effect, event, occurrence or state of
facts that is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the
condition (financial or otherwise), business, properties or results of
operations of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or that would
reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of Company to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Merger; provided that
Company Material Adverse Effect shall not include changes or effects arising out
of or resulting from (A) the economy in general or (B) the oil and gas
exploration and production industry in general (including, without limitation,

right to such assignment; (ii) is free from reasonable doubt to the end that a

Reserve Report; and (v) does not restrict the ability of Company or its

Parent, was accurate in all material respects, and Company has no knowledge of
any material errors in such information that existed at the time such

the operation of any of the foregoing; and (iv) all interests in equipment and
machinery (including wells, well equipment and machinery), oil and gas
production, gathering, transmission, treating, processing, and storage
facilities (including tanks, tank batteries, pipelines, and gathering systems),

Mid-Continent, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("MID-CONTINENT"), is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
state of incorporation, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned by
it or the nature of its business makes such qualification necessary, except in
jurisdictions, if any, where the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as defined below).
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Mid-Continent has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, use or lease its properties and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted.

                  (b) For purposes of this Agreement, a "PARENT MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT" shall mean any change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts that
is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the condition
(financial or otherwise), business, properties or results of operations of
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or that would reasonably be
expected to materially impair the ability of Parent to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or to consummate the Merger; provided that Parent Material
Adverse Effect shall not include changes or effects arising out of or resulting
from (A) the economy in general or (B) the oil and gas exploration and
production industry in general (including, without limitation, changes in
commodity prices, changes in prices for drilling goods and services and
regulatory changes).

                  (a) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of
100,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred

<PAGE>

agreements of Parent or its Subsidiaries and (v) no bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness having the right to vote (or convertible into securities

The Parent Rights Plan has not been amended, and no amendment thereof is
proposed. No Distribution Date (as defined in the Parent Rights Plan) has
occurred within the meaning of the Parent Rights Plan, and the execution and

warrants, rights to subscribe to, calls or commitments, understandings or other
agreements of any character whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of any capital stock
of Mid-Continent. All of the shares of capital stock of Mid-Continent owned by
Parent are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by Parent
free and clear of all Liens.

                                       25

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the disclosure of any such Information by Company
will not be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.1(b) if such disclosure is
made with the consent of Parent or pursuant to a subpoena or order issued by a
court of competent jurisdiction or by a judicial or administrative or
legislative body or committee or by the New York Stock Exchange; provided,
however, that upon receipt by Company of any subpoena or order covering any of

or the consummation of any transaction contemplated by, an Acquisition Proposal

<PAGE>

abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Company or its Board of Directors may:

                           (i) to the extent applicable, comply with Rules

Approval, furnish information to, and negotiate or otherwise engage in
discussions with, any Person who, other than as a result of a breach of this
Section 7.2, has indicated the willingness to make or has made an Acquisition
Proposal, provided that (A) no information may be furnished unless (1) Company
then has or obtains a confidentiality agreement from such Person with terms no
less favorable to Company than those contained in the Company Confidentiality
Agreement (prior to any modification thereof effected by Section 7.1) and that
permits Company to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and (2)
Company has provided a copy of such confidentiality agreement to Parent and (B)
that Company shall not commence negotiations or discussions with or provide
information to any such Person (1) until 48 hours after Company has advised
Parent of its intention to take any such actions and (2) unless the Board of
Directors of Company has determined in good faith by the affirmative vote of a

                  (c) Nothing in this Section 7.2 shall (i) permit Company to
terminate this Agreement or (ii) affect any other obligation of Company under

notify Parent in writing of any inquiries, proposals or offers, or any
discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued by any Person
with Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of its or its Subsidiaries'
directors, officers and employees or any of the Company Representatives relating
to, constituting or which would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal or any request by any Person for information relating to Company or any
of its Subsidiaries contemplating, relating to or which would reasonably be
expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall include the name
of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposal, inquiry,
offer or request, and Company shall as soon as practicable (and in any event

inquiry, offer or request as Parent may reasonably request. Company will keep
Parent fully informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of
the status and terms, including any material changes or adjustments made to or
proposed to be made to the terms, of any such inquiry, proposal, offer or
request. If Company is permitted to provide information to any Person pursuant
to Section 7.2(b)(ii), Company shall provide to Parent a list of, and copies of,
the information provided to such Person concurrently with delivery to such
Person and immediately provide Parent with access to all information to which

                  (f) Company shall take such action as is necessary to inform
promptly the Company Representatives of the provisions of this Section 7.2.

                  (g) For purposes of this Agreement:

                           (i) "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" means a bona fide proposal
or public announcement of an intention to do any of the following (other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger): (a) any merger,
amalgamation, arrangement, tender offer, share exchange, take-over bid,
recapitalization, consolidation or other business combination directly or
indirectly involving Company or one or more Subsidiaries of Company with
aggregate net revenues or assets of 35% or more of Company's consolidated net
revenues (based on the most recent income statement filed with the SEC) or
consolidated assets (based on fair market value), as applicable, (b) any
acquisition by any Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) of any business that constitutes 35% or more of Company's
consolidated net revenues, (based on the most recent income statement filed with
the SEC), or assets representing 35% or more of Company's assets on a
consolidated basis (based on fair market value) (or any lease, long-term supply
agreement, exchange, mortgage, pledge or other arrangement having a similar
economic effect) in each case in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions or (c) any acquisition of beneficial ownership (as defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of 35% or more of the voting capital stock of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person or "group" (as defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act).

value), or more than 50% of Company's voting capital stock, whether by way of
merger, amalgamation, arrangement, tender offer, share exchange, take-over bid,
recapitalization, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise, that in the good
faith determination by affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the
Board of Directors of Company, after taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and the Person making such
proposal, (a) is reasonably capable of being completed without undue delay and
(b) is more favorable to Company's stockholders from a financial point of view
than the Merger.

         7.3 DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.

                  (a) Parent shall, to the extent that Company would be
permitted by applicable law or its bylaws, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (each an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES") against all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and



                                       34
<PAGE>

expenses), claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the next succeeding
sentence, settlements arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time based on or arising out of the fact, in whole or in part, that
such person is or was a director or officer of such party. Parent shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld). Parent shall, to the fullest extent that
Company would be permitted under applicable law, advance expenses to the
Indemnified Parties. Parent and Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matters contemplated by this Section 7.3.

                  (b) Parent shall maintain Company's existing officers' and
directors' liability insurance policy ("D&O INSURANCE") for a period of not less
than six years after the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to
actions or omissions prior to the Effective Time; provided, that Parent may
substitute therefor policies of substantially similar coverage and amounts
containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers if
(i) the carrier of such substitute policies maintains a Best rating equal to or
greater than the Company's existing carrier and (ii) such substitution shall not
result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to
the Effective Time; provided, further, that in no event will Parent be required
to expend annually more than 200% of the last annual premium paid by Company
prior to the date hereof for such insurance (the amount of which is set forth in
Section 7.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), but in such event shall
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.

                  (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the
obligations of Parent contained in this Section 7.3 shall be binding upon the
successors and assigns of Parent. In the event Parent or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person,
then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that successors and
assigns of Parent honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this
Section 7.3.

                  (d) The obligations of Parent under this Section 7.3 shall

enforce the provisions of this Section 7.3).

         7.4 APPROPRIATE ACTIONS; CONSENTS; FILINGS.

                  (a) Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable efforts

and the Merger required under (A) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder, and any other applicable federal or state
securities laws, (B) the HSR Act and any related governmental request thereunder
and (C) any other applicable law. Company and Parent acknowledge that the
Warburg Entities and certain of their affiliates may be required to make a
filing under the HSR Act and shall provide such assistance to the Warburg
Entities and their affiliates as is reasonably required for the Warburg Entities
and their affiliates to obtain approval from the Federal Trade Commission in
connection therewith. Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in

all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and,
if requested, to accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
in connection therewith. Company and Parent shall furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to
any applicable law or the regulations of any Governmental Authority (including

the Registration Statement) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

                  (b) Parent and Company agree, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use all of their respective
reasonable efforts to obtain any government clearances required for Closing
(including through compliance with the HSR Act and any applicable foreign
government reporting requirements), to respond to any government requests for
information, and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) (each, an "ORDER") that restricts, prevents or
prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including, without limitation, by vigorously pursuing all
available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and all available
legislative action. Parent and Company also agree to take any and all of the
following actions to the extent necessary to obtain the approval of any
Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the enforcement of any applicable
laws regarding the Merger: entering into negotiations; providing information;
substantially complying with any second request for information pursuant to the
HSR Act; making proposals; and entering into and performing agreements or
submitting to judicial or administrative orders; provided, however, that in no
event shall Parent or Company take, or be required to take, any action that
would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be. The parties hereto will
consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of
one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on
behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to
the HSR Act or any other federal, state or foreign antitrust or fair trade law.

                  (c) Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other
of (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or is reasonably likely to be required as a condition
to the Merger, (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger, (iii) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or threatened in writing against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting Company, Parent or their
Subsidiaries that relate




                                       36
<PAGE>

to the consummation of the Merger; and (iv) any change that is reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect,
respectively, or is likely to delay or impede the ability of either Company or
Parent, respectively, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or to fulfill their respective obligations set forth herein.

                  (d) (i) Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third Persons, and use, and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, all reasonable efforts to obtain any
consents from third Persons (A) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to satisfy any of the conditions
set forth in Article VIII, (B) otherwise required under any contracts, licenses,
leases or other agreements in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or (C) required to prevent a Company Material
Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or after the Effective Time or a Parent
Material Adverse Effect from occurring after the Effective Time.

                           (ii) If any party shall fail to obtain any consent
from a third Person described in subsection (d)(i) above, such party shall use
all reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably requested by
the other parties, to limit the adverse effect upon Company and Parent, their
respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or that

affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other
transactions contemplated hereby without prior consultation of the other party,
except as may be required by law or by any listing agreement with a national

the aggregate provide a level of benefits for individuals who are employees of

substantially comparable to the level of benefits (other than those provided

prior to the Effective Time (provided that changes may be made to such employee
benefit plans to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law) or (ii) no
less favorable than those provided by Parent to similarly situated employees of
Parent from time to time; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement

its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time be continued for any specific period
of time after the Effective Time.

                  (b) To the extent service is relevant for purposes of

Parent or Company for the benefit of employees of Company and its Subsidiaries,
employees of Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall be
credited for service accrued as of the Effective Time with Company and its
Subsidiaries to the extent such service was credited under a similar plan,

Company's group health plan, employees of Company and its Subsidiaries shall
receive credit for the year during which participation in the substituted group
health plan begins with any deductibles and copayments already incurred during
such year under the terminated or discontinued group health plan, and Parent
shall waive any preexisting condition limitation applicable to such employees to
the extent that the employee's or dependent's condition would not have operated
as a preexisting condition under the terminated or discontinued group health

court of competent jurisdiction shall have adopted any law or amendment to any
law or issued any order, decree or ruling or taken any other action
(collectively, "GOVERNMENTAL ORDER") permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such Governmental Order shall have become
final and nonappealable, provided that the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement shall have used all reasonable efforts to remove or lift such
Governmental Order;

                  (e) by Parent or Company, if the Merger has not been
consummated on or before November 30, 2002 (the "OPTIONAL TERMINATION DATE");
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.1(e) shall not be available to any party



                                       45
<PAGE>

whose failure or whose Affiliates' failure to perform in all material respects
any covenant, obligation or agreement hereunder has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date;

                  (f) by Parent or Company, if the Company Shareholders'
Approval is not obtained at the Company Shareholder Meeting (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof);

                  (g) by Parent, if the Board of Directors of Company (i) fails
to recommend, or withdraws, modifies or changes in any manner adverse to Parent
its recommendation of, this Agreement and the Merger to the shareholders of
Company, (ii) approves or recommends any Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acquisition Proposal by Parent), (iii) has not sent to its shareholders pursuant
to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Act a statement disclosing that
the Board of Directors of Company recommends rejection of any tender or exchange
offer relating to its securities that has been commenced by a Person
unaffiliated with Parent within ten Business Days after such tender or exchange
offer is first published, sent or given or (iv) resolves to take any of the
actions specified in clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 10.1(g); or

                  (h) by Company, at any time prior to receipt of the Company
Shareholders' Approval, upon 48 hours prior written notice to Parent, if (i) a
Superior Proposal has been made and not been withdrawn, (ii) such Superior
Proposal did not result from a breach of Section 7.2, (iii) the Board of
Directors of Company has determined in good faith by the affirmative vote of a
majority of its members that, as the result of such Superior Proposal, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, such action is necessary for the
Board of Directors of Company to comply with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law and (iv) Parent does not make, within 48 hours of receipt of
Company's written notification of its intention to terminate this Agreement, a
written offer that the Board of Directors of Company determines in good faith,
is at least as favorable, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of
Company as such Superior Proposal.

         10.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. Except as provided in Section 10.3, if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void, there shall be no liability on the part of the parties hereto or
any of their respective officers or directors to any of the other parties hereto
and all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease, except that (i)
Section 7.1(b) shall survive such termination for a period of two years from the
date of such termination and (ii) Sections 7.6, 10.3 and 11.8 and, to the extent
relevant, the remaining provisions of Article XI shall survive such termination
indefinitely. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the termination of this
Agreement nor anything herein will relieve any party from liability for any
willful misrepresentation or inaccuracy in any of its representations or
warranties or any material breach or non-performance of any of its covenants or
agreements under this Agreement. If it shall be judicially determined (and such
determination shall have become final and nonappealable) that termination of
this Agreement was caused by a willful inaccuracy or breach of this Agreement,
then, in addition to any other remedies at law or equity for such inaccuracy or
breach of this Agreement, the party so found to have willfully caused such
inaccuracy or breach shall indemnify and hold harmless the other parties for
their Expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1.
