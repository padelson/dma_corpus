and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Buyer agrees to purchase
from the Seller, and the Seller agrees to sell to the Buyer, all of the
Acquired Company Shares at the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby
(the " _Closing_ "), free and clear of all Liens (other than (a) Liens on
transfer imposed under applicable securities Laws and (b) Liens created by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates), for the consideration specified in _Section
2.2_ (the " _Stock Purchase_ ").

 



 

Section 2.2 _Payment of Estimated Purchase Price_. At the Closing, the Buyer
shall pay the Estimated Purchase Price (less the face amount of the Seller
Debt Financing consummated at the Closing) in immediately available funds by
wire transfer to an account or accounts that have been designated in writing
by the Seller to the Buyer not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the

(C) the Estimated Transaction Expenses, minus (D) the Target Net Working
Capital. The amount of the Initial Adjustment Amount shall be denominated in
Dollars. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the amounts set forth in the
Pre-Closing Statement are solely for purposes of determining the Initial
Adjustment Amount and the Estimated Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2,
and the exclusive recourse of Buyer with respect to inaccuracies or disputes
with respect thereto is the resolution procedures in Section 2.4.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date or, if earlier, within
thirty (30) days of delivery by the Seller to the Buyer, pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement (to the extent required thereby), of the data
required to complete the Closing Statement, the Buyer shall deliver to the
Seller a certificate executed by an executive officer of the Buyer (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the actual amounts of (i) Net Working
Capital (the " _Post-Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) Net Indebtedness
(the " _Post-Closing Net Indebtedness_ "), (iii) Transaction Expenses (the "
_Post-Closing Transaction Expenses_ ") and (iv) the Post-Closing Adjustment
Amount, together with reasonable supporting documentation. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Post-Closing Adjustment Amount_ " means an amount (which
may be positive or negative) equal to (A) the Post-Closing Net Working
Capital, _plus_ (B) the Post-Closing Net Indebtedness, _minus_ (C) the Post-
Closing Transaction Expenses, _minus_ (D) the Target Net Working Capital. The
amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount shall be denominated in Dollars.
The Buyer agrees to prepare the Closing Statement and determine the Post-
Closing Net Working Capital in accordance with the Accounting Rules, and
determine Post-Closing Net Indebtedness and Post-Closing Transaction Expenses
in accordance with the definitions thereof (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any definitions of terms referred to therein). Such calculations are
not intended to, and shall not, permit the introduction of different
components, judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies for the purpose of
preparing the Closing Statement or determining the Post-Closing Net Working
Capital, Post-Closing Net Indebtedness and Post-Closing Transaction Expenses
other than the Accounting Rules and the applicable definitions (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any definitions of terms referred to therein) of Post-
Closing Net Working Capital, Post-Closing Net Indebtedness and Post-Closing
Transaction Expenses, as the case may be, or to take into account any events,
conditions or developments occurring after Closing with respect to any such
calculations, components, judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles,
practices, procedures, classifications or estimation

 



      
 

 



 

methodologies. Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer agrees that the
Closing Statement shall entirely disregard (i) any and all effects on the
assets or liabilities of the Acquired Companies of any financing or
refinancing arrangements entered into at any time by the Buyer or any other
transaction entered into by the Buyer in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) any of the plans, transactions,
or changes which the Buyer (or the Acquired Companies) intends to initiate or
make or causes to be initiated or made after the Closing with respect to the
Acquired Companies or their business or assets, or any facts or circumstances
that are unique or particular to the Buyer or any of its assets or
liabilities.

 



 

(b) Within thirty (30) days after the Sellers receipt of the Closing
Statement, the Seller may deliver to the Buyer a written statement either
accepting the Closing Statement or specifying any objections thereto
(including therein the Sellers calculations of any disputed items or amounts
and the Sellers grounds for such disagreement in reasonable detail) (an "
_Objections Statement_ "). If the Seller does not deliver an Objections
Statement to the Buyer within thirty (30) days after the Sellers receipt of
the Closing Statement, the Closing Statement will be final and binding upon
the Seller and the Buyer.

 



 

(c) If the Seller delivers an Objections Statement, then the Seller and the
Buyer shall, during the thirty (30) days following such delivery, negotiate in
good faith to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine, as may be required, the amount of Net Working Capital, Net
Indebtedness and/or Transaction Expenses. If the Seller and the Buyer are
unable to reach such agreement during such period, then they shall promptly
thereafter appoint Ernst and Young or, if such firm is unavailable, an
independent accountant of nationally recognized standing reasonably
satisfactory to the Seller and the Buyer (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") to
promptly review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the
purpose of calculating the actual amount of Net Working Capital, Net
Indebtedness and/or Transaction Expenses. The Accounting Firm, acting as an
expert and not as an arbitrator, shall determine in accordance with this
Agreement (including the Accounting Rules attached hereto) the actual amount
of Net Working Capital, Net Indebtedness and/or Transaction Expenses and shall
deliver to the Seller and the Buyer a written report setting forth such
calculations. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm (i) shall be
bound by the provisions of this Section 2.4 and the definitions of Net Working
Capital, Net Indebtedness and/or Transaction Expenses, (ii) shall limit its
review to the disputed items submitted to the Accounting Firm for resolution,
and shall be instructed not to otherwise investigate matters independently and
(iii) shall further limit its review solely to whether the Closing Statement
has been prepared in accordance with this Section 2.4 or contains any
mathematical or clerical error. The determination of any disputed items
cannot, however, be in excess of, or less than, the greatest or lowest value,
respectively, claimed for any such item in the Closing Statement or Objections
Statement. Such report shall be final and binding upon the Seller and the
Buyer, absent manifest error. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be allocated 50% to the Seller, on the one hand, and 50% to the
Buyer, on the other hand.

 



 

(d) During the period of time from and after the Closing Date through the
final determination of the Final Adjustment Amount in accordance with this
Section 2.4, the Buyer shall afford, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to
afford, to the Seller and the Accounting Firm, if any, and any accountants,
counsel or other Representatives retained by the Seller and/or the Accounting
Firm, if any, during reasonable business hours and upon reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

notice to the Buyer, direct access to, and, to the extent applicable, paper
and electronic copies of, the properties, books, contracts, personnel,
Representatives (including the Buyers accountants) and records of the
Acquired Companies, their respective Subsidiaries and such Representatives
(including the work papers of the Acquired Companies accountants) that are
reasonably relevant to the review of the Closing Statement and the calculation
of Net Working Capital, Net Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses in
accordance with this Section 2.4. Except to the extent disclosure is required
by applicable Law, the Seller agrees that it shall, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause any accountants, counsel or other Representatives
retained by the Seller to, hold all information acquired pursuant to this
Section 2.4(d) in confidence in accordance with Section 7.3 Following the
Closing, the Buyer shall not destroy or amend the books and records of the
Acquired Companies to the extent such actions would materially and adversely
affect the preparation of the Closing Statement or the review thereof. No
actions taken by the Buyer on its own behalf or on behalf of the Acquired
Companies or their respective Subsidiaries, on or following the Closing Date
shall be given effect for purposes of determining the Post-Closing Net Working
Capital, Post-Closing Net Indebtedness or Post-Closing Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(e) As used herein, " _Final Adjustment Amount_ " means (i) if the Seller
fails to deliver an Objections Statement in accordance with Section 2.4(b),
the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount as set forth in the Closing Statement, or
(ii) if a dispute between the Seller and the Buyer with respect to the Net
Working Capital, Net Indebtedness and/or Transaction Expenses is resolved by
resolution of the Buyer and the Seller or by submission of any remaining
disputes to the Accounting Firm, as contemplated by this Section 2.4, the
Post-Closing Adjustment Amount calculated using the Net Working Capital, Net
Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses as so resolved. The amount of the Final
Adjustment Amount shall be denominated in Dollars.

 



 

(f) If the Final Adjustment Amount is greater than the Initial Adjustment
Amount, then the Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days following the determination of the Final Adjustment Amount)
deliver to the Seller the amount of such excess by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by the Seller
in writing. If the Final Adjustment Amount is less than the Initial Adjustment
Amount, then the Seller shall promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days following the determination of the Final Adjustment Amount)
deliver to the Buyer the amount of such shortfall by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by the Buyer
in writing.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Withholding Rights_. The Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement such amounts as the Buyer or
any Acquired Company is required by U.S. federal, state or local Tax Law to
deduct and withhold, with respect to the making of such payment; provided,
that the Buyer shall notify and consult with the Seller at least ten (10)
Business Days before any such required deduction or withholding made by the
Buyer with respect to the purchase of the Acquired Company Shares from the
Seller. All such amounts shall be so withheld and paid over to or deposited
with the relevant Governmental Authority by the Buyer or the applicable
Acquired Company, and such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement, as applicable, as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

subject to the Enforceability Exceptions, a valid and binding agreement of the

and which would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Acquired
Companies, taken as a whole, (ii) Liabilities incurred by the Acquired
Companies in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii)

Section 4.13 _Benefit Plans; Employees_.

 



 

(a) Section 4.13(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter lists all material
Employee Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Employee Benefit
Plans_ " means all "employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA) and all other employee benefit, fringe benefit, profit-sharing,
compensation, termination, pension, retirement, retirement savings, equity or
equity-based compensation, stock appreciation, health, welfare, medical,
dental, disability, life insurance, stock purchase, stock option, severance,
employment, consulting, change-of-control, retention, bonus, incentive and
deferred compensation plans, programs, agreements, arrangements and policies,
whether or not subject to ERISA, whether formal or informal, oral or written,
legally binding or not, that are sponsored, maintained or contributed to by
the Seller, any Acquired Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or
with respect to which the Seller, any Acquired Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries has or could have any obligation or liability,
contingent or otherwise, in each case for the benefit of or with respect to
any Acquired Company Employee or Former Acquired Company Employee or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof. No Acquired Company currently sponsors or
maintains any Employee Benefit Plans that are subject to ERISA.

 



 

(b) All Employee Benefit Plans are in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws and
have been administered in accordance with their terms and such laws, except
where any such failure to so comply would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in liability of any Acquired
Company or any Subsidiary respectively thereof. The Seller has made available
to the Buyer copies of the Employee Benefit Plans (and, if applicable, related
trust agreements) and all amendments thereto together, if applicable, with the
most recent annual report (Form 5500), the most recent actuarial valuation
report prepared in connection with any Employee Benefit Plan, and the most
recent determination letter received from any taxation authority with respect
to any Employee Benefit Plan. Except as set forth in Section 4.13(b) of

 



      
 

 



 

the Seller Disclosure Letter, no Employee Benefit Plans are maintained outside
the jurisdiction of the United States, and each Employee Benefit Plan set
forth on such schedule (each, a " _Foreign Plan_ ") (i) is and at all times
has been administered in compliance in all material respects with applicable
law and maintained in good standing with all applicable Governmental
Authorities, (ii) if intended to qualify for special tax treatment, such
Foreign Plan meets all requirements for such treatment, (iii) if intended to
be funded and/or book reserved, such Foreign Plan is fully funded and/or book
reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions; and
(iv) no material liability exists or could reasonably be expected to be
imposed on any Acquired Company or any Subsidiary respectively thereof with
respect to any Foreign Plan.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.13(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
neither the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has, in
the six-year period preceding the date of this Agreement, sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or been required to maintain or contribute to, or
incurred or could have incurred any actual liability under, any Employee
Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or is otherwise a defined
benefit plan. No Acquired Company nor any Subsidiary thereof is obligated to
contribute to or has or had any liability with respect to any Multiemployer
Plan with respect to any Acquired Company Employee or Former Acquired Company
Employee. No Employee Benefit Plan provides health, medical or other welfare
benefits after retirement or other termination of employment (other than for
continuation coverage required under Section 4980(B)(f) of the Code), and no
circumstances exist that could result in any Acquired Company becoming
obligated to provide any such benefits.

 



 

(d) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened Legal
Actions with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, other than ordinary and
usual claims for benefits by participants and beneficiaries, that could
individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability of any Acquired Company or any Subsidiary respectively
thereof.

 



 

(e) Except as set forth in Section 4.13(e) of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
the execution and delivery by the Seller of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Seller of the Stock Purchase is not reasonably expected to
result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
compensation or benefits to any Acquired Company Employee or Former Acquired
Company Employee. No amount or other entitlement that could be received as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby (alone or in conjunction with
any other event) by any Acquired Company Employee that is a "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) with respect to any
Acquired Company will constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280(G)(b)(1) of the Code. Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A of the
Code) has at all times been in compliance in all material respects with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and no Acquired Company Employee or
Former Acquired Company Employee is entitled to receive any gross-up or
additional payment by reason of the tax required by Section 409A or 4999 of
the Code being imposed on such person.

 



 

(f) There is no unfair labor practice, charge, complaint, material grievance
or arbitration proceeding in progress or, to the Knowledge of the Seller,
threatened against any of

 



      
 

 



 

the Acquired Companies that could individually or in the aggregate reasonably
be expected to result in a material liability of any Acquired Company or any
Subsidiary respectively thereof.

 



 

(g) Except as disclosed in Section 4.13(g) of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
during the past five years (i) neither the Seller nor any Acquired Company is
or was party to any collective bargaining agreement governing the rights of
and obligations to any Acquired Company Employee, (ii) no Person or other
trade union holds or held bargaining rights with respect to any Acquired
Company Employee, (iii) no labor organization or group of Persons has made a
pending demand for recognition, and no representation proceedings or petitions
seeking a representation proceeding are presently pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Seller, are or were threatened to be brought or filed with the National
Labor Relations Board or other labor relations tribunal with respect to any
Acquired Company Employee, (iv) there is and has been no organizing activity
involving any Acquired Company pending, or to the Knowledge of the Seller,
threatened by any labor organization or group of Persons with respect to
Acquired Company Employees, (v) no individual who has performed services for
any Acquired Company or any Subsidiary thereof has been improperly excluded
from participation in any Employee Benefit Plan, (vi) except as would not be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Acquired Companies, no
Acquired Company nor any Subsidiary thereof has or had any direct or indirect
liability, whether absolute or contingent, with respect to any
misclassification of any Person as an independent contractor rather than as an
employee, as having exempt status rather than non-exempt status for purposes
of overtime, or with respect to such Persons status as an employee leased
from another employer, and (vii) no Acquired Company nor any Subsidiary
thereof has received any written claim that any Person providing services to
any Acquired Company or Subsidiary thereof has been misclassified as an
independent contractor rather than an employee or as having exempt status
rather than non-exempt status for purposes of overtime.

 



 

(h) Each of the Acquired Companies is in compliance in all material respects
with all Laws relating to the employment of labor, including all such Laws
relating to employment, equal employment opportunity, nondiscrimination,
employment and reemployment rights of members of the uniformed services,
immigration, wages, hours, benefits, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988 (" _WARN_ ") and any similar state or local "mass
layoff" or "plant closing" Law, collective bargaining, discrimination, civil
rights, safety and health, workers compensation, and the collection and
payment of withholding and/or social security taxes and any similar tax
(collectively, " _Employment Laws_ "), and no Acquired Company nor any
Subsidiary thereof is liable for the payment of material taxes, fines,
penalties or other amounts, however designated, for failure to comply at any
time with any of the foregoing Employment Laws.

 



 

Section 4.14 _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) Section 4.14 of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all Owned Intellectual Property that, as of the date of this
Agreement, is registered, issued or the subject of a pending application for
registration (the " _Registered IP_ "), identifying for each such registration
and pending application (i) its registration (as applicable) and application
numbers and the relevant jurisdiction, (ii) its owner of record and, if
different, its beneficial owner, (iii) its current status, and (iv) in the
case of Trademarks, the international class of goods or services specified in
such registration or application.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) An Acquired Company (i) owns and possesses (or will, as of the Closing,
own and possess) all right, title and interest in and to the Owned
Intellectual Property, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens) and (ii) has (or will, as of the Closing, have) a right to use the
Licensed Intellectual Property. All material Registered IP is subsisting and,
to the Knowledge of the Seller, and except as set forth on Section 4.14(b) of
the Seller Disclosure Letter, valid and enforceable. The Acquired Companies
have taken commercially reasonable actions to avoid the abandonment of, and to
prosecute through registration or issuance, all of the material Registered IP.
No representation or warranty is made that any item of Registered IP that is
the subject of a pending application will proceed to registration or issuance
in the applicable intellectual property office where such application has been
filed. Section 4.14(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth all actions
with respect to the Registered IP which are due before the date that is one
hundred fifty (150) days following the date hereof.

 



 

(c) To the Knowledge of the Seller, the operations, products and services of
the Business do not infringe, constitute an unauthorized use of,
misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property right of
any Person. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Seller,
no Person is infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating any
Owned Intellectual Property, or engaging in any activities that constitute
unfair competition with respect to the Business, (but excluding any claims or
proceedings relating to counterfeit goods that reasonably could not be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect).

 



 

(d) There is no Legal Action pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Seller,
threatened against, any Acquired Company and, since January 1, 2011, neither
the Acquired Companies nor members of the Seller Group have (i) received any
written notice, based upon, or challenging or seeking to deny or restrict, the
validity, enforceability, registration, use or ownership by such Acquired
Company of any of the Owned Intellectual Property, (ii) received any written
notice alleging that the use or exploitation of the Owned Intellectual
Property or products manufactured or sold by such Acquired Company or any
Affiliates or licensees of such Acquired Company, do or may conflict with,
misappropriate, infringe, dilute or otherwise violate any Intellectual
Property right of any Person, or (iii) received any written notice alleging
that such Acquired Company has infringed, misappropriated, diluted or
otherwise violated any Intellectual Property right of any Person, in each of
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), except as such matters have been resolved, and to
the Knowledge of the Seller no reasonable basis for any claims in each of
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) exist. Since January 1, 2011, neither the Acquired
Companies nor members of the Seller Group have entered into any settlement or
coexistence agreement with respect to any Intellectual Property. As of the
date of this Agreement, there are no opposition or cancellation proceedings
against any Acquired Company relating to any Trademark registration or pending
application for registration of a Trademark and, to the Knowledge of the
Seller, no such proceeding is threatened with respect to any of the Trademarks
contained in the Registered IP. To the Knowledge of the Seller, no Registered
IP is subject to any outstanding order, judgment, decree or stipulation by a
Governmental Authority restricting the use, licensing or other exploitation
thereof by an Acquired Company.

 



 

(e) The Acquired Companies and the Seller Group have taken adequate measures,
consistent with commercially reasonable practices in the industry, to protect
the

 



      
 

 



 

confidentiality of all trade secrets and confidential and proprietary
information related to the Business.

 



 

(f) The Acquired Companies and the Seller Group have implemented commercially
reasonable procedures to monitor for and take action to stop infringement of
the Trademarks included in the Registered IP and the sale of counterfeit
products that infringe any such Trademarks, and have taken commercially
reasonably steps to preserve and protect the material Registered IP and other
material Owned Intellectual Property.

 



 

(g) The Acquired Companies and the Seller Group maintain and enforce physical,
technical and logical security procedures with respect to access to and
maintenance of their information technology systems and any confidential
information stored thereon, which procedures (a) are at least equal to
industry standards, (b) comply with applicable Law, and (c) provide reasonably
appropriate physical, technical and organizational safeguards against
accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure,
theft or misuse. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Acquired Companies and the Seller Group take reasonable measures to secure and
defend their locations and equipment against "hackers" and others who may
seek, without authorization, to modify or access their systems or the
information found therein.

 



 

Section 4.15 _Real Property_.

 



 

(a) The Seller and its Subsidiaries do not use any real property owned by them
in the operation of the Business. The Acquired Companies do not own, and since
June 8, 1999 have not owned, any real property. The Acquired Companies do not
operate, and since June 8, 1999 have not operated, any manufacturing
operations. The Acquired Companies have a valid and enforceable right to use
and access, or a valid and enforceable leasehold (or subleasehold) interest
in, all leased (or subleased) real property (including all buildings, fixtures
and other improvements thereto) used in the Business (the " _Leased Real
Property_ "). An Acquired Company enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession
of each material Leased Real Property. The leasehold (or subleasehold)
interest of any Acquired Company in any Leased Real Property is not subject to
any Lien, except for Permitted Liens.

 



 

(b) Each of the material leases, subleases and licenses (and any guarantees
that may exist related to such leases, subleases and licenses) relating to the
Business as of the date of this Agreement (other than certain leases of off-
site storage units) is set forth in Section 4.15 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter (the " _Real Property Leases_ "). Each Real Property Lease that is
guaranteed by the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired
Companies) is identified on Section 4.15 of the Seller Disclosure Letter. The
Seller has delivered to the Buyer a true and complete copy of each Real
Property Lease. Each of the material Real Property Leases is, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions, a legal, valid and binding agreement of the
Acquired Company party thereto, and, to the Knowledge of the Seller, of the
other parties thereto. No breach or default exists on the part of such
Acquired Company or any other party thereto, under any material Real Property
Lease, except where such breach or default would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Acquired Companies or
the Business. No event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with the
delivery of notice, passage of time or both, would constitute a breach or
default by an

 



       
 

 



 

Acquired Company under any material Real Property Lease, and the applicable
Acquired Company has paid all rent due and payable under the Real Property
Leases, except where such breach or default or failure to pay rent due would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to the Acquired Companies or the Business. No Acquired Company has subleased,
assigned or otherwise granted to any Person the right to use or occupy any
property leased pursuant to a material Real Property Lease or any portion
thereof, except where such sublease, assignment or grant would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
Acquired Companies.

 



 

(c) None of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notice of (i) existing material violations of building codes and/or zoning
ordinances or other governmental or regulatory Laws affecting the Leased Real
Property, (ii) existing, pending or threatened condemnation proceedings
affecting the Leased Real Property, or (iii) existing, pending or threatened
zoning, building code or other moratorium proceedings, or similar matters
which could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the
ability to operate the Leased Real Property as currently operated. Neither the
whole nor any material portion of any material Leased Real Property has been
damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty which is not adequately insured
by the Acquired Company, which damage or destruction has not been restored or
repaired.

 



 

Section 4.16 _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) All income Tax Returns and all other material Tax Returns, in each case
required to be filed by or with respect to any Acquired Company have been
timely filed, and all such Tax Returns are true, complete and correct in all
material respects.

 



 

(b) All material amounts of Taxes payable by or on behalf of any Acquired
Company have been fully and timely paid, whether or not shown or required to
be shown on any Tax Return.

 



 

(c) There are no outstanding agreements extending or waiving the statutory
period of limitations applicable to any claim for, or the period for the
collection, assessment or reassessment of, Taxes of any Acquired Company, for
any taxable period, and no request for any such extension or waiver is
currently pending.

 



 

(d) No material Tax deficiencies or assessments asserted in writing with
respect to any Acquired Company are currently outstanding.

 



 

(e) No audit, examination or other proceeding by any Governmental Authority is
pending, in progress or threatened in writing with respect to any Taxes due
from or with respect to any Acquired Company.

 



 

(f) No Acquired Company (i) has been a member of a group filing a combined,
consolidated, unitary or similar Tax Return (other than a group the common
parent of which is the Seller), (ii) has any Liability for the Taxes of any
other Person (other than the Seller and its Subsidiaries organized in the
United States) under Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local, or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise, (iii) is or has been a party to any Tax allocation, sharing or
indemnification agreement, other than any such agreement not primarily
concerned with the sharing, allocation or indemnification of Taxes (a " _Tax
Sharing Agreement_ "), (iv) has entered into or participated in any
"reportable transaction" within the meaning of Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b), (v) has a permanent establishment (within the meaning of an
applicable Tax treaty) in any country other than the country of its
organization, or is subject to Tax in a jurisdiction outside the country of
its organization, (vi) has granted to any Person any power of attorney that is
currently in force with respect to any Tax matter, (vii) has agreed to or is
required to make any adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law by reason of a change in
accounting method, has any Knowledge that any Governmental Authority has
proposed any such adjustment, or has any application pending with any
Governmental Authority requesting permission for any such changes in
accounting methods that relate to its business or operations that will affect
a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, (viii)
has executed or entered into a closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of
the Code (or any predecessor provision thereof or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law) that is relevant to taxable periods ending after
the Closing Date, or (ix) has constituted either a "distributing corporation"
or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of
the Code) in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free
treatment under Section 355 of the Code in the two years prior to the date of
this Agreement.

 



 

(g) The Seller is not a "foreign person" within the meaning of Section 1445 of
the Code. Since January 1, 2009, no written claim has been made by any
Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where any Acquired Company does not
file Tax Returns (or have Tax Returns filed on its behalf) that it is or may
be subject to Tax by that jurisdiction or required to file Tax Returns in that
jurisdiction. The Acquired Companies have withheld and timely paid to the
appropriate taxing authority all material amounts of Taxes required to have
been withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party
and have each complied in all material respects with all Tax information
reporting provisions of all applicable Laws.

 



 

(h) No Acquired Company will be required to include any material item of
income in, or exclude any material item of deduction from, taxable income for
any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date as a
result of any of the following that occurred or existed on or prior to the
Closing Date: (i) an installment sale or open transaction, (ii) a prepaid
amount, (iii) an intercompany item under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13
or an excess loss account under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-19, or (iv)
an election pursuant to Section 108(i) or the Code.

 



 

(i) With respect to any period for which Tax Returns have not yet been filed
or for which Taxes of the Acquired Companies are not yet due or owing, the
Acquired Companies have made due and sufficient accruals in accordance with
GAAP for such Taxes in the Financial Statements. There are no Liens as a
result of any unpaid Taxes upon any of the assets of any Acquired Company
(other than Permitted Liens). The Seller has made available to the Buyer
complete copies of (i) pro forma federal, state and provincial income Tax
Returns of the Acquired Companies relating to taxable periods since 2009 and
(ii) any audit report issued within the last three years relating to Taxes due
from any Acquired Company.

 



      
 

 



 

(j) No Tax rulings, requests for rulings, private letter rulings, technical
advice memoranda or other similar agreements or rulings have been entered into
with, issued by, or filed with any Governmental Authority with respect to or

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER**

 



 

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered by the Buyer to the Seller concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement (the " _Buyer Disclosure Letter_ "), or such other
sections or subsections of the Buyer Disclosure Letter in accordance with
Section 13.11, the Buyer hereby represents and warrants to the Seller that:

 



 

Section 5.1 _Organization and Power_. The Buyer is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and
operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as now

power and authority to enter into, deliver and perform this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which the Buyer is a party and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements to which the Buyer is a party by the Buyer and the

equivalent or similar action on the part of the Buyer.

 



 

Section 5.3 _Enforceability_. This Agreement has been duly and validly

shall constitute, a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Buyer,
enforceable against the Buyer in accordance with their respective terms,
subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Governmental Authorizations_. Assuming the representations and
warranties of the Seller contained in Section 4.5 are true and correct, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Buyer and the
consummation by the Buyer of the Stock Purchase do not and will not require

(a) the filing with the SEC of any filings or reports that may be required in
connection with this Agreement and the Stock Purchase under the Exchange Act;

 



 

(b) compliance with applicable United States Competition Law;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) the post-Closing notification required to be made by the Buyer pursuant to
the Investment Canada Act; and

 



 

(d) where the failure to obtain such Governmental Authorizations would not
have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Buyer, the Ancillary Agreements to which Buyer is a
party, and the consummation by the Buyer of the Transactions does not and will
not: (a) contravene or conflict with, or result in any violation or breach or
default (with or without written notice or lapse of time or both) of, any
provision of its organizational documents; (b) contravene or conflict with,
give rise to a right of termination, modification, acceleration or
cancellation, or result in any violation, breach or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) of any Law applicable to the Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries or by which any assets of the Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries (" _Buyer Assets_ ") are bound assuming that all Governmental
Authorizations described in Section 5.4 have been obtained or made; (c) result
in any violation or breach of, give rise to a right of termination,

party or by which any Buyer Assets are bound (collectively, the " _Buyer
Contracts_ "); or (d) require any consent, approval or other authorization of,
or filing with or notification to, any Person under any Buyer Contracts, other
than in the cases of clauses (b), (c) and (d) of this Section 5.5, as would
not have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Sufficient Funds; Financing_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 10.2(g), the Buyers obligations hereunder
are not subject to any conditions regarding the Buyers or any other Persons
ability to obtain financing for the consummation of this Agreement and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Assuming the consummation of the Seller Debt Financing in accordance with
the terms set forth in the Seller Debt Financing Documents, the Buyer will
have as of the Closing sufficient cash available to pay all amounts to be paid
by the Buyer in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Buyers costs and expenses, the
Estimated Purchase Price and the Closing Transaction Expenses on the terms and
conditions contained in this Agreement, and there is not, nor will there be,
any restriction on the use of such cash or such purpose.

 



 

(c) Section 5.6(c) of the Buyer Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete copy of an executed equity commitment letter from Green Equity
Investors VI, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and Green Equity Investors
Side VI, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (collectively, the " _Sponsors_
") to provide equity financing to the Buyer to which the Seller is an express
third-party beneficiary (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ ") The Equity
Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Buyer and
the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms. The
Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect, and has not been
withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any
respect, and no such amendment or modification is contemplated. The Buyer is

 



      
 

 



 

not in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter, and no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach,
default or failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth therein. To
the Knowledge of the Buyer, there is no fact or occurrence existing on the
date hereof that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to (A) make any of the assumptions or any of the
statements set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter inaccurate, (B) result in
any of the conditions in the Equity Commitment Letter not being satisfied, (C)
cause the Equity Commitment Letter to be ineffective or (D) otherwise result
in the Equity Commitment Letter not being available on a timely basis in order
to consummate the Stock Purchase. As of the date hereof, neither Sponsor has
notified the Buyer of its intention to terminate the Equity Commitment Letter.
The net proceeds from the Equity Commitment Letter and the Seller Debt
Financing will be sufficient to consummate the Stock Purchase, including the
payment of the Estimated Purchase Price and the Closing Transaction Expenses
and any fees and expenses payable by the Buyer at the Closing and any other
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Stock
Purchase. The Buyer has paid in full any and all commitment or other fees
required by the Equity Commitment Letter that are due as of the date hereof,
and will pay, after the date hereof, all such commitments and fees as they
become due. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related
to the funding of the full amount of the Equity Commitment Letter or the
conditions precedent thereto, other than as explicitly set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter (the " _Disclosed Conditions_ "). No Person has any right to
impose, and the Sponsors and the Buyer do not have any obligation to accept,
any condition precedent to such funding other than the Disclosed Conditions
nor any reduction to the aggregate amount available under the Equity
Commitment Letter on the Closing Date (nor any term or condition which would
have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount available under the Equity
Commitment Letter on the Closing Date). The Buyer has no reason to believe
that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any conditions to the
funding of the full amount of the Equity Commitment Letter, or that the
financing provided under the Equity Commitment Letter will not be available to
the Buyer on the Closing Date. Except as set forth in Section 10.2(g), it is
not a condition to Closing under this Agreement, nor to the consummation of
the Stock Purchase, for the Buyer to obtain the financing pursuant to Equity
Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or any alternative financing.

 



 

(d) Section 5.6(d) of the Buyer Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete copy of an executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof
(the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from the financial institutions party
thereto (the " _Lenders_ ") pursuant to which the Lenders have committed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend the amount set forth
therein for, among other things, the purpose of financing the Transactions and
the payment of related fees and expenses (the " _Debt Financing_ "). The Debt
Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligations of the Buyer and,
to the knowledge of the Buyer, the other parties thereto, enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms, subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions. The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect, and has
not, as of the date of this Agreement, been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated
or otherwise amended or modified in any respect, and, without limiting any
joinder documentation relating to the appointment of additional lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar roles in respect of the
Debt Commitment Letter, no amendment or modification that would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the ability of the Buyer to
consummate the Transactions is contemplated.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.7 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
the Buyer has delivered to the Seller a guarantee of the Sponsors in favor of
the Seller dated the date hereof (as amended, modified or supplemented from
time to time in accordance with its terms, the " _Guarantee_ ") pursuant to
which Sponsors have guaranteed the payment and performance of all obligations
of the Buyer hereunder. The Guarantee is in full force and effect and
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Sponsor,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, and has not been amended, withdrawn
or rescinded in any respect. No event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of
either Sponsor under the Guarantee.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there are no Legal Actions
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Buyer, threatened, against the Buyer or
its Affiliates that would have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. There are no
Orders outstanding against the Buyer that would have a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

Section 5.9 _No Regulatory Impediment_. The Buyer is not aware of any fact
relating to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates respective businesses,
operations, financial condition or legal status, including any officers,
directors or current employees status, that might reasonably be expected to
impair the ability of the Parties to obtain, on a timely basis, any
Governmental Authorization, Permit, Order, consent, declaration or approval
of, or ability to contract with, any Governmental Authority or third party
necessary for the consummation of the Stock Purchase.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Investment Intent_. The Buyer acknowledges that the Acquired
Company Shares are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from
registration contained in the Securities Act based in part upon Purchasers
representations contained in this Agreement. The Buyer is acquiring the
Acquired Company Shares for the Buyers own account for investment only and
not with a view towards their distribution in violation of applicable Law. The
Buyer is an accredited investor within the meaning of Regulation D under the
Securities Act.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Absence of Arrangements with Management_. There are no binding
contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements or obligations between the
Buyer or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Acquired
Companies management, on the other hand, relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Seller after the
Closing.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Brokers_. The Seller will not be responsible for any brokerage,
finders or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Stock
Purchase based on arrangements made by or on behalf of the Buyer or its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Independent Investigation_. In entering into this Agreement and
each of the other documents and instruments relating to the Stock Purchase,
the Buyer has relied solely upon its own investigation and analysis, and the
Buyer acknowledges and agrees (a) that, except for the specific
representations and warranties of the Seller contained in Article IV
(including any that are subject to the Seller Disclosure Letter) and in any
Ancillary Agreement, none of the Seller, its Affiliates or any of their
respective stockholders, controlling persons or Representatives makes or has

information) provided (including in any management presentations, information
or descriptive memorandum, certain "data rooms" maintained by the Seller, its
Affiliates or any of their respective stockholders, controlling Persons or
Representatives, supplemental information or other materials or information
with respect to any of the above) or otherwise made available to the Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, stockholders or Representatives and (b) that, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the Seller, its Affiliates
or any of their respective stockholders, controlling Persons or
Representatives shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to the
Buyer, its Affiliates, stockholders or Representatives on any basis (including
in contract or tort, at law or in equity, under federal or state securities
Laws or otherwise) based upon any information provided or made available, or
statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to the Buyer, its Affiliates,
stockholders or Representatives, except as and only to the extent expressly

warranties.

 



 

Section 5.14 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except as and to the
extent expressly set forth in this Article V and any Ancillary Agreement
(including the Equity Commitment Letter and the Guarantee) or in any other

not make any representations or warranties, express or implied, with respect
to the Buyer, or its business, assets or liabilities, to the Seller or any

Any action expressly permitted under any one clause of this Section 6.1 shall

acknowledges and agrees that any action, including to the extent inconsistent
in any respect with any provision set forth in this Section 6.1, that is taken
by the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent it solely affects the
Seller Business and in no way affects in any manner the Acquired Companies or
the Business, shall not require the consent of the Buyer and shall not be
deemed to constitute a breach of this Section 6.1 by the Seller. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give the Buyer, directly or indirectly,
rights to control or direct the operations of any member of the Seller Group
or the Acquired Companies before the Closing Date. Before the Closing Date,
the Seller shall, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
exercise complete control and supervision over the operations of each member
of the Seller Group and each Acquired Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Buyer shall not have any right to control or direct the operations of any
member of the Seller Group following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to Closing, the Buyer and
its Representatives shall not have the right to conduct appraisal or
environmental and engineering inspections of the

 



      
 

 



 

real property used by the members of the Seller Group and the Acquired
Companies and none of the Buyer or its Representatives shall have the right to
take and/or analyze any samples of any environmental media (including soil,
groundwater, surface water, air or sediment) or any building material or to
perform any invasive testing procedure on any building or real property.
Without limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Seller and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries shall take the
restructuring steps set forth on _Exhibit D_ (collectively, the " _Pre-Closing
Restructuring_ ") on or prior to the Closing Date; provided, that the Seller
shall not amend, restate, supplement or otherwise modify the Pre-Closing
Restructuring without the consent of the Buyer.

 



 

If the Seller or the Acquired Companies desire to take an action which would
be prohibited pursuant to this Section 6.1 without the written consent of the
Buyer, prior to taking such action the Seller may request such written consent
by sending an e-mail to all of the individuals set forth in Section 6.1 of the
Buyer Disclosure Letter. Any of the individuals set forth in Section 6.1 of
the Buyer Disclosure Letter may grant consent on behalf of the Buyer to the
taking of any action that would otherwise be prohibited pursuant to Section
6.1 by e-mail or such other notice that complies with the provisions of
Section 13.5.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Delayed Assets._

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement relating to the Pre-Closing
Restructuring or Shared Asset Transfers, any Contracts or other assets to be
assigned, subleased or delegated to an Acquired Company pursuant to the Shared
Asset Transactions or the Pre-Closing Restructuring, the assignment, sublease,
delegation, transfer, conveyance or delivery of which to the applicable
Acquired Company in connection with the Stock Purchase without the consent,
authorization, approval or waiver of a third party (a " _Consent_ ") would
constitute a breach or other contravention of Law or the terms of such
Contract or other asset (other than the Shared Assets described in the first
sentence of Item 9 of Section 1.1(yyy) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, which
shall be governed by Item 3 of Section 7.1(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter)
(a " _Delayed Asset_ "), shall not be assigned, subleased, delegated,
transferred, conveyed or delivered as provided herein until such time as such
Consent is obtained, at which time such Delayed Asset shall be automatically
assigned, transferred, delegated, conveyed or delivered as provided herein
without further action.

 



 

(b) With respect to each Delayed Asset, until such time as the applicable
Consent is obtained, (i) each Party (and its applicable Subsidiaries) shall
use reasonable best efforts to obtain the relevant Consent, (ii) the Party
holding such Delayed Asset shall endeavor to provide, or cause its applicable
Affiliates (solely to the extent related to such Delayed Asset) to provide,
the Party who is to receive the Delayed Asset as provided herein, with the net
benefits under each Delayed Asset as if such Delayed Asset had been
transferred as provided herein (including by means of any subcontracting,
sublicensing or subleasing arrangement), if the same is permitted under the
applicable Delayed Asset, (iii) the Party holding such Delayed Asset shall,
and shall cause its applicable Affiliates (solely to the extent related to
such

 



      
 

 



 

Delayed Asset) to, promptly pay over to the Party who is to receive the
Delayed Asset as provided herein, all payments received by such first Party or
its Affiliates (solely to the extent related to such Delayed Asset) after the
Closing in respect of all Delayed Assets (net of all payments paid by such
Party or its Affiliates in respect of such Delayed Asset) and (iv) the Party
who is to receive the Delayed Asset shall assume and promptly and fully pay
when due, perform and discharge in accordance with their terms all of the
Liabilities arising out of or relating to such Delayed Asset. Notwithstanding
any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in exercising its
reasonable best efforts under this Section 6.2(b) or Section 7.1 (including
the actions set forth on Section 7.1(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter), the
members of the Seller Group and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand,
and the Buyer, the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates, on the
other hand, shall not be obligated to pay any consideration, commence or
threaten to commence any litigation, grant any accommodation or undertake any
obligations to any third party.

 



 

(c) The Buyer hereby agrees that the failure to obtain any Consent referred to
in Section 6.2(a) or the failure of any Delayed Asset to be assigned,
subleased or delegated to the applicable Acquired Company pursuant to the Pre-
Closing Restructuring or the Shared Asset Transactions, or any circumstances
resulting therefrom (including, in the case of any Contracts, the exercise by
the counterparty to such Contract of any termination rights or other remedies
thereunder) shall not constitute a breach by the Seller of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations_.
The Buyer hereby agrees that it is not authorized to and shall not (and shall
not permit any of its Representatives or Affiliates to), contact any employee,
tenant, landlord, customer, supplier, distributor or other material business
relation of any member of the Seller Group or the Acquired Companies (in each
case, in their capacity as such) prior to the Closing without the prior
consent of the Seller, so long as such consent is not unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Affiliated Transactions_. Except as otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Seller Debt Financing or as
set forth in Section 6.4 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, all Contracts,
intercompany balances, loans, receivables or other similar financial
arrangements between a member of the Seller Group or any of their Affiliates
(other than the Acquired Companies), on the one hand, and any Acquired
Company, on the other hand, shall be terminated with effect as of immediately
prior to the Closing with no further costs or Liabilities on the part of the
Seller Group and its Affiliates or Buyer or any Acquired Company (including
any amounts owing from any Acquired Company to any member of the Seller Group
or from any member of the Seller Group to any Acquired Company). No Acquired
Company shall have any liability to Seller or its Affiliates after the Closing
for any intercompany balance or similar position that is subject to the
Domestic Intercompany Position Agreement attached as Annex C to Exhibit D
hereto.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Efforts; Consents; Filings; Further Action_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
and in accordance with applicable Law, each of the Parties shall, and shall
cause its respective Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to ensure that the conditions set forth

 



      
 

 



 

in Article X are satisfied and to consummate the Stock Purchase as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement (including
Section 6.2(b)) and in accordance with applicable Law, each of the Buyer and
the Seller shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to, use
its reasonable best efforts to promptly (i) obtain any consents, approvals or
other authorizations, and make any filings and notifications, required in
connection with the Stock Purchase, (ii) make an appropriate filing of, and
not withdraw without the other Partys consent, a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act, which filing shall be made no later than five (5)
Business Days after the date hereof, (iii) make any other submissions either
required or deemed appropriate by either the Buyer or the Seller in connection
with the Stock Purchase under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any
applicable Competition Law, the DGCL, the CGCL, the Applicable Exchange rules
and regulations and any other applicable Law, and (iv) take or cause to be
taken all other actions necessary, proper or advisable consistent with this
Section 6.5 to cause the expiration of the applicable waiting periods, or
receipt of required consents, approvals or authorizations, as applicable,
under such Laws as soon as practicable. The Buyer and the Seller shall
cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of all
such filings and notifications, including by providing copies of all relevant
documents to the non-filing party and its advisors before filing. No Party
shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting
period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the Stock Purchase at
the behest of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other
Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the
Seller (or any of its Affiliates), nor the Buyer (or any of its Affiliates,
including the Acquired Companies from and after the Closing), shall be
required to agree to waive any material rights or to accept any material
limitation on its operations or to dispose of any assets in connection with
obtaining any such consent, approval or other authorization.

 



 

(c) Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall promptly inform the other Party
upon receipt of any material communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding the Stock Purchase. If the Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) or the
Seller (or any of its Affiliates) receives a request for additional
information from any Governmental Authority that is related to the Stock
Purchase, then such party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be
made, to the extent practicable and, if permitted by applicable Law, after
consultation with the other Party, an appropriate response to such request.
Neither the Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) nor the Seller (or any of its
Affiliates) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, participate in
any meeting or engage in any material substantive conversation with any
Governmental Authority without giving the other Party prior notice of the
meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority
or applicable Law, the opportunity to attend or participate. The Buyer shall
advise the Seller promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements
(oral or written) which the Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) proposes to make
or enter into with any Governmental Authority in connection with the Stock
Purchase. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and subject
to the last sentence of Section 6.5(b) the Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted with respect to the
Transactions under any antitrust, competition or trade regulatory Law as
promptly as practicable.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to
Section 6.5(e) and the last sentence of Section 6.5(b), each of Buyer and
Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents, approvals or
other authorizations necessary in connection with the Transactions or to avoid
the entry or to effect the dissolution of, or vacate or lift, any Order which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing, impairing or delaying the
Closing or any of the Transactions; _provided_ that, no member of the Seller
Group shall be obligated to bear any expense or liability or pay any cost or
grant any concession in connection with obtaining (or failing to obtain) any
consents, authorizations or approvals described above (including without
limitation any obligation or other adverse consequence resulting from
terminations or modifications of the terms of any Real Property Leases in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), which
expenses, liabilities and costs shall be borne by the Buyer or by the Acquired
Companies following the Closing, as applicable, in each case, subject (in the
case of costs and expenses of actions taken by any member of the Seller Group
which are not de minimis) to the Buyers, or, after the Closing, an Acquired
Companys, prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), it being agreed that Seller shall have no obligation under this
Section 6.5(d) to take any action if Buyer or the Acquired Company, as
applicable, does not consent to the costs and expenses thereof.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to and
after Closing, each of the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to,
and shall cause its respective Affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts
to, take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to obtain as
promptly as practicable the irrevocable and unconditional release of the
Seller Group from the guarantee, indemnity, contingent liabilities and other
obligations described in Section 6.5(e) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the "
_Seller Guarantees_ "); it being understood that in connection therewith, no
party shall be obligated to pay any consideration, commence or threaten to
commence any litigation, grant any accommodation or undertake any obligations
to any third party and, without the prior written consent of the other Party
hereto, neither Buyer nor Seller (nor their respective Affiliates) shall enter
into any agreement or take any other action that would result in any cost or
expense to be borne by the other Party pursuant to this Section 6.5(e),
including (1) any effecting or consenting to any renewals, extensions,
modifications, replacements or supplements that would extend or expand the
duration or potential magnitude of any Seller Guarantees as in effect on the
date of this Agreement (and assuming no renewals, extensions, modifications,
replacements or supplements) or (2) entering into any binding amendments,
supplements, modifications, waivers or assignments that would impose
Liabilities or obligations upon the Buyer or its Affiliates that are not
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its controlled Affiliates
to, use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the Seller to minimize the
Seller Guarantees, including, to the extent practicable, by providing or
procuring as promptly as practicable substitute instruments to replace each of
the Seller Guarantees, providing appropriate notices and information to
landlords to allow for the effectuation of any releases of Seller Guarantees
that are available under any Real Property Leases or any real property leases
entered into, renewed or modified by or on behalf of an Acquired Company after
the date of the Agreement or (in each case) any guarantees, assignments,
subleases or other instruments relating thereto, _provided_ , that, the Buyer
shall not be obligated to post letters of credit or security deposits or make
similar financial commitments or arrangements in exercising its reasonable
best efforts in furtherance of any of the foregoing in this Section 6.5(e). To
the extent any Seller

 



      
 

 



 

Guarantee continues after Closing, the Buyer shall, and shall cause each of
its Affiliates to, (i) comply with the obligations supported by such Seller
Guarantee, (ii) within five (5) Business Days of written notice of any claim
against, or requirement to provide funds in respect of, such Seller Guarantee
(a " _Seller Guarantee Claim_ "), pay to the applicable party the amount of
such Seller Guarantee Claim or to dispute such claim in writing to the
applicable party (a " _Lease Dispute Notice_ "), and otherwise indemnify and
hold harmless the applicable member(s) of the Seller Group and their
Affiliates from and against any Seller Guarantee Claim (including, if any,
other Damages incurred or suffered as a result of a Lease Dispute Notice or
any claim against such Seller Guarantee); provided that the Seller Group shall
not be entitled to reimbursement or indemnification under this Section 6.5(e)
(x) to the extent such Seller Guarantee Claim arises as the result of any
lease defaults by the applicable Acquired Company or member of the Seller
Group arising prior to the Closing (other than any such default consisting of
a failure to obtain any consents, authorizations or approvals where Seller and
the Acquired Companies have complied with their obligations under Section
6.5(d), or to deliver any documentation or information to the applicable
landlord (where the Seller has provided to such landlord and the Buyer
information necessary therefor relating to the Seller or its Affiliates which
is requested by such landlord or the Buyer and which is then in the Sellers
or any Acquired Companys possession or otherwise reasonably available to
Seller or any Acquired Company), in each case in connection with the
Transactions), (y) to the extent such Seller Guarantee Claim arises as the
result of any default by a member of the Seller Group in its capacity as the
guarantor under such Seller Guarantee (unless caused by the tenant, or arising
in connection with a default by the tenant, in each case following the Closing
or arising in connection with a failure to obtain any consents, authorizations
or approvals where Seller and the Acquired Companies have complied with their
obligations under Section 6.5(d), or to deliver any documentation or
information to the applicable landlord (where the Seller has provided to such
landlord and the Buyer information necessary therefor relating to the Seller
or its Affiliates which is requested by such landlord or the Buyer and which
is then in the Sellers or any Acquired Companys possession or otherwise
reasonably available to Seller or any Acquired Company), in each case in
connection with the Transactions) or (z) if the Buyer has timely delivered a
Lease Dispute Notice to the applicable party and is continuing to contest the
Seller Guarantee Claim in good faith, to the extent the Seller makes any
payment to the applicable party without the Buyers prior written consent, and
(iii) not modify in a manner materially adverse to the Seller, renew, or
extend the contractual terms of such Seller Guarantee or the obligations
supported thereby without securing the release of such Seller Guarantee in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller. From and after Closing,
as a condition to and prior to a Lucky Liquidity Event, the Buyer shall, or
shall cause the transferee, purchaser or other appropriate party to the
transaction effecting a Lucky Liquidity Event, to provide Seller with a bank
letter of credit in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Seller in an
amount equal to 20% of the aggregate face amount of all Seller Guarantees
(calculated as if all of such any contingent liabilities were accelerated and
became due and payable immediately prior to the Lucky Liquidity Event), which
amount shall be adjusted annually as mutually agreed by the Buyer and Seller
based on the remaining Seller Guarantees. The provisions of this Section
6.5(e) relating to provision of a letter of credit in connection with a Lucky
Liquidity Event shall survive the Closing until no Seller Guarantees remain
outstanding.

 



 

(f) On or prior to the Closing, with respect to the surety bonds, letters of
credit or other similar facilities or instruments under which such letters of
credit were issued as set forth in Section 6.5(f) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter (the " _Performance Assurance_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Instruments_ "), Buyer shall (i) provide or procure replacement or
substitute surety bonds, letters of credit or similar facilities or
instruments, (ii) pledge and deposit with or deliver to the applicable
financial institution(s) issuing such Performance Assurance Instruments, for
the benefit of such issuers, cash or deposit account balances as collateral
for the obligations of such issuers under such Performance Assurance
Instruments in the full amount of such obligations, in each case in accordance
with the ABL Credit Agreement and otherwise pursuant to documentation in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to such issuers or (iii) provide a back-
to-back letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by an institution,
reasonably acceptable to the Seller. Upon expiration of the term of any
Performance Assurance Instrument that remains outstanding after the Closing,
Seller shall not be required to renew or extend such Performance Assurance
Instrument (and may deliver notice of its election to terminate any automatic
renewals thereof).

 



 

(g) _Consent and Release of Liens_. The Seller shall, and shall cause its
controlled Affiliates to, use best efforts to obtain, as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, (i) from the applicable
lenders under the ABL Credit Agreement a consent to the Transactions and, in
connection therewith, from the agent under the ABL Credit Agreement one or
more termination and release letters, financing statements and similar
documents that (x) terminate and release the Liens under the ABL Credit
Agreement on the Acquired Company Shares and the assets of the Acquired
Companies and (y) terminate and release the obligations of the Acquired
Companies under the ABL Credit Agreement and related loan documents, in each
case, effective immediately upon (or prior to) the occurrence of the Closing,
and (ii) from the (x) indenture trustee under the Secured Notes Indenture one
or more supplemental indentures or other documents or agreements releasing the
obligations of the Acquired Companies under the Secured Notes Indenture and
related documents and (y) collateral agent under the Secured Notes Indenture
one or more termination and release letters, financing statements and similar
documents that terminate and release the Liens under the Secured Notes
Indenture on the Acquired Company Shares and the assets of the Acquired
Companies, in each case effective immediately prior to the occurrence of the
Closing (the documents and instruments described in this Section 6.5(g), the "
_Consent and Release Documentation_ ").

 



 

Section 6.6 _Equity Financing_. The Buyer shall obtain, and shall cause the
Sponsors to provide, proceeds pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter on or
prior to the Closing on the terms and subject to the conditions described in
the Equity Commitment Letter. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall (i)
comply with its obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy
on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the Buyer contained in the
Equity Commitment Letter, (iii) maintain in effect the Equity Commitment
Letter and (iv) enforce all of its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Resignation of Directors and Officers_. The Seller shall obtain
resignations of each member of the Board of Directors of each Acquired Company
and its Subsidiaries and such officers of the Acquired Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries, in each case which have been requested in writing by
the Buyer at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date. To the extent any
such resignation results in an Acquired Company Employee having "Good Reason"
to terminate employment and collect severance under any employment or similar
agreement set forth on Section 4.13(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, such
severance shall be the sole liability and responsibility of the Buyer.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.8 _Ancillary Agreements; Approved Restructuring_.

 



 

(a) The Parties shall negotiate in good faith the terms of each of the
Ancillary Agreements consistent with the term sheets attached hereto as an
Exhibit (if a term sheet is attached for the applicable Ancillary Agreement)
and on other customary terms for transactions of this type. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent an Ancillary Agreement is attached hereto as a
form agreement, such Ancillary Agreement will be executed in the form attached
hereto absent the consent of each of the Parties.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but without
modifying the terms of that certain agreement to be entered into by and
between Lucky and Lucky Brand Dungarees Stores, Inc. pursuant to the Pre-
Closing Restructuring in the form attached as Annex E to Exhibit D hereto,
prior to Closing, the Seller shall have the right (i) to, and to cause any of
its Subsidiaries (including any Acquired Company) to, form a Delaware limited
liability company that is treated as disregarded entity for tax purposes (the
" _New Subsidiary_ "), (ii) to cause one or more of the Acquired Companies to
contribute or otherwise transfer to the New Subsidiary, on or prior to the
Closing, the assets described on Section 6.8(b)(i) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, (iii) to directly or indirectly sell or, cause its Subsidiary to sell,
all of the equity interests of such New Subsidiary directly to the Buyer at
the Closing, (iv) if a Subsidiary sells the equity interests of the New
Subsidiary, to have such Subsidiary (and any other Subsidiary owner of such
Subsidiary) distribute or be deemed to have distributed for income Tax
purposes any consideration received in the sale of the equity interests of the
New Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Approved Restructuring_ ") and (v) take
such other actions as may be necessary to implement the Approved Restructuring
in accordance with its terms, in each case so long as the actions contemplated
by the foregoing clauses (i)  (v) of this Section 6.8(b) would treat New
Subsidiary as an Acquired Company and would not (A) increase the aggregate
consideration payable by the Buyer hereunder, (B) prevent, impair or delay the
consummation of the Transactions, (C) cause any consent, approval or other
authorization to be required under the terms of any Contract by which any
Acquired Company or any of its properties or assets are, or the Business is,
bound or any Permit, or (D) otherwise effect the Buyer, or following the
Closing, the Acquired Companies, in a manner adverse to the Buyer or the
Acquired Companies, in the case of clauses (B), (C) and (D), in a manner that
would not have been the case in the absence of such Approved Restructuring. At
Sellers request, the Buyer will negotiate in good faith and reasonably
cooperate with the Seller to amend the terms of the Agreement prior to the
Closing to reflect and give effect to the Approved Restructuring, including
any appropriate allocation of consideration among the Acquired Companies and
the New Subsidiary, so long as any such amendment would treat New Subsidiary
as an Acquired Company and would not (A) increase the aggregate consideration
payable by the Buyer hereunder, (B) prevent, impair or delay the consummation
of the Transactions, (C) cause any consent, approval or other authorization to
be required under the terms of any Contract by which any Acquired Company or
any of its properties or assets are, or the Business is, bound or any Permit,
or (D) otherwise effect the Buyer, or following the Closing, the Acquired
Companies, in a manner adverse to the Buyer or the Acquired Companies, in the
case of clauses (B), (C) and (D), in a manner that would not have been the
case in the absence of such Approved Restructuring. The Seller shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Acquired Companies), and their respective directors, officers, employees
and other Representatives, from and against any and all Damages incurred by
any of them in connection with the Approved

 



       
 

 



 

Restructuring in respect of the matters set forth on Section 6.8(b)(ii) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter. On the Closing Date or following the termination of
this Agreement, the Seller shall promptly, upon written request, reimburse the
Buyer or its Affiliates for any and all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
accountants fees) incurred by the Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with
its compliance with this Section 6.8(b) which cost and expense would not have
been in incurred in the absence of such Approved Restructuring.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Expenses_. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, whether or not the Stock Purchase is consummated, all expenses
(including those payable to Representatives) incurred by any Party or on its
behalf in connection with this Agreement and the Stock Purchase (" _Expenses_
") shall be paid by the Party incurring those Expenses, except that Expenses
incurred in connection with the filing fees for any filings made under
applicable Competition Law shall be shared equally between the Buyer and the
Seller.

 



 

Section 6.10 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) From the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on the
earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article XII, the Seller will not, and the Seller will cause each member of the
Seller Group and the Acquired Companies not to, and will direct their
respective officers, directors, employees and Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly:

 



 

(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or assist in the making,
submission or announcement of any proposal from a third party (other than the
Buyer and its Affiliates) to acquire, or enter into or conduct any
negotiations with any third party (other than the Buyer and its Affiliates) in
respect of, or consummate or enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding with any third party (other than the Buyer and its Affiliates)
to consummate a sale of the Business; or

 



 

(ii) knowingly disclose any non-public information relating to the business
operations or affairs of the Business to any third party (other than the Buyer
and its Affiliates) or afford any such third party access to the books,

any action (or omitting to take any action), including any of the actions set

assumes the rights and obligations of the Seller Group under this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements and expressly acknowledges and agrees that the
obligations of the Seller Group under this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements shall remain in full force and effect.

and/or any retrospective premium charges associated with the claim so

Section 7.4 _Public Announcements; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided for in this Agreement, the Buyer and the Seller shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements about this
Agreement or the Stock Purchase. Neither the Buyer nor the Seller shall (or
shall permit their respective Affiliates to) issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation and the receipt of
the prior consent of the other Party, except to the extent required by
applicable Law or the Applicable Exchange requirements, in which case that
Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other Party
before issuing or permitting any such release or making any such public
statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) without the prior consent of the
Buyer, the Seller and any of its Subsidiaries may (i) communicate with
customers, vendors, suppliers, financial analysts, investors and media
representatives in a manner consistent with its past practice and (ii)
disseminate the information included in a press release or other document
previously approved for external distribution by the Buyer and (y) without the
prior consent of the Seller, the Buyer and its Affiliates may disclose, or may
permit disclosure of, this Agreement or the Stock Purchase to their current or
future potential general or limited partners, members, stockholders or equity-
holders in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;
_provided_ , that such recipients are subject to confidentiality obligations
with respect to such information.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Buyer and the Seller
shall comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply
with, all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated March 22, 2013 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Leonard
Green and Partners, L.P. and the Seller with respect to the information
disclosed under this Section 7.4. The Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees
that it is bound by the Confidentiality Agreement in the same manner as
Leonard Green and Partners, L.P. and as though it were an original party
thereto. Effective as of the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall

liability with respect to the Confidentiality Agreement (except for Section
9.1 of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive in accordance with
its terms).

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing, except as otherwise permitted by this
Agreement or with the prior written consent of the other Party, each of the
Seller and the Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates (including, with respect to the Buyer, the Acquired Companies) to,
and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to, hold in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law or the
rules of any stock exchange on which such Persons securities are listed or
sought to be listed, all confidential documents and

 



      
 

 



 

information concerning the other Party and its Affiliates (including any
information provided to a requesting Party pursuant to this Article VII or
Article IX, except (i) to the extent that such information can be shown to
have been in the public domain through no fault of such Party or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, (ii) to the extent that such information can be
shown to have been later lawfully acquired by such Party (in the case of the
Buyer and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, from sources other than those (A)
related to their prior affiliation with the Seller or its Subsidiaries and (B)
the Stock Purchase, the transactions contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements
and the Seller Debt Financing and the due diligence investigation undertaken
in connection therewith), (iii) that such Party may disclose, or may permit
disclosure of, such information to its respective auditors, attorneys,
financial advisors, bankers and other appropriate consultants and advisors who
have a need to know such information for auditing and other non-commercial
purposes and are informed of their obligation to hold such information
confidential to the same extent as is applicable to the Parties and in respect
of whose failure to comply with such obligations, the applicable Party will be
responsible and (iv) that such Party may disclose, or may permit disclosure
of, such information as required in connection with any legal or other
proceeding by such Party against the Seller (in the case of the Buyer and the
Acquired Companies) or the Buyer and the Acquired Companies (in the case of
the Seller)). The obligation of each of the Seller, the Buyer and their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to hold any such information in
confidence shall be satisfied if they exercise the same care with respect to
such information as they would take to preserve the confidentiality of their
own similar information.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Misallocated Assets or Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) If at any time or from time to time following the Closing, any member of
the Seller Group, on the one hand, or any of the Buyer or any Acquired
Company, on the other hand (such applicable party, the " _Initiating Party_ ")
reasonably determines in good faith that (i) an Acquired Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or a member of the Seller Group, on the other
hand (such applicable party, the " _Other Party_ ") is in possession of any
asset that should or should not, as applicable, have been transferred to or
retained by the Initiating Party in connection with the Stock Purchase, the
Pre-Closing Restructuring and/or the Shared Asset Transactions or (ii) the
Initiating Party is, or is not, as applicable, subject to any Liability that
should, or should not, as applicable, have been transferred to or retained by
the Other Party in connection with the Stock Purchase, the Pre-Closing
Restructuring and/or the Shared Asset Transactions (any such asset or
Liability, a " _Misallocated Asset/Liability_ "), then the Initiating Party
may provide written notice, in reasonable detail, to the Other Party informing
the Other Party of such Misallocated Asset/Liability. Upon receipt of such
notice, the Initiating Party and the Other Party shall negotiate in good faith
to reach agreement on the allocation of the Misallocated Asset/Liability so as
to give effect to the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) If the Initiating Party and the Other Party are unable to reach such
agreement on the allocation of the Misallocated Asset/Liability, then such
parties shall within thirty (30) days of the Other Partys receipt of notice
pursuant to Section 7.5(a) (such date, the " _Dispute Resolution Date_ ")
appoint Ernst and Young (the " _Consulting Firm_ ") to determine the allocation
of all Misallocated Assets/Liabilities existing on such Dispute Resolution
Date. The Consulting Firm, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, shall
determine, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.5(b), in a
manner consistent with the allocations of similar assets or Liabilities
hereunder and based on the historical usage of such asset or Liability as
evidenced

 



      
 

 



 

by the properties, books, records and working papers, and personnel of the
members of the Seller Group, the allocation of each such Misallocated
Asset/Liability. Each of the Initiating Party and the Other Party shall
provide the Consulting Firm with reasonable access to such partys properties,
books, records and working papers and personnel for interviews, depositions,
testimonies and other relevant procedures in order to determine the historic
usage of such asset or Liability. Such decision shall be set forth in writing
and shall be final and binding upon such parties. The cost of such review and
determination by the Consulting Firm shall be borne equally by the Seller, on
the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including Lucky), on the
other hand.

 



 

(c) The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate and assist in transferring, and take all actions necessary to
transfer, or cause to be transferred, any Misallocated Asset/Liability to the
appropriate Party or its applicable Subsidiary, including by making available
to the extent necessary their respective books, records, work papers and
personnel. In case of any transfer of an asset that is a Misallocated
Asset/Liability, the Other Party shall be deemed to have held such asset in
trust for the Initiating Party or its applicable Subsidiary during the period
from the Closing to the date of such transfer.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall, and shall cause each Acquired
Company to, cause all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation now existing in favor of any present or former director or officer
of any Acquired Company or Acquired Company Employee (the " _Lucky Indemnified
Parties_ ") as provided in (i) the Acquired Company Organizational Documents,
(ii) the minutes of any meetings of the board of directors (or equivalent
governing body) of any Acquired Company or any committee thereof identified on
Section 7.6 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, or (iii) agreements existing as
of the date of this Agreement between a Lucky Indemnified Party and any
Acquired Company, to survive the Stock Purchase and to continue in full force
and effect for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date
or, if longer, for such period as is set forth in any applicable agreement
with an Lucky Indemnified Party in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall, and shall cause each Acquired
Company to, jointly and severally, indemnify all Lucky Indemnified Parties to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law with respect to all acts and
omissions arising out of or relating to their services as directors, officers
or employees of an Acquired Company, whether asserted or claimed at or after
or occurring before the Closing Date (including in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Stock
Purchase). If any Lucky Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any Legal
Action in connection with any matter subject to indemnification hereunder,
then the Buyer shall, and shall cause each Acquired Company to, jointly and
severally, advance as incurred any Damages arising out of or incurred in
connection with such Legal Action, subject to the Buyers receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Lucky Indemnified Party, if permitted by
applicable Law, to repay such Damages if it is ultimately determined under
applicable Law that such Lucky Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified. In the event of any such Legal Action, (i) the Buyer shall, and
shall cause each Acquired Company to, cooperate with the Lucky Indemnified
Party in the defense of any such Legal Action and (ii) the Buyer shall not,
and shall cause each Acquired Company not

 



      
 

 



 

to, settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Legal
Action pending or threatened in writing to which a Lucky Indemnified Party is
a party (and in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such Lucky
Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Lucky Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Legal Action.

 



 

(c) The Buyer shall, and shall cause each Acquired Company to, jointly and
severally, maintain in effect for at least six (6) years after the Closing
Date the current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance
or policies maintained by the Seller with respect to the Acquired Companies of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are no less advantageous with respect to claims arising out of or relating to
events which occurred before or at the Closing Date (including in connection
with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Stock Purchase) so long as the Buyer and the Acquired Companies are not
required to pay an annual premium in excess of 200% of the last annual premium
paid for such insurance before the date of this Agreement (such 200% amount
being the " _Maximum Premium_ "); _provided_ , that such coverage shall not
require a total limit of liability in excess of $50,000,000 or dedicated
Side-A (Non-Indemnifiable Loss only) insurance coverage. If the Buyer and the
Acquired Companies are unable to obtain the insurance described in the prior
sentence for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Premium, then the
Buyer shall, and shall cause each Acquired Company to, jointly and severally,
instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of the
arrangements contemplated by this Section 7.6(c), before or on the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall be entitled to purchase a non-rescindable "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policy covering the matters
described in this Section 7.6(c) and, if the Buyer elects to purchase such a
policy before or on the Closing Date, the Buyers obligations under this
Section 7.6(c) shall be satisfied so long as the Buyer and the Acquired
Companies cause such policy to be maintained in effect for a period of six (6)
years following the Closing Date. The Seller shall maintain in effect for at
least six (6) years after the Closing Date the directors and officers
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Seller with respect
to any insureds other than the Acquired Companies with at least the same
coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which
occurred before or at the Closing Date (including in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Stock
Purchase); _provided_ , that such coverage shall not require a total limit of
liability in excess of $50,000,000 or dedicated Side-A (Non-Indemnifiable Loss
only) insurance coverage. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 7.6(c), in no event shall the Buyer or, after the Closing, the
Acquired Companies be required to maintain directors and officers liability
insurance or policies which in the aggregate cost in excess of $500,000.

 



 

(d) The Buyer hereby acknowledges that the Lucky Indemnified Parties may have
certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance
provided by other Persons. The Buyer hereby agrees that with respect to the
indemnification obligations in this Section 7.6 (i) from and after the
Closing, to the extent relating to the Business, the Buyer and the Acquired
Companies shall be the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., their obligations to
the Lucky Indemnified Parties are primary and any obligation of such other
Persons to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same
expenses or liabilities incurred by any such

 



      
 

 



 

Lucky Indemnified Party are secondary), (ii) from and after the Closing, to
the extent relating to the Business, the Buyer and the Acquired Companies
shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by any such
Lucky Indemnified Party and shall be liable for the full indemnifiable
amounts, without regard to any rights any such Lucky Indemnified Party may
have against any such other Person and (iii) the Buyer irrevocably waives,
relinquishes and releases, and from and after the Closing, the Buyer shall
cause each Acquired Company to, waive, relinquish and release such other
Persons from any and all claims against any such other Persons for
contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof. The Buyer further agrees that no advancement or payment by any of
such other Persons on behalf of any such Lucky Indemnified Party with respect
to any claim for which such Lucky Indemnified Party has sought indemnification
from the Buyer or the Acquired Companies shall affect the foregoing and, to
the extent permitted hereunder, such other Persons shall have a right of
contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment
to all of the rights of recovery of such Indemnified Party against the Buyer
and the Acquired Companies.

 



 

(e) The covenants contained in this Section 7.6 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Lucky Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Lucky Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

 



 

(f) In the event that the Buyer and following the Closing, the Acquired
Companies, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, the Buyer shall, and shall cause each
Acquired Company to, take all necessary action so that the successors or
assigns of the Buyer and the Acquired Companies, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 7.6.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Communications; Notices_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing Date, the Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the
other hand, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to
deliver to the other Party all communications or notices received by any such
Party or its Subsidiaries from any customer or any other Person relevant to
any of the Acquired Companies (if such other Party is the Buyer) or the Seller
Group (if such other Party is the Seller) as soon as reasonably practicable
following receipt of the same.

 



 

(b) If at any time or from time to time after the Closing Date, any of the
Seller and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or any of the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies), on the other hand, receives
any cash, checks or other property, including any insurance proceeds, which
properly belongs to the other Party or its Subsidiaries (the " _Post-Closing
Collection Amounts_ "), (i) such Post-Closing Collection Amounts shall be
received by the receiving Party as agent for and on behalf of the other, and
(ii) the receiving Party shall promptly notify the other thereof and shall
promptly remit all such receipts to the other as soon as practicable, and
shall provide to the other information as to the nature, source and
classification of such payment.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.8 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing for a period of six (6) years following the
Closing Date, the Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand,
shall each afford the other and its accountants, counsel, financing sources
and other designated Representatives reasonable access upon reasonable advance
notice and duplicating rights (including the right to make and keep paper and
electronic copies) during normal business hours to all records, agreements,
documents, files, books, Contracts, instruments, computer data and other data
and information in its possession relating to the business and affairs of the
other or its Subsidiaries (including, with respect to the Buyer, the Acquired
Companies), insofar as such access is reasonably required by the other Party,
including for audit, accounting and litigation purposes. In addition, promptly
upon a request from the Seller at any time from and after the Closing (which
request shall not be made more than once during any calendar quarter), the
Buyer shall, and/or shall cause its Affiliates to, deliver a certificate
stating whether, as of the date of such certificate, any real property lease
in respect of which a Seller Guarantee remains in effect is in full force and
effect. Nothing herein shall require any Party or its respective Subsidiaries
to disclose information to the extent such disclosure (i) would result in a
waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or similar
privilege, or (ii) would violate any applicable Law or any confidentiality
obligation of such Party or its respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Any information owned by one Party or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided to a requesting Party pursuant to this Article VII or Article IX
shall be deemed to remain the property of the providing Party. Unless
specifically set forth herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
construed as granting or conferring rights of license or otherwise in any such
information.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Retention of Records_. Except as otherwise required by Law,
provided herein or agreed to in writing, from and after the Closing Date, each
of the Buyer and the Seller shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries (including, with respect to the Buyer, the Acquired Companies)
to, retain all information relating to the other Partys business in
accordance with the past practice of such Party. Except as otherwise provided
herein, either such Party and its Subsidiaries may destroy or otherwise
dispose of any such information at any time; _provided_ , that until the sixth
anniversary of the Closing Date, no such Party shall destroy or permit any of
its Subsidiaries to destroy any information that in whole or in part relates
to the other Party without first notifying the other Party of the proposed
destruction (specifying the information that is proposed to be destroyed) and
giving the other Party a reasonable opportunity to take possession of such
information prior to such destruction, at the expense of the Party taking
possession.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver_. Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP (" _Seller s Counsel_") has represented the
members of the Seller Group and the Acquired Companies in connection with the
Stock Purchase and the transactions contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements
and the Seller Debt Financing. The Parties recognize the community of interest
that exists and will continue to exist until the Closing, and the Parties
agree and acknowledge that such community of interest should continue to be
recognized after the Closing. Specifically, the Parties agree that following
the Closing the Buyer shall not, and shall cause each Acquired Company not to,
seek to have Sellers Counsel disqualified from

 



      
 

 



 

representing the Seller or its Subsidiaries in any dispute (whether in
contract or tort) that may arise between an Acquired Company formerly
represented by Sellers Counsel, on the one hand, and the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement or any of the Stock Purchase or the transactions contemplated by the
Ancillary Agreements or the Seller Debt Financing in whole or in part. The
covenants contained in this Section 7.10 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, Seller and Sellers Counsel and shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Seller or Sellers Counsel is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 7.11 _Privileged Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Parties recognize that legal and other professional services that have
been and will be provided prior to the Closing (the " _Pre-Closing Services_
") have been and will be rendered for the collective benefit of the Seller and
its Subsidiaries, and that each of the Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than
the Acquired Companies), on the one hand, and the Acquired Companies, on the
other hand, should be deemed to be the client with respect to such Pre-Closing
Services for the purposes of asserting all privileges which may be asserted
under applicable Law, except that:

 



 

(i) The Seller shall be entitled, in perpetuity, to control the assertion or
waiver of all privileges in connection with privileged information which
relates solely to the Seller Business, whether or not the privileged
information is in the possession of or under the control of the Seller or the
Buyer and the Acquired Companies.

 



 

(ii) The Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall be entitled, in perpetuity, to
control the assertion or waiver of all privileges in connection with
privileged information that either relates (i) solely to the Business or (ii)
to a Legal Action set forth on Section 4.18 of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
whether or not the privileged information is in the possession of or under the
control of the Seller or the Buyer and the Acquired Companies.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that they shall have a shared privilege, with equal
right to assert or waive, subject to the restrictions in this Section 7.11,
with respect to all privileges pertaining to Pre-Closing Services not
allocated pursuant to the terms of Section 7.11(a)(i) or (ii), including with
respect to Group Legal Actions. All privileges relating to any claims,
proceedings, litigation, disputes, or other matters which involve both the
Seller and the Buyer in respect of which the Parties retain any responsibility
or Liability under this Agreement, shall be subject to a shared privilege
among them.

 



 

(c) No Party may waive any privilege that could be asserted under any
applicable Law, and in which any other Party has a shared privilege, without
the consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed or as provided in subsections (d) or (e) below. Each
Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to preserve any privilege held by
the other Party if that privilege is a shared privilege or has been allocated
to the other Party pursuant to Section 7.11(a)(i) or (ii).

 



 

(d) In the event of any Legal Action or dispute between or among the Buyer or
any of its Subsidiaries (including after the Closing, the Acquired Companies),
on the one

 



       
 

 



 

hand, and the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, either
such Party may waive a privilege in which the other Party or its Subsidiaries
have a shared privilege, without obtaining the consent of the other Party;
provided, that such waiver of a shared privilege shall be effective only as to
the use of information with respect to the litigation or dispute between the
relevant Parties and/or their applicable Subsidiaries, and shall not operate
as a waiver of the shared privilege with respect to third parties.

 



 

(e) Upon receipt by any Party or by any Subsidiary thereof of any subpoena,
discovery, Order or other request which arguably calls for the production or
disclosure of information subject to a shared privilege or as to which the
other Party has the sole right hereunder to assert a privilege, or if any
Party obtains knowledge that any of its or any of its Subsidiaries current or
former directors, officers, agents or employees have received any subpoena,
discovery or other request which arguably calls for the production or
disclosure of such privileged information, such Party shall promptly notify
the other Party of the existence of the request and shall provide the other
Party a reasonable opportunity to review the information and to assert any
rights it or they may have under this Section 7.11 or otherwise to prevent the
production or disclosure of such privileged information.

 



 

(f) The transfer of all information pursuant to this Agreement is made in
reliance on the agreement of the Seller and the Buyer as set forth in this
Section 7.11, to maintain the confidentiality of privileged information and to
assert and maintain all applicable privileges. Nothing provided for herein or
in any Ancillary Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of any privilege that has
been or may be asserted under this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or
otherwise.

Buyer in connection with the Debt Financing; (ii) promptly furnish (when

including the pledge and perfection of liens securing and the provisions of
guarantees supporting the Debt Financing and (iv) assist with and permit any
appraisals, field examinations, collateral audits and similar examinations

Acquired Companies solely in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_
that (i) such logos are reproduced in a manner consistent with the Acquired
Companies reproduction of such logos

take any corporate and other actions, (3) have any liability under any loan
agreement or any related document or any other Contract related to the Debt

Companies) shall be required to take any action in such capacity with respect

Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies), and their respective
directors, officers, employees and other Representatives, from and against any
and all Damages incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing and the utilization of any information in connection
therewith (other than information provided in writing specifically for use by
the Seller). On the Closing Date or following the termination of this
Agreement, the Buyer shall promptly, upon written request, reimburse the
Seller or its Subsidiaries for any and all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
accountants fees) incurred by the Seller or its Subsidiaries in connection

7.12.

 



 

Section 7.13 _Seller Debt Financing_. The Parties shall, and shall cause their

its lenders (including the lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letter) to,
(i) negotiate and agree upon, prior to Closing, the definitive documentation

practicable with such information related thereto as Buyer may reasonably
request.

(a) releases, acquits and forever discharges the Buyer Released Parties from

Section 8.3 _Acknowledgments_. Each party, on behalf of itself and with
respect to Buyer, the Buyer Releasing Parties and with respect to Seller, the
Seller Group Releasing Parties (as applicable, the "Releasing Parties"), in
each case, without limiting the provisions of Section 8.1(vi) and Section
8.2(vi),

 



 

(a) acknowledges that this release shall apply to all unknown or unanticipated
results of any action of any Seller Group Released Party (in the case of the
Buyer Releasing Parties) or any Buyer Group Released Party (in the case of the
Seller Group Releasing Parties), as well as those known and anticipated;

 



 

(b) acknowledges and agrees that the Releasing Parties may hereafter discover
claims or facts in addition to or different from those that they now know or
believe to exist with respect to the subject matter of this release and which,
if known or suspected at the time of executing this release, may have
materially affected this Agreement, but nevertheless expressly accept and
assume the risk of such possible differences in fact, agree that this release
shall be and remain effective, notwithstanding any such differences and hereby
waive any rights, claims or causes of action that might arise as a result of
such different or additional claims or facts and

 



      
 

 



 

acknowledge that they understand the significance and potential consequence of
such a release of unknown claims;

 



 

(c) in furtherance thereof, and without limiting the foregoing, expressly
waives any and all rights and benefits conferred by the provisions of Section
1542 of the California Civil Code (" _Section 1542_ ") and by any similar
provision of the applicable Laws of any other jurisdiction, including
California, Delaware, New York and Virginia, and expressly consents that this
release shall be given full force and effect according to each of its express
terms, including those relating to unknown or unsuspected claims. Section 1542
provides:

 



 

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH
IF KNOWN BY HIM, MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR;

Seller Group Releasing Party, has relied, in whole or in part, on any
statements or representations made by or on behalf of any Buyer Released
Parties or Seller Group Released Parties, as applicable, in connection
herewith or otherwise. Any breach of this covenant by a Buyer Releasing Party
or Seller Group Releasing Party not to sue shall be deemed a breach of this
Agreement by Buyer (in the case of a breach of such covenant by a Buyer
Releasing Party) or Seller (in the case of a breach of such covenant by a
Seller Group Releasing Party).

 



 

Section 8.4 _Released Parties_. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Seller
Group Released Parties_ " means (A) each of the members of the Seller Group
and each of their respective Affiliates, (B) each current, former and future

representative, affiliate, heir, assignee or successor of any of the foregoing
Persons in clause (ii)(A) or (ii)(B).

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 **EMPLOYEE MATTERS**

 



 

Section 9.1 _Employment Continuation_.

 



 

(a) With respect to each Acquired Company Employee, on and after the Closing,
the Buyer shall continue the employment of each such Acquired Company Employee
in accordance with the terms and conditions of employment applicable to such
Acquired Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing or, if such
Acquired Company Employee is not employed by an Acquired Company immediately
prior to the Closing, shall offer employment to such Acquired Company Employee
in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Article IX.

 



 

(b) Section 9.1(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter identifies all individuals
who are Acquired Company Employees as of the date hereof, and with respect to
each individual listed, indicates (i) whether such individual is absent from
work on such date due to illness, injury, military service or mobilization or
other authorized absence, including due to disability, pregnancy, parental
leave, or personal leave of absence and (ii) an estimate of the amount of such
individuals paid time off that has been earned or accrued but unused as of
the date of this Agreement. Section 9.1(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter
shall be updated as necessary from time to time prior to the Closing to
reflect (i) any change in the employment of an Acquired Company Employee (in
accordance with Section 6.1(d)(iii)), (ii) if any Acquired Company Employee
becomes absent from work due to illness, injury, military service or
mobilization or other authorized absence, including due to disability,
pregnancy, parental leave, or personal leave of absence and (iii) any updates
to the estimates of each Acquired Company Employees earned or accrued but
unused paid time off.

 



 

(c) Except as expressly provided in this Article IX, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be construed to limit any rights the Buyer or its Subsidiaries
may have to terminate the employment of any Acquired Company Employee
following the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Compensation and Benefits Continuation_. Except as otherwise
agreed between the Buyer and any Acquired Company Employee, the Buyer shall
provide, or cause one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to provide, during the
period beginning on the Closing and ending on December 31, 2014 (the "
_Continuation Period_ ") (a) to each Acquired Company Employee, salary, wage
rate, annual cash commission opportunity and/or annual cash incentive
opportunity that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the salary,
wage rate, annual cash commission opportunity and/or annual cash incentive
opportunity such Acquired Company Employee was eligible to receive immediately
prior to the Closing or, in the case of any annual cash incentive opportunity,
was eligible to receive in respect of 2013 and (b) to Acquired Company
Employees, employee benefits substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to such Acquired Company Employees immediately prior to the
Closing pursuant to an Employee Benefit Plan listed on Section 4.13(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter; provided that

 



      
 

 



 

equity, equity-based compensation, retention or change-in-control
arrangements, any SERP arrangements and long-term incentive arrangements
(including any LTIP awards) available to Acquired Company Employees prior to
the Closing shall not be taken into account in determining whether benefits
are substantially comparable.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Severance_. Without limiting in any way the other terms of this
Article IX, including Section 9.2, effective upon and after the Closing, each
Acquired Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate in all
plans, policies, programs and arrangements sponsored by the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries that provide for severance payments and benefits or pay in lieu
of notice of termination, as determined by the Buyer in its sole discretion
and as in effect from time to time (" _Buyer Severance Plans_ "), and, to the
extent that any corresponding Seller Severance Plan (as defined below)
provided such service credit, each Acquired Company Employees service with
the Seller and its Subsidiaries or predecessors prior to the Closing, and
service with the Buyer and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates on and following
the Closing, shall be credited for purposes of determining the amount of
severance payments and benefits and pay in lieu of notice which such Acquired
Company Employee is eligible to receive under the Buyer Severance Plans in the
event of any termination of employment by the Buyer or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates without Cause that occurs after the Closing, including for purposes
of calculating any severance payments and benefits due as a result of the
application of this Section 9.3. Without limiting in any way the other terms
of this Article IX, including Section 9.2, with respect to each Acquired
Company Employee whose employment with the Buyer or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates is terminated by the Buyer or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
without Cause during the " _Severance Continuation Period_ " (defined below)
under circumstances that would, under any Employee Benefit Plan in which such
Acquired Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing (each
a " _Seller Severance Plan_ ") cause such Lucky Acquired Company Employee to
be eligible for severance payments and benefits or pay in lieu of notice, the
Buyer shall provide, or cause one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to
provide, severance payments and benefits or pay in lieu of notice equal to the
amounts such Acquired Company Employee would have been entitled to receive
under the applicable Seller Severance Plan if it applied to the Acquired
Company Employee on the date of termination (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
such payment and benefits shall be in lieu of any payments and benefits such
Acquired Company Employee would otherwise be eligible to receive under the
Buyer Severance Plans). In addition, and notwithstanding any provision of any
Seller Severance Plan or any Buyer Severance Plan to the contrary, if at any
time during the Severance Continuation Period, any Acquired Company Employee
is asked by the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to relocate
such Acquired Company Employees principal place of employment to a location
that would increase the Acquired Company Employees one-way commute by more
than 50 miles, and the Acquired Company Employee does not agree to relocate,
then the Buyer shall be required to provide or shall cause its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to provide the Acquired Company Employee with the same severance
payments and benefits or pay in lieu of notice required under the immediately
preceding sentence. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Severance Continuation
Period_ " shall mean the period from the Closing through the nine-month
anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Welfare Benefit Plans_. The Buyer agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to effective as of the Closing, establish employee welfare
benefit plans to provide welfare

 



      
 

 



 

benefits to the Acquired Company Employees employed in the United States (the
" _U.S. Acquired Company Employees_ ") that, in each case, is substantially
similar to the Employee Benefit Plan identified on Section 9.4(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _Buyer U.S. Benefit Plans_ "), subject to the
terms and conditions of this Section 9.4. In the case of each of the Employee
Benefit Plans identified on Section 9.4(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
the corresponding Buyer Benefit Plan shall generally be a "clone" of such
Employee Benefit Plan and shall (i) be structured to operate in conjunction
with the payroll portal of Seller (which will be available after Closing by
Seller pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement) and (ii) be identical to
the Employee Benefit Plan in such respects as are necessary in order for such
payroll portal to be utilized; provided that, if under applicable Law or due
to restrictions imposed by insurance carriers such U.S. Buyer Benefit Plan may
not be a "clone", the Buyer shall use its commercially reasonably efforts to
provide that such U.S. Buyer Benefit Plan shall include provisions that are as
similar as reasonably possible to the corresponding Employee Benefit Plan from
Section 9.4(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, as permitted under such Law or
restrictions and the Parties shall cooperate and take commercially reasonable
efforts to provide that the payroll portal of Seller may be utilized with
respect to any such U.S. Buyer Benefit Plan. Immediately upon the Closing, to
the extent permitted by law and the terms of the applicable Buyer U.S. Benefit
Plans, the U.S. Acquired Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in
such Buyer U.S. Benefit Plans to the same extent they were eligible to
participate in the corresponding Employee Benefit Plan on Section 9.4 of the
Seller Disclosure Letter immediately prior to the Closing. The Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer U.S. Benefit Plans, the
Acquired Companies or applicable insurance carriers to waive all limitations
as to pre-existing conditions, if any, with respect to participation and
coverage requirements (and any eligibility waiting periods, active employment
requirements or requirements to show evidence of good health) applicable to
the U.S. Acquired Company Employees or their covered dependents under any
Buyer U.S. Benefit Plan, to the extent any such U.S. Acquired Company Employee
was not subject to any such limitations under the corresponding Employee
Benefit Plan, in each case, to the extent permitted by law and the terms of
the applicable Buyer U.S. Benefit Plan. On and after the Closing, the Buyer
U.S. Benefit Plans shall have all liabilities in respect of claims first
incurred by the U.S. Acquired Company Employees after the Closing under such
Buyer U.S. Benefit Plans. In this connection, effective as of the Closing or,
if later, the applicable Buyer U.S. Benefit Plan Start Date (as defined
below), the Seller will cause all of the U.S. Acquired Company Employees to
cease participating as active employees in the Employee Benefit Plans set
forth on Section 9.4 of the Seller Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Section 9.4, if the Buyer is not able to establish the
Buyer U.S. Benefit Plans by Closing, the Seller intends to use its best
efforts to permit Acquired Company Employees to remain as active participants
in the applicable Employee Benefit Plan set forth on Section 9.4 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending
on the date of establishment of the applicable Buyer U.S. Benefit Plan, which
date shall be no more than 60 days following the Closing Date (the " _Buyer
U.S. Benefit Plan Start Date_ ") on the terms set forth in the Transition
Services Agreement, and Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
to, to the extent applicable, make arrangements such that claims brought by
any US. Acquired Company Employees during such period shall be covered by the
stop-loss policies maintained by the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to the applicable Employee Benefit Plan. The Seller and the Buyer, or
their respective Subsidiaries, successors and assigns, will from time to time
execute and deliver

 



      
 

 



 

all such further documents and instruments and do all acts and things as the
other party may, after the Closing, reasonably require to effectively carry
out or better evidence or perfect the full intent and meaning of this Section
9.4. For purposes of this Section 9.4, a claim shall be deemed to be incurred
as follows: (i) life, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel
accident insurance benefits, upon the death, accident or illness giving rise
to such benefits and (ii) health, dental and prescription drug benefits
(including in respect of any hospital confinement), upon provision of the
related services, materials or supplies. In the case of claims for short-term
disability benefits, Buyer and the U.S. Buyer Benefit Plans shall be
responsible for providing and paying for such benefits for any portion of the
disability period that occurs after the Closing, even if the disability period
commenced prior to the Closing. In the case of claims for long-term
disability, (i) the applicable Employee Benefit Plan shall be responsible for
providing such benefits to any U.S. Acquired Company Employee who transitions
from receiving benefits under the applicable Employee Benefit Plan providing
short-term disability benefits to receiving benefits under the applicable
Employee Benefit Plan providing long-term disability benefits prior to the
Closing, and (ii) an applicable Buyer U.S. Benefit Plan, if any, shall be
responsible for providing such benefits to any U.S. Acquired Company Employee
who is receiving short-term disability benefits on the Closing or who becomes
eligible to receive short-term disability benefits after the Closing. In the
case of all other welfare benefit plan claims, the Seller and the Employee
Benefit Plans shall be liable for all claims incurred prior to the Closing,
and the Buyer or the applicable Buyer U.S. Benefit Plan shall be liable for
all claims incurred after the Closing, including for any period after the
Closing and before the Buyer U.S. Benefit Plan Start Date. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the Seller shall be solely responsible for
compliance with the requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and part 6 of
subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and the regulations promulgated thereunder ("
_COBRA_ ") with respect to all current and former employees of the Acquired
Companies (and their spouses and qualified dependents) for whom a "qualifying
event" (within the meaning of COBRA) occurs before the Closing. With respect
to any Buyer U.S. Benefit Plan that provides for flexible spending
reimbursement accounts under a cafeteria plan qualifying under Section 125 of
the Code (the " _Buyer s Cafeteria Plan_"), (i) the Buyer agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Buyers Cafeteria Plan to accept
a spin-off of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts from the
corresponding Employee Benefit Plan and to honor and continue through the end
of the calendar year in which the Closing Date, or, if later, the applicable
Buyer U.S. Benefit Plan Start Date, occurs the elections made by each U.S.
Acquired Company Employee under the corresponding Employee Benefit Plan for
such calendar year in respect of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts
that are in effect immediately prior to such date, (ii) the Seller agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be transferred to the Buyer
the excess of the aggregate accumulated contributions to the flexible spending
reimbursement accounts made by U.S. Acquired Company Employees to the
corresponding Employee Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date or, if later,
the Buyer U.S. Benefit Plan Start Date for the Buyers Cafeteria Plan during
the year in which such date occurs over the aggregate reimbursement payouts
made for such year from such accounts to such U.S. Acquired Company Employees,
and (iii) if the aggregate reimbursement payouts from the flexible spending
reimbursement accounts made during such year under the corresponding Employee
Benefit Plan to U.S. Acquired Company Employees exceed the aggregate
accumulated contributions to such accounts for such year by such U.S. Acquired
Company Employees, the Buyer shall cause such excess to be transferred to the
Seller or its designee as soon as practicable following such date. For the
avoidance of doubt,

 



      
 

 



 

the parties acknowledge and agree that the Employee Benefit Plans that provide
welfare benefits to Acquired Company Employees employed in Canada (" _Canada
Acquired Company Employees_ ") are sponsored by the Acquired Companies and,
accordingly, the Canada Acquired Company Employees shall automatically
continue to participate in such Employee Benefit Plans from and after the
Closing on the same terms and conditions that applied immediately prior to the
Closing. The parties hereto understand and agree that they do not intend
hereby that the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or employees be performing
any functions as an ERISA fiduciary in fulfilling its commitments under this
Section 9.4 to cooperate in the establishment and cloning of the Buyer U.S.
Benefit Plans.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Assigned Benefit Plans_. With respect to each of the Assigned

Company Employee with the Seller and its Subsidiaries or predecessors prior to

applicable payment date, in accordance with the provisions of the applicable
policy, plan, arrangement, program, practice or agreement under which any such

cause one of its Subsidiaries to establish, a tax-qualified defined
contribution savings plan (the " _Buyer s Savings Plan_"), in which, on such
date, U.S. Acquired Company Employees shall immediately be eligible to
participate and commence accruing benefits to the extent such U.S. Acquired
Company Employees were eligible to participate and accrue benefits in Sellers
Savings Plan (as defined below) as of such date. The Buyers Savings Plan

Employees enrolled in the Sellers Savings Plan as of Closing, subject to each
such U.S. Acquired Company Employees ability to opt out of such enrollment,

Company Employees election, effect a direct rollover of all or any portion of
such U.S. Acquired Company Employees balance under the Fifth and Pacific 401(k)

payroll services provided under the Transition Services Agreement are provided
by Seller pursuant thereto, (x) be administered by Fidelity, (y) be structured

as are necessary in order for such payroll portal to be utilized. In
furtherance of the foregoing, prior to the Closing, the Seller shall cooperate
with and provide reasonable assistance to the Buyer regarding the
establishment of the Buyers Savings Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
Buyer is not able to establish the Buyers Savings Plan as of the Closing
Date, (i) Buyer shall establish such plan as promptly as practicable following
the Closing Date (any such date of establishment, the " _Buyer s Savings Plan
Start Date_"), (ii) the Seller shall cooperate with, and provide reasonable
assistance to, the Buyer regarding the establishment of the Buyers Savings
Plan on the Buyers Savings Plan Start Date, which cooperation and assistance
shall be compensated for in accordance with the terms of the Transition
Services Agreement, and (iii) promptly following the Buyers Savings Plan
Start Date, Buyer shall make a contribution to the account of each U.S.
Acquired Company Employee

 



      
 

 



 

who is participating in such Buyers Savings Plan on the Buyers Savings Plan
Start Date and who also was participating in Sellers Savings Plan on the
Closing Date in an amount equal to the amount of the employer match that would
have been made to such account in respect of the employees deferrals between
the Closing Date and the Buyers Savings Plan Start Date, assuming the rate of
employer match during such period were the same in respect of each U.S.
Acquired Company Employee as the rate in effect under the Sellers Savings
Plan on the date of this Agreement. Effective as of the Closing, the Seller
shall cause (i) all of the U.S. Acquired Company Employees to cease
participating as active employees in the Sellers Savings Plan, and (ii) the
account balances of the U.S. Acquired Company Employees under the Sellers
Savings Plan to be fully vested. The parties hereto understand and agree that

commitments under this Section 9.9 to cooperate in the establishment and
cloning of the Buyer Savings Plan.

constitute an amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit
or compensation plans or arrangements of the Seller, the Buyer or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Nothing in this Article IX or elsewhere

the Insurance Proceeds or Third-Party Proceeds had been received, realized or
recovered before the Indemnity Payment was made.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except to the extent such
Damages are paid to a third party as part of a Third Party Claim in accordance
herewith, (i) no party shall be liable to any Indemnified Party for treble,
punitive or exemplary Damages and (ii) an indemnified party shall only be
entitled to indirect, special or consequential damages (including lost
revenues or profits, diminution of value or any damages based on any type of
multiple) to the extent such Damages were reasonably foreseeable by the
parties hereto as of the date hereof.

 



 

(c) No Party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person under
this Article XI with respect to (i) any Damages with respect to any matter to
the extent reflected and included in the Final Closing Statement, or (ii) any
Damages for which notice of a Third Party Claim was not duly delivered prior
to the applicable survival date pursuant to Section 11.5.

 



 

(d) Each of the Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Damages that are indemnifiable hereunder (other than pursuant to
Section 11.8) upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition that
would reasonably be expected to give rise to such Damages; provided that such
mitigation obligation shall not require such Party to (i) initiate a Legal
Action, (ii) take any action that would reasonably be expected to have a
materially adverse effect on the operation of its business, including
divesting or selling any properties or assets, or disclosing any confidential
and competitively sensitive information to any third party without customary
and reasonable confidentiality protections or (iii) take any other action that
would lead such Party to incur any material costs in order to mitigate
Damages.

 



 

Section 11.4 _Third-Party Claims_. Promptly after the receipt by the
Indemnified Party of notice of the commencement of any Legal Action (other
than a Contest or Specified Tax Matter) involving a third party (such Legal
Action, a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim
with respect thereto is to be made against any Indemnifying Party pursuant to
Section 11.1, give such Indemnifying Party written notice of such Third-Party
Claim in reasonable detail in light of the circumstances then known to such
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that the failure of the Indemnified Party to
provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure to give notice
shall materially prejudice any defense or claim available to the Indemnifying
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of any
Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party, at the Indemnifying Partys sole expense, if the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnifying Party gives notice to the Indemnified Party that it will
indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any Damages arising therefrom
(subject to the limitations herein) without any reservation of right. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim: (i) it shall
within thirty (30) days (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so
requires) of receipt of the foregoing notice (the " _Dispute Period_ ") notify
the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so, (ii) it shall not settle or
compromise such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party unless (A) the settlement or compromise does not entail any
admission of liability on the part of any Indemnified Party, (B) the
settlement or compromise includes an unconditional release of each Buyer
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as applicable, reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, from all Damages with respect to such Third-Party Claim,
and (C) the settlement or compromise is solely for monetary damages that will
be promptly paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and (iii) the Indemnified
Party shall have the right (but not the obligation) to participate in the
defense of such Third-Party Claim and to employ, at its own expense, counsel
separate from counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that
the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party if both are named parties to the proceedings
and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that representation
of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between them. If the Indemnifying Party does not
undertake within the Dispute Period to defend against any Third-Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Party will be entitled to assume such defense, at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (which cost is a Damage
subject to the limitations in this Article XI). The Indemnified Party shall
not settle any Third-Party Claim, unless such settlement is consented to in
writing by the Indemnifying Party (which such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and if any such Third Party
Claim is settled without the consent of the Indemnifying Party (where such
consent has not been unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnity
therefor hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party subsequently consents in
writing. Each Party shall reasonably cooperate, and cause their respective
Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any
Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any
Third-Party Claim (and the Indemnified Party shall control such defense) if
and to the extent (i) the claim is by a Person that has a material business
relationship with the Acquired Companies (but not with the Seller), (ii) the
claim seeks injunctive relief against the Indemnified Party, (iii) the claim
is criminal in nature, (iv) if the Indemnified Party has been advised by
counsel that (A) there are one or more legal or equitable defenses available
to it with a reasonable prospect of success which are not available to the
Indemnifying Party or (B) there exists a reasonable likelihood of a conflict
of interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party; (v) the
Indemnifying Party elected to conduct such Third-Party Claim and then failed
to conduct or withdrew from the Third-Party Claim or (vi) if the Damages with
respect to such claim would be subject to the Cap, the claim has a reasonable
likelihood of resulting in Damages that would exceed the balance remaining
under the Cap. Any consent to be given by a Buyer Indemnitee under this
Section 11.4 shall be given by the Buyer acting on behalf of such Buyer
Indemnitee and any consent to be given by a Seller Indemnitee under this
Section 11.4 shall be given by the Seller acting on behalf of such Seller
Indemnitee.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 11.5 _Survival_. The representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, and any agreement, certificate or other
instrument delivered pursuant hereto or thereto shall survive until the date
that is 18 months after the Closing Date, except for the Fundamental
Representations and the representations and warranties set forth in Section
4.13 (Benefit Plans; Employees) and Section 4.16 (Taxes), which shall in each
case survive until the date that is sixty (60) days following the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations, as the same may be waived or
extended. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement for any failure to
perform in breach of any covenant in this Agreement that by its terms requires
performance prior to Closing (other than the covenants in Article IX, Section
6.1(i) or Section 11.8, which shall survive until the date that is sixty (60)
days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, as the
same may be waived or extended) shall survive the Closing for a period of
eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date and shall expire immediately
thereafter. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement for any failure to
perform in breach of any covenant in this Agreement that by its terms requires
performance following the Closing shall survive the Closing in accordance with
its terms and if no such term is specified, indefinitely. Claims for
indemnification under this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(iii), Section
11.1(b)(iii) and Section 11.1(b)(iv) shall survive indefinitely.

 



 

Section 11.6 _Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity payments under Section 11.1
or Section 11.8 shall be treated by the Parties for federal, provincial, state
and local income tax purposes (whether foreign or domestic) as purchase price
adjustment, except to the extent that a contrary treatment is required by
applicable Law or pursuant to the good faith resolution of a Contest or
Specified Tax Matter.

 



 

Section 11.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, from and after the Closing, indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of this Article XI shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of any
Party and each of its respective Affiliates (including, in the case of the
Buyer after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) for any misrepresentation or
the failure of any representation and warranty to not be true and correct, or
any breach of any covenant or other provision or agreement contained in this
Agreement or any agreements entered into to effectuate the Pre-Closing
Restructuring and for any and all other claims arising under, out of or
related to this Agreement or any agreements entered into to effectuate the
Pre-Closing Restructuring, the negotiation or execution hereof, or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any agreements entered into to
effectuate the Pre-Closing Restructuring (in each case other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Seller Debt Financing), and no Party or any of its
respective Affiliates (including, in the case of the Buyer after the Closing,
the Acquired Companies) shall have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse,
at law or in equity, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, it being agreed
that all of such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are expressly
waived and released by the Parties, on behalf of themselves and their
respective Affiliates (including, in the case of the Buyer after the Closing,
the Acquired Companies), to the fullest extent permitted by Law; _provided_ ,
that nothing in this Section 11.7 shall limit the right of any Party to (a)
specific performance or injunctive relief pursuant to Section 13.13, (b) any
Purchase Price adjustment claims made pursuant to Section 2.4, (c) any claims
pursuant to Section 7.5, (d) any claims of the Parties as expressly
contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements or the Seller Debt Financing
Documents (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken
by each such named party in the

 



      
 

 



 

Ancillary Agreements or the Seller Debt Financing Documents) or (e) any claims
against a Party for its Fraud.

 



 

Section 11.8 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Indemnification by the Buyer_. From and after the Closing, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 11.3, the Buyer shall be liable for and pay,
and shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees against, any and all Damages

Buyer or any of its Affiliates on the Closing Date but after the Closing that

Taxes pursuant to Section 11.8(i).

 



 

(b) _Indemnification by the Seller_. From and after the Closing, subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 11.3, the Seller shall be liable for and
pay, and shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees against, any and all Damages
arising out of (i) (A) Taxes of any Acquired Company for taxable periods (or
portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Taxes_
") and (B) Taxes of the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) for any taxable period and (ii) without duplication, (A) Taxes of
any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which
an Acquired Company is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date by
reason of Liability under Regulations Sections 1.1502-6 or 1.1502-78 or a
comparable provision of foreign, state or local Tax Law, (B) the failure of
any of the representations or warranties contained in Section 4.16 to be true
and correct (determined without regard to any qualification related to
"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" contained therein), (C) breaches by
the Seller of any covenant in Section 6.1(i) or Section 11.8 (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any and all Damages with respect to Tax deductions or
similar Tax assets as a result of a breach by the Seller of Section 4.16(m) or
Section 11.8(h) or (m)), (D) Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing
Restructuring and (E) Taxes attributable to the Approved Restructuring in
excess of amounts that would have been incurred in the absence of such
Approved Restructuring. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (w) without duplication
of Section 11.3(c)(i), the Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify the
Buyer Indemnitees under this Section 11.8(b) with respect to any Tax
liabilities to the extent reflected and included in the Final Closing
Statement, (x) for the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall not indemnify and
hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to this Section 11.8(b) against
any Damages arising out of any Taxes that are attributable to any Buyer Tax
Act or to any breach by the Buyer of any covenant in Section 11.8, (y) for
purposes of this Section 11.8(b), Taxes shall include the amount of Taxes that
would have been paid but for the application of any credit or net operating
loss or capital loss deduction attributable to any taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date and (z) if an Asset Acquisition
Election is not made, the Sellers aggregate payment obligations under
Sections 11.8(e)(i) and (ii) and this Section 11.8(b) shall be reduced, but
not below zero, by the amount of any Tax savings realized by the Buyer
Indemnitees in the taxable year beginning immediately after the Closing Date,
as a result of any deductions or credits attributable to the payment or
exercise of stock options or restricted stock units described in Sections
4.13(a)(57) through (87) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(c) _Tax Indemnification Procedures_.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) After the Closing, each Party shall promptly notify the other Party in
writing of any demand, claim or notice of the commencement of an audit
received by such Party from any Governmental Authority or any other Person
with respect to Taxes for which such other Party is liable pursuant to Section
11.8(a) or Section 11.8(b); _provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to give
such notice will not affect such other Partys rights to indemnification under
this Article XI, except to the extent that such Party is actually and
materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain factual information
(to the extent known) describing the asserted Tax liability and shall include
copies of the relevant portion of any notice or other document received from
any Governmental Authority or any other Person in respect of any such asserted
Tax liability.

 



 

(ii) Payment by an indemnitor of any amount due to an indemnitee under Section
11.8 shall be made within fifteen (15) days following written notice by the

Authority or other applicable Person is due by the indemnitee; _provided_ ,
that the indemnitor shall not be required to make any payment earlier than
five (5) Business Days before it is due to the appropriate Governmental
Authority or other applicable Person. In the event the indemnitor fails to
timely make such payment, the indemnitor shall be required to pay the
indemnitee interest at the applicable statutory rate for underpayment of Taxes
with respect to the amount of such Tax from the date the payment was required
to be made until the date the indemnitor actually pays such amount to the
indemnitee.

 



 

(iii) All amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Section 11.8 shall be
paid promptly in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank
account designated by the indemnified party.

 



 

(d) _Tax Audits, Contests and Specified Tax Matters; Cooperation_.

 



 

(i) The Seller shall control the conduct, through counsel or an advisor of its
own choosing at its own expense, of any inquiry, claim, assessment, audit,
claim for refund or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any
asserted Tax liability or refund of Taxes with respect to the Acquired
Companies (other than the matters set forth on Section 6.1(i)(2) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter (the " _Specified Tax Matters_ ")) (each, a " _Contest_ ")
relating to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-
Closing Taxable Periods_ "), the Seller shall keep the Buyer reasonably
informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any such
Contest (other than any such Contest that relates to a consolidated, unitary
or combined Tax Return with respect to a jurisdiction where an Asset
Acquisition Election is made), and the Seller shall be able to settle,
compromise and/or concede such Contest in its sole discretion unless such
settlement, compromise or concession could reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including
any of the Acquired Companies) in a taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date, in which case the Seller shall not settle,
compromise or concede such Contest (or applicable portion thereof) without the
Buyers prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). In addition, the Seller shall control the conduct, through counsel
or an advisor of its own choosing at its own expense, of the Specified Tax
Matters, and the Buyer or its accountants will be kept timely informed and
will receive copies of all correspondence, notices or filings with respect to
the

 



      
 

 



 

Specified Tax Matters. The Seller shall take all actions in the manner as set
forth in Section 6.1(i)(2) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(ii) The Buyer shall control the conduct, through counsel or an advisor of its
own choosing at its own expense, of any Contest relating to a Straddle Period

Buyer shall, in good faith, allow the Seller to make comments to the Buyer
regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such Straddle Period
Contest, (C) the Buyer shall provide the Seller copies of all correspondence,
notices and other written material received from any Governmental Authority
with respect to such Contest and shall otherwise keep the Seller apprised of
all substantive developments with respect to such Contest, (D) the Buyer shall
provide the Seller with a copy of, and an opportunity to review and comment
on, all submissions made to a Governmental Authority in connection with such
Contest, (E) the Seller shall have the right to participate in such Straddle
Period Contest at its own expense, (F) the Buyer shall not settle, compromise
or concede such Straddle Period Contest (or portion thereof) without the prior
written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (G) with the written consent of the
Buyer in its sole discretion, the Seller shall have the right to assume
control of such Contest but shall not be able to settle, compromise and/or
concede such Contest (or portion thereof) without the written consent of the
Buyer not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(iii) From and after the Closing, the Seller and the Buyer shall, and the
Buyer shall cause each Acquired Company to, furnish or cause to be furnished
to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information
(including access to books and records) and assistance relating to the
Acquired Companies as is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax
Returns and the preparation, prosecution, defense or conduct of any Contest or
Specified Tax Matter. The Seller and the Buyer shall, and the Buyer shall
cause each Acquired Company to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the
conduct of any Contest, Specified Tax Matter or other proceeding involving or
otherwise relating to the Acquired Companies (or their income or assets) with
respect to any Tax and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney
and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this Section
11.8(d)(iii). Any information obtained under this Section 11.8(d)(iii) shall
be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a Contest, Specified Tax Matter
or other Tax proceeding.

 



 

(iv) From and after the Closing, each of the Buyer and the Acquired Companies
shall (a) use its reasonable efforts to properly retain and maintain the Tax
and accounting records of the Acquired Companies that relate to Pre-Closing
Taxable Periods or Straddle Periods for seven (7) years and shall thereafter
provide the Seller with ninety (90) days written notice prior to any
destruction, abandonment or disposition of all or any portions of such
records, (b) transfer such records to the Seller upon its written request
prior to any such destruction, abandonment or disposition and (c) allow the
Seller and its Affiliates and their respective agents and representatives, at
times and dates reasonably and mutually acceptable to the Parties, to from
time to time inspect and review such records as the Seller may deem necessary
or appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , that in all cases, such activities
are to be conducted by the Seller during normal business hours. Any
information obtained under this

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.8(d)(iv) shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a
Contest, Specified Tax Matter or other Tax proceeding.

 



 

(v) In the event of a conflict between this Section 11.8(d) and Section 11.4,
this Section 11.8(d) will control.

 



 

(e) _Preparation of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes_.

 



 

(i) The Seller at the Sellers expense shall prepare (or cause to be prepared)
and timely file (or cause to be timely filed) all Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to the Acquired Companies for Pre-
Closing Taxable Periods. The Seller shall be responsible for the payment of
any Taxes due in connection with the filing of such Tax Returns (and, to the
extent that Taxes are payable by an Acquired Company, shall remit such Taxes
to such Acquired Company for payment to the relevant taxing authority prior to
the due date of the applicable Tax Return), except in each case to the extent
reflected and included in the Final Closing Statement. The Seller shall
prepare all such Tax Returns that are non-income Tax Returns in accordance
with past practices (unless otherwise required by applicable Law). The Seller
shall submit all such Tax Returns with respect to jurisdictions where an Asset
Acquisition Election is not made (or, in the case of any such consolidated Tax
Return, the portion of such consolidated Tax Return that relates to the
Acquired Companies) to the Buyer for its review and comment at least ten (10)
days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due. No Tax Returns subject
to this Section 11.8(e)(i) shall be filed without the Buyers approval (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if the
filing of such Tax Return could reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any of the
Acquired Companies) in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after
the Closing Date.

 



 

(ii) With respect to Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Acquired Companies for Straddle Periods (" _Straddle Returns_
"), the Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to be
filed) such Straddle Returns in a manner consistent with the past practice of
the Acquired Companies (unless otherwise required by applicable Law), and the
Seller shall be responsible for the Pre-Closing Taxes due in respect of such
Straddle Returns, except to the extent reflected and included in the Final
Closing Statement. The Buyer shall notify the Seller of any amounts due from
the Seller in respect of any such Straddle Return no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the date on which such Straddle Return is due, and the
Seller shall, notwithstanding any dispute between the Parties, remit such
payment to the Buyer no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the date such
Straddle Return is due. In the event that the Seller fails to timely make such
payment, the Seller shall be required to pay the Buyer interest at the
applicable statutory rate for underpayment of Taxes with respect to the amount
of such Tax from the date the payment was required to be made until the date
the Seller actually pays such amount to the Buyer. No payment pursuant to this
Section 11.8(e)(ii) shall excuse the Seller from its indemnification
obligations pursuant to Section 11.8(b) if the amount of Taxes as ultimately
determined (on audit or otherwise) for the periods covered by such Straddle
Returns that are the responsibility of the Seller exceeds the amount of the
Sellers payment under this Section 11.8(e)(ii). The Buyer shall deliver any
such Straddle Return to the

 



      
 

 



 

Seller for its review and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) at least ten (10) days prior to the date on
which such Straddle Return is due.

 



 

(iii) If the Buyer or the Seller disputes any item on a Tax Return delivered
by the other Party pursuant to either Section 11.8(e)(i) or Section
11.8(e)(ii), it shall notify the other Party of such disputed item (or items)
and the basis for its objection no later than seven (7) days after delivery by
such other Party of such Tax Return to the disputing Party. The Parties shall
act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which the
relevant Tax Return is required to be filed. If the Parties cannot resolve any
disputed item within fifteen (15) days of notification of such disputed item,
the item in question shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by the Seller and the
Buyer. The Seller and the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Accounting Firm to render a written report resolving the matters
submitted to the Accounting Firm within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
such submission; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent a Tax Return must
be filed prior to the resolution of such disputed item, the Tax Return shall
be filed as prepared by the other Party but the Parties will file an amended
Tax Return to reflect the decisions of the Accounting Firm.

 



 

(iv) Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall (or shall cause or
permit the Acquired Companies to) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax
Return relating in whole or in part to the Acquired Companies with respect to
any Pre-Closing Taxable Period (or with respect to any Straddle Period),
without the written consent of the Seller, which consent (A) with respect to
Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Taxable Periods, may be withheld in the sole
discretion of the Seller and (B) with respect to Straddle Returns, shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a Tax Return must be amended as a result of and based upon the
resolution of a Contest or Specified Tax Matter, the Buyer agrees to amend
such Tax Return solely to reflect the resolution of such Contest or Specified
Tax Matter, and the Seller shall not withhold its consent to such amendment.

 



 

(f) _Straddle Periods; Certain Deductions_. For purposes of this Agreement, in
the case of any Taxes of the Acquired Companies that are payable with respect
to any Tax period that begins on or before and ends after the Closing Date (a
" _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any such Taxes that constitutes Pre-
Closing Taxes shall: (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon
or related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale,
transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of property
(real or personal, tangible or intangible), be deemed equal to the amount that
would be payable if the Tax year or period ended on the Closing Date; and (ii)
in the case of Taxes (other than those described in clause (i) above) that are
imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or assets of the
Acquired Companies or otherwise measured by the level of any item, be deemed
to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case
of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of clause (i) of the
preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item (including,
without limitation, the effect of any graduated rates of Tax to ensure that
the Tax rate applicable to the overall Straddle Period is given effect to both
portions of the Straddle Period) that is calculated on an annual basis shall
be allocated to the portion of

 



      
 

 



 

the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined
by multiplying the total amount of such item allocated to the Straddle Period
times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. In the
case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or
long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated
under this Section 11.8(f) shall be computed by reference to the level of such
items on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with past practice
of the Acquired Companies, to the extent applicable.

 



 

(g) _Refunds_.

 



 

(i) If an Acquired Company is entitled to claim a refund from a Governmental
Authority of Taxes in respect of any taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date or any other Taxes as to which the Seller
is responsible to indemnify pursuant to Section 11.8(b), it shall promptly
notify the Seller of the availability of such refund claim and, upon the
Sellers request and at the Sellers expense, shall make a timely claim to
such Governmental Authority for such refund. The Seller will be entitled to
any credits in lieu of refunds and refunds of Taxes in respect of any taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date or any other
Taxes as to which the Buyer Indemnitees have been indemnified by the Seller
pursuant to Section 11.8(b) (in each case, (w) including pursuant to a claim
for refund made pursuant to the preceding sentence, (x) including interest
received thereon from the applicable Governmental Authority, (y) except to the
extent such Taxes (and any interest) are reflected and included in the Final
Closing Statement and (z) reduced by any Taxes and reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses attributable to the receipt or realization of such refunds or
credits). The Buyer shall cause such refund or the amount of such credit to be
paid to the Seller promptly after it is received or applied against any Tax
Liability which relates to a taxable period (or the portion of a Straddle
Period) that begins after the Closing Date. To the extent a refund or credit
against Taxes that gave rise to a payment hereunder is subsequently disallowed
or otherwise reduced, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer the amount of such
disallowed or reduced refund or credit against Taxes, plus any penalties,
interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority with
respect thereto.

 



 

(ii) Except as provided in Section 11.8(g)(i), the Acquired Companies will be
entitled to any credits and refunds (including any interest received thereon)
in respect of any federal, state, provincial, local or foreign Tax Liability
of the Acquired Companies.

 



 

(h) _Section 336 and 338 Elections_.

 



 

(i) At the request of the Buyer, the Seller shall join with the Buyer in
making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the Regulations
and any corresponding or similar elections under state or local Tax Law with
respect to the actual or constructive purchase and sale hereunder of the
Capital Stock of Lucky and all other Acquired Companies organized in the
United States (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ "). Any such
request shall be made by the Buyer no later than one hundred and fifty (150)
days after the Closing Date. In the event the Buyer does not request that the
Seller join in making any Section 338(h)(10) Election, the remainder of the
provisions of this Section 11.8(h)(i) shall not apply. If

 



      
 

 



 

a Section 338(h)(10) Election is to be made, the Buyer will prepare and timely
file the IRS Form 8023 (or successor form) and any similar state or local
forms (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Forms_ ") with the applicable
Governmental Authority, and the Buyer will provide the Seller with a copy of
such filing. The Seller shall execute (or cause to be executed) and deliver to
the Buyer the Section 338(h)(10) Forms and any other documents or forms as are
necessary to effect and preserve the Section 338(h)(10) Election at least
forty-five (45) days prior to the date such Section 338(h)(10) Election is
required to be filed.

 



 

(ii) At the request of the Buyer, (x) the Seller and the Acquired Companies
shall enter into a written, binding agreement to make an election under
Section 336(e) of the Code and the Regulations and any corresponding or
similar elections under state or local Tax Law with respect to the actual or
constructive purchase and sale hereunder of the Capital Stock of Lucky and all
other Acquired Companies organized in the United States (collectively, the "
_Section 336(e) Election_ ") and (y) the Seller shall timely make the Section
336(e) Election in accordance with Section 1.336-2(h) of the Regulations (and
any corresponding provisions of state or local Tax Law) and provide the
Acquired Companies with a copy of such election on or before the due date of
Sellers consolidated federal income Tax Return for the taxable period that
includes the Closing Date. The Seller shall promptly provide the Buyer with a
copy of each such filed Section 336(e) Election. Any request for a Section
336(e) Election shall be made by the Buyer no later than no later than one
hundred and fifty (150) days after the Closing Date. The parties shall
cooperate with each other to take all actions necessary and appropriate
(including filing forms, returns, elections, schedules and other documents as
may be required) to effect and preserve timely elections in accordance with
Section 336(e) of the Code and the Regulations promulgated thereunder (or any
comparable provisions of state or local Tax Law) or any successor provisions.

 



 

(iii) If the Buyer makes an election under Section 338(g) of the Code and the
Regulations and any corresponding or similar elections under state or local
Tax Law with respect to the actual or constructive purchase and sale hereunder
of the Capital Stock of any Acquired Company organized outside the United
States (collectively, the " _Section 338(g) Election_ ", and together with any
Section 338(h)(10) Election or Section 336(e) Election, the " _Asset
Acquisition Election_ "), the Buyer shall promptly so notify the Seller.

 



 

(iv) If an Asset Acquisition Election is to be made, the Buyer shall prepare a
draft IRS Form 8883 (or successor form and any similar state, local or foreign
forms) allocating the "aggregate deemed sales price" or "aggregate deemed
asset disposition price," as applicable, with respect to the assets of the
Acquired Companies in accordance with Sections 336(e) or 338 of the Code and
the Regulations or comparable provisions for state or local Tax Law and shall
revise such allocation as required by applicable Tax Law so as to report any
matters that need updating (including Purchase Price adjustments, if any) (as
revised, the " _Form 8883_ "). The Buyer shall forward the draft Form 8883 to
the Seller, and the Seller shall have thirty (30) days to review the draft
Form 8883 (from the date of the last revision) and shall notify the Buyer of
any dispute with respect to the draft Form 8883. If the Seller objects to the
draft Form 8883, the Parties shall act in good faith to resolve any such
dispute prior to the due date of the Asset Acquisition Election. If the Seller
does not timely object to the draft Form 8883, or upon resolution of the
disputed items by the Parties, the draft Form 8883 shall become a " _Final
Form 8883_." If the Parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in
question shall be

 



      
 

 



 

resolved by the Accounting Firm. The Parties shall act in good faith to cause
the Accounting Firm to deliver a Final Form 8883 within thirty (30) days after
such submission, and the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
borne equally by the Seller and the Buyer. Any Form 8883 delivered by the
Accounting Firm shall be a Final Form 8883. The Parties shall (i) be bound by
all Final Forms 8883 for purposes of determining any Taxes and (ii) prepare
and file their Tax Returns on a basis consistent with the Final Forms 8883;
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the Buyer or
the Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax
authority based upon or arising out of the allocation in any Final Form 8883,
and neither the Seller nor the Buyer shall be required to litigate before any
court, any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax authority challenging
such allocation. No later than fifteen (15) days prior to the date such Forms
8883 and any related documentation are required to be filed under the
applicable Laws, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a copy of the Final
Form 8883 with respect to the Acquired Companies that will be included with
the Sellers consolidated federal income tax return for the taxable period
that includes the Closing Date.

 



 

(v) The Buyer and the Seller shall file, and shall cause their Affiliates to
file, all Tax Returns and statements, forms and schedules in connection
therewith in a manner consistent with the Asset Acquisition Election and the
Allocation Statement and shall take no position contrary thereto unless
required to do so by applicable Tax Laws or pursuant to the good faith
resolution of a Contest or Specified Tax Matter.

 



 

(i) _Conveyance Taxes_. All sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp,
registration, documentary, excise, real property transfer, or similar Taxes
incurred as a result of the Stock Purchase shall be borne by the Buyer. The
Buyer shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if required by applicable
Law, the Parties will, and will cause their Affiliates to, join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and all required change of ownership and
similar statements.

 



 

(j) _Termination of Tax Allocation Agreements_. Any and all Tax allocation or
sharing agreements or other agreements or arrangements relating to Tax matters
(other than the Transition Services Agreement) between any of the Acquired
Companies, on the one hand, and any other Person (including the Seller or any
of its Affiliates), on the other hand, shall be terminated as to the Acquired
Companies prior to the Closing Date and, from and after the Closing Date,
neither the Buyer nor any of the Acquired Companies shall be obligated to make
any payment pursuant to any such agreement or arrangement for any taxable
period.

 



 

(k) _Tax Elections_. From and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall not, and
shall cause each Acquired Company not to, without the prior consent of the
Seller (which may, in its sole and absolute discretion, withhold such
consent), make, cause or permit to be made any Tax election (other than the
Asset Acquisition Election contemplated in Section 11.8(h) or an election that
constitutes part of a Tax Return described in Section 11.8(e)(i) or Section
11.8(e)(ii) or adopt or change any method of accounting, in each case that is
effective on or before the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(l) _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Seller shall deliver to the Buyer at the Closing
a certificate, in compliance with Regulations Section 1.1445-2, certifying
that the transactions contemplated hereby are exempt from withholding under
Section 1445 of the Code.

Closing Date:

 



 

(a) if the Stock Purchase has not been consummated by June 9, 2014 (the "

contributed to, or resulted in, the failure to consummate the Stock Purchase
by such date;

this Agreement has materially contributed to or resulted in, the imposition of
such Order; or

institutes after the date hereof any Law (that has not been repealed) that
prohibits consummation of the Stock Purchase.

 



 

Section 12.3 _Termination by the Buyer_. This Agreement may be terminated by
the Buyer at any time before the Closing Date if the Seller breaches any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition to
Closing set forth in Section 10.1(a) or Section 10.1(b) and (ii) if curable,
has not been cured by the Seller within the earlier of (x) ten (10) Business
Days after the Sellers receipt of written notice of such breach from the
Buyer and (y) one (1) Business Day prior to the Termination Date, but in each
case only so long as the Buyer is not then in breach of representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach
would give rise to the failure of a condition to Closing set forth in Section
10.3(a) or Section 10.3(b).

 



 

Section 12.4 _Termination by the Seller_. This Agreement may be terminated by
the Seller at any time before the Closing Date:

 



 

(a) if the Buyer breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach (i) would give rise to
the failure of a

 



       
 

 



 

condition to Closing set forth in Section 10.3(a) or Section 10.3(b); and (ii)
if curable, has not been cured by the Buyer within the earlier of (i) ten (10)
Business Days after the Buyers receipt of written notice of such breach from
the Seller and (ii) one (1) Business Day prior to the Termination Date, but in
each case only so long as the Seller is not then in breach of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition to
Closing set forth in Section 10.2(a) or Section 10.2(b); or

 



 

(b) if all conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 10.1 and Section
10.2 have been satisfied (other than any condition the failure of which to be
satisfied has been materially contributed to by the breach of this Agreement
by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates and other than conditions that, by their
nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing and which were, at the time of
termination, capable of being satisfied) and the Buyer has failed to
consummate the Closing when otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.1.

 



 

Section 12.5 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to this Article XII, it shall become void and of no further force and effect,
with no liability on the part of any Party; except that (a) if such
termination results from the Willful Breach by any Party of this Agreement,
then such Party shall be fully liable for any Damages incurred or suffered by
the other Party as a result of such Willful Breach and (b) Section 6.9,
Section 7.2, Section 7.12(d), this Section 12.5, Article XIII and the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

enter this Agreement), shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law
principles thereof that would give effect to laws of another jurisdiction.

 



 

Section 13.3 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Service_. Subject to Section 13.13,
and except for any arbitration brought pursuant to Section 2.4 or Section 7.5,
each Party (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) (a) irrevocably and

Section 13.6 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the Parties. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, Sections 13.2, 13.3, 13.4, 13.6, 13.9 and
13.14 may not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse in
any respect to the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter without the prior
written consent of such party.

 



 

Section 13.7 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time before the Closing, the Buyer,
on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations of the other Party, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered under this Agreement
or (c) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the covenants
or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a
Party to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by such Party. The failure of any Party to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right,
power or privilege under this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 13.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits and
schedules hereto), the Seller Disclosure Letter, the Buyer Disclosure Letter,
the Ancillary Agreements, and the Confidentiality Agreement contain all of the
terms, conditions and representations and warranties agreed to by the Parties
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior or
contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, correspondence, undertakings,
understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. No
representation, warranty, inducement, promise, understanding or condition not
set forth in this Agreement has been made by any of the Parties. The Buyer has
not relied on the accuracy or completeness of any information provided except
as expressly provided for in the representations and warranties agreed to by
the Parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. Except for any
claims against a Party hereto based upon or arising from Fraud or Willful
Breach, the Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights,
liabilities and obligations respecting the subject matter hereof exclusively
in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement and
the Parties expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled
to any remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, the
Parties each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the justifiable
expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arms-length negotiations;
the Parties specifically acknowledge that no Party has any special
relationship with another party that would justify any expectation beyond that
of ordinary parties in an arms-length transaction. Except for any claims
against a Party hereto based upon or arising from Fraud or Willful Breach, the
sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (including any representations and
warranties set forth herein or in the Ancillary Agreements, made in connection
herewith or the Ancillary Agreements or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements) or any claim or cause of action
otherwise arising out of or related to the Stock Purchase shall be those
remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract only (as such
contractual remedies have been further limited or excluded pursuant to the
express terms of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements); and each of the
Parties hereby agrees that no Party shall have any remedies or cause of action
(whether in contract or in tort) for any statements, communications,
disclosures, failures to disclose, representations or warranties not set forth
in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

Section 13.9 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for Section 7.5, Section
7.9, Article VIII, Article XI, and this Article XIII, each of which shall be
for the benefit of the Persons identified therein, the Parties hereby agree
that their respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other Parties, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement
is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the
Parties any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sections 13.2, 13.3, 13.4, 13.6, 13.9 and 13.14 are intended to be
for the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter.

 



 

Section 13.10 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of that
provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable,

 



      
 

 



 

then (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted for that
provision in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision, and (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of that provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of that provision, or the application of that
provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

Section 13.11 _Rules of Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly
in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not constitute an
admission by such Party that such item is material, that such item has had or
would have a Material Adverse Effect or Buyer Material Adverse Effect, as the
case may be, or that the disclosure of such be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. The
representations, warranties and covenants made by the Parties in this
Agreement are qualified by information set forth in the sections of the Seller
Disclosure Letter which correspond to the applicable sections of this
Agreement and such other sections of this Agreement solely to the extent the
relevance of such disclosure to such sections is reasonably apparent on its
face. Representations and warranties may be used as a tool to allocate risks
between the Parties, including where the Parties do not have complete
knowledge of all facts. Investors of the Seller Group are not third-party
beneficiaries under the Agreement or under any of the Ancillary Agreements and
should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any
descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or
condition of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

 



 

Section 13.12 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their permitted successors and
assigns. No Party may assign or delegate, by operation of law or otherwise,
all or any portion of its rights or liabilities under this Agreement, without
the prior written consent of the other Parties, which any such party may
withhold in its absolute discretion. Any purported assignment without such
prior written consents shall be void; provided, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, all or any portion of the rights and obligations under this
Agreement may be assigned (i) by either Party, to a financial or lending
institution for collateral purposes or (ii) by Buyer to (A) any of its
Affiliates or (B) to any acquiror of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (by
merger, consolidation, sale of stock or assets or otherwise), but no such
assignment or delegation shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations
hereunder, and the prior written consent of the Seller shall be required for
any such assignment or delegation that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, impair or delay the Transactions.

 



 

Section 13.13 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Chosen Courts, this being in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity,
and the Parties hereby waive any requirement for the posting of any bond or
similar collateral in connection therewith.

 



      
 

 



 

Without limitation of the foregoing, the Parties hereby further acknowledge
and agree that prior to the Closing the Seller shall be entitled to specific
performance to cause the Buyer to draw down the full proceeds of the Equity
Financing pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity
Commitment Letter and to cause the Buyer to consummate the Stock Purchase
(only to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 3.1) to the extent the
conditions to the consummation of the Stock Purchase and the funding of such
proceeds under this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter, respectively,
are satisfied and the Closing is required to occur under Section 3.1. Each
Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (a) the other Party
has an adequate remedy at law, or (b) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 



 

Section 13.14 _No Recourse_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
the Equity Commitment Letter or in the Guarantee (and then only to the extent
of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement,
the Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter and not otherwise), this
Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action
based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement may only be made
against the entities that are expressly identified as Parties hereto and no
