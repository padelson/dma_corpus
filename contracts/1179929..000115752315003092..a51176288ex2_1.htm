2.4.4 Resolution of Disputes. Buyer and PSC will in good faith attempt to
promptly resolve the matters raised in any Dispute Notice and agree upon the
Final Purchase Price (as defined below). Beginning twenty (20) Business Days
after delivery of any Dispute Notice pursuant to Section 2.4.3, either Buyer
or PSC may provide written notice to the other (the "Dispute Submission
Notice") that it elects to submit the disputed items to a nationally
recognized independent accounting firm that is not at the time it is to be
engaged hereunder rendering services to any Party, or any Affiliate thereof,
and has not done so within the two year period prior thereto, chosen jointly
by Buyer and PSC (the "Accounting Firm"). In the event that an Accounting Firm
has not been selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and PSC within ten (10)
Business Days following the giving of the Dispute Submission Notice, each of
Buyer and PSC shall promptly select an accounting firm and promptly cause such
two accounting firms to mutually select a third independent accounting firm to
act as the Accounting Firm within twenty (20) Business Days of the giving of
the Dispute Submission Notice. The Accounting Firm will promptly, in
accordance with the rules set forth in the Accounting Firm's engagement letter
and its customary practices, review only those unresolved items and amounts
specifically set forth and objected to in the Dispute Notice and resolve the
dispute with respect to each such specific unresolved item and amount in
accordance with this Agreement. In any such case, a single partner of the
Accounting Firm selected by such Accounting Firm in accordance with its normal
procedures and having expertise with respect to settlement of such disputes
and the industry in which the Acquired Companies operate shall act for the
Accounting Firm in the determination proceeding, and the Accounting Firm shall
render a written decision as to each disputed matter, including a statement in
reasonable detail of the basis for its decision and its calculation of the
Final Purchase Price (as defined below) based on such decision. In no event
shall the decision of the Accounting Firm (i) provide for a calculation of any
element of the Purchase Price that is less than the lower calculation thereof
shown in the Proposed Final Closing Statement or in the Dispute Notice or
greater than the higher calculation thereof shown in the Proposed Final
Closing Statement or in the Dispute Notice. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne by the party whose aggregate position with
respect to the Final Purchase Price is further from the Final Purchase Price
as determined by the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.4.4 or, if the
positions of each party with respect to the Final Purchase price are
equidistant from the Final Purchase Price as determined by the Accounting Firm
pursuant to this Section 2.4.4, then the fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be borne equally by the parties. The decision of the Accounting
Firm with respect to the disputed items of the Proposed Final Closing
Statement submitted to it will be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties, absent manifest error or fraud. Each of the parties to this Agreement
agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the
Accounting Firm (including by executing a customary engagement letter
reasonably acceptable to it) and to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve any
such dispute as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Accounting
Firm's engagement.

shall mean (i) if a Dispute Notice is not delivered within the forty-five (45)
calendar day period provided in Section 2.4.3, the Purchase Price reflected in
the Proposed Final Closing Statement as prepared by Buyer or (ii) if such a
Dispute Notice is delivered within the forty-five (45) calendar day period

respect to any matters raised in the Dispute Notice that are resolved by the
Accounting Firm in accordance with Section 2.4.4. If the Final Purchase Price
differs from the Estimated Purchase Price set forth in the Estimated Closing
Statement, (A) Buyer shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to PSC, on its own behalf and on behalf of Ross, the amount, if any, by which
such Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price or (B) PSC, on
its own behalf and on behalf of Ross, shall pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to Buyer the amount, if any, by which such
Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price. Any such payment
shall be made within five (5) Business Days following the determination of the
Final Purchase Price.

  

  

2.4.6 Indemnification Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the determination of the Cash on Hand, the Net Working
Capital, the Closing Indebtedness, the unpaid Company Transaction Expenses and
the Purchase Price, as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.4,
shall not preclude Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Person, as the case may be,
from pursuing indemnification (without duplication, including with respect to
liabilities counted in the calculation of Net Working Capital) for the breach
of any representation, warranty or other covenant pursuant to Article 9 for
any matters otherwise indemnifiable thereunder.

  

  

2.5 Escrow. At Closing, the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be delivered to the
Escrow Agent, who shall hold and release such amount, and all interest, and
other amounts earned thereon (the total of such amounts in the account, at any
given time, the "Indemnity Escrow Fund"), in escrow pursuant to and in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, on the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the Closing Date, any
remaining amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, less the aggregate amount, if
any, of outstanding claims that have been made by any Buyer Indemnified Person
in accordance with Article 9 shall be released by the Escrow Agent to PSC, on
its own behalf and on behalf of Ross.

7.3 Confidentiality.

  

  

7.3.1 Confidentiality Agreement. The provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, to the extent not inconsistent with the express terms of this
Agreement, are hereby ratified, confirmed and agreed to as though fully set
forth herein. The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect until the
Closing, at which point it shall terminate, or if this Agreement is
terminated, until the expiration of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

7.3.2 Announcements. Any public announcements, reports, statements or press
releases by any party hereto or any of its Affiliates regarding the
Contemplated Transactions must be approved in advance (as to form, content,
timing and manner of distribution) by each of Buyer and PSC, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, that any
party may issue a press release or make a public announcement to the extent
necessary for such party to comply with applicable securities Legal
Requirements, and, to the extent practicable, shall provide a copy to PSC (if
such party is Buyer or, after the Closing, any of the Companies) or Buyer (if
such party is PSC or, prior to the Closing, any of the Companies) in advance
of its release.

  

  

7.3.3 Post-Closing Confidentiality. For a period of five (5) years after the
Closing Date (and indefinitely with respect to Trade Secrets), none of the
Sellers nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives will
disclose, divulge or make use of any Trade Secrets or other confidential or
non-public information of a business, financial, marketing, technical or other
proprietary nature pertaining to Buyer, the Acquired Companies or the
Business, including information of third-parties that any of the Acquired
Companies has agreed to keep confidential, in each case, that was made
available to or to which any of the Sellers, their respective Affiliates or
any of their respective Representatives had access to on or prior to the
Closing Date, except (a) to the extent that such information shall have become
generally available to the public other than by breach of this Agreement by
any of the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives
and (b) to the extent that disclosure of such information is required by Legal
Requirement or any of the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives is requested or required by a Governmental Authority or in
connection with any Action to make such disclosure (but only after Buyer has
been provided with reasonable notice and opportunity to take action against
any such disclosure).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-46-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.4 Preparation for Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each
of the Sellers and Buyer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary or desirable under applicable Legal Requirements to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions as promptly as practicable, including preparing and
filing as promptly as practicable with the applicable Governmental Authorities
all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents necessary to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. In
furtherance (and not in limitation) of the foregoing:

  

  

7.4.1 Antitrust Matters. Each of the Sellers and Buyer agrees to file all
appropriate notifications and filings pursuant to the HSR Act or any
applicable foreign antitrust and competition Legal Requirements with respect
to the Contemplated Transactions in the most expeditious manner practicable,
but in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof and
to supply promptly any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested of such party by the relevant Governmental Authorities in
connection with the HSR Act or any applicable foreign antitrust and
competition Legal Requirements. PSC, on its own behalf and on behalf of Ross,
and Buyer shall pay fifty percent (50%) of all filing fees associated with the
HSR filings and any applicable foreign antitrust and competition Legal
Requirements. Each of the Sellers and Buyer will use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve favorably any review or consideration of the antitrust
aspects of the Contemplated Transactions by any Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over the enforcement of any applicable antitrust Legal
Requirements. Each of the Sellers and Buyer agrees not to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
United States or foreign Governmental Authority in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance,
if at all possible, and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.
Each Seller and Buyer will consult and cooperate with one another, and will
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
communication, appearance, presentation, argument, proposal, or other
submission made to a Governmental Authority in connection with any
investigation or proceeding under the HSR Act or any applicable foreign
antitrust and competition Legal Requirements relating to the Contemplated
Transactions. Each Seller and Buyer will promptly inform each other of any
communication to or from Governmental Authorities and supply each other with
copies of all correspondence, filings or communications with Governmental
Authorities, with respect to the Contemplated Transactions; provided, that to
the extent any of the documents or information are commercially or
competitively sensitive, such Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, may satisfy
its obligations by providing such documents or information to the other
party's outside antitrust counsel, with the understanding that such antitrust
counsel shall not share such documents and information with its client
(although such antitrust counsel may use such documents and information in
advocating on behalf of its client with any Governmental Authority). In the
interest of clarity, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be
obligated to: (i) offer, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree,
hold separate order, trust or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or
other disposition of any capital stock, assets, rights, products or
businesses; (ii) agree to any restrictions on the activities of Buyer or its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, any of the Companies); (iii) waive
any rights to which they are entitled; (iv) pay any amount; (v) defend
commence or prosecute any Action; or (vi) take any other action to prevent,
effect the dissolution of, vacate, or lift any decree, order, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or
proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-47-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.4.2 Certain Filings, Etc. Each of the Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with
one another (a) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from third parties to any
Material Company Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions, and (b) in taking such actions or making any such
filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking
timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers; provided,
that nothing in this Agreement shall obligate or be construed to obligate any
Acquired Company to make or cause to be made any payment or concession to any
third party in order to obtain any such action, consent, approval or waiver
under any Material Company Contract; provided, further, that the obtaining of
any such consents, approvals or waivers shall not be deemed to be conditions
to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Contemplated Transactions
unless set forth on Section 5.10 of the Disclosure Schedules. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, each Seller shall be required to take all actions
necessary or appropriate to release the Acquired Companies as guarantors under
any line of credit outstanding as of the date hereof, such releases shall be a
condition to the obligation of Buyer to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions.

  

  

7.5 Notice of Certain Events. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing Date, each party hereto shall promptly notify the
other party hereto of (a) any representation or warranty made by such party
hereunder not being true and correct which would reasonably be expected to
result in the failure to satisfy any condition to the obligations of any party
to effect the Contemplated Transactions, (b) the failure of any Acquired
Company, Buyer or any Seller, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in the
failure to satisfy any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the
Contemplated Transactions, (c) any action, suit, claim, investigation or
proceeding commenced, threatened in writing against, relating to or involving
or otherwise affecting such party that, if pending on the date hereof, would
have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, in each
case, to Sellers' Knowledge; and (d) any written notice or other written
communication from any Person or Governmental Authority alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions. The parties hereby acknowledge that the Indemnified
Parties do not and shall not waive any rights they may have hereunder as a
result of any notification given pursuant to this Section 7.5.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-48-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.6 Business Records. Buyer acknowledges that a Seller may from time to time
from and after the Closing require access to the Records, and agrees that upon
reasonable prior notice, it will, and will ensure that the Acquired Companies
will, during normal business hours, provide such Seller and its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives with either access to or copies of the
Records. If the Acquired Companies shall desire to dispose of any such Records
prior to the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or
shall cause the Companies to, prior to any such disposition, notify such
Seller and provide to such Seller (or, if applicable, its designee) and its
Representatives a reasonable opportunity, at such Seller's expense, to make
copies of or remove such Records.

  

  

7.7 Conflict of Interest; Attorney-Client Privilege. Buyer, on behalf of its
itself and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies following the
Closing) (Buyer and all such other Persons, "Buyer Related Parties") hereby
waives, any claim that Paul Hastings LLP ("Prior Company Counsel") in
connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions ("Pre-Closing
Representation") has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from
representing any Seller or any of their respective officers, directors,
members, managers or Affiliates ("Seller Related Parties") in any dispute with
any Buyer Related Parties or any other matter involving this Agreement or its
subject matter or the Contemplated Transactions, in each case, after the
Closing Date, even though the interests of one or more of the Seller Related
Parties in such dispute or other matter may be directly adverse to the
interests of one or more Buyer Related Parties and even though Prior Company
Counsel may have represented one or more of the Acquired Companies in a matter
substantially related to such dispute or other matter and may be handling
ongoing matters for one or more Buyer Related Parties. Buyer, on behalf of the
Buyer Related Parties, hereby covenants and agrees, that, as to all
communications between any Prior Company Counsel, on the one hand, and any
Seller Related Parties or any Acquired Company (with respect to the Acquired
Companies, solely prior to the Closing), on the other hand, that relate in any
way to the Pre-Closing Representation, the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belong to and shall be controlled by the
applicable Seller, and shall not pass to or be claimed by any Buyer Related
Parties. This Section 7.7 shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect
following the Closing. Without limitation of the foregoing, no Buyer Related
Parties may use or rely on any privileged communications described in the
immediately preceding sentence in any claim, dispute, action, suit or
proceeding against or involving any of the Seller Related Parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after the Closing a dispute arises between
Buyer or the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and a third party other than
(and unaffiliated with) Seller, on the other hand, then the Companies (to the
extent applicable) may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure to such third party of confidential communications by Prior Company
Counsel; provided, however, that neither Buyer nor any Acquired Company may
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the applicable
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. This Section 7.7 is for the benefit of the Seller Related Parties
and each Prior Company Counsel, and the Seller Related Parties and each Prior
Company Counsel are express third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.7.
This Section 7.7 shall be irrevocable, and no term of this Section 7.7 may be
amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent of the
applicable Seller and Prior Company Counsel affected thereby. For avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.7 do not apply to any
representation by Prior Company Counsel in connection with any matter other
than the Pre-Closing Representation, including any representation in a matter
involving any person other than one of the Buyer Related Parties or one of the
Seller Related Parties.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-49-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.8 Transfer Taxes. PSC on behalf of the Sellers shall be responsible for all
Transfer Taxes (as well as the filing of all Tax Returns with respect thereto)
in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

  

  

7.9 Tax Matters

  

  

7.9.1 Tax Returns. Following the Closing, PSC shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and timely file or cause to be timely filed, all income Tax Returns
that are required to be filed for the Acquired Companies that relate to (or
include) any Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on or before the Closing Date (but
excluding any Straddle Tax Period Return) and that are due after the Closing
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, such income Tax Returns will include those
listed on Section 7.9.1 of the Disclosure Schedules. Any such income Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with all positions taken,
methods used, and elections made in prior periods in filing income tax returns
for the Acquired Companies except as otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements (including without limitation, compliance with Code Section 482
and any related Code provisions, Treasury Regulations thereunder and any
comparable provisions of state Tax law) and before filing any such income tax
return, PSC shall provide Buyer with a copy of such income Tax Return at least
forty-five (45) days prior to the last date for timely filing such income Tax
Return (giving effect to any valid extensions thereof); provided, that Buyer
fully complies with Section 7.9.4 hereof regarding providing PSC with the
necessary information to prepare such Tax Returns. Except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement or in connection with a breach or inaccuracy in any
representation, warranty or covenant of any of the Sellers, none of the
Sellers shall have any liability under this Agreement (including via the
Ancillary Agreements) with respect to (a) any Taxes that were taken into
account in the calculation of Net Working Capital, (b) Taxes incurred as a
result of actions outside the ordinary course unilaterally taken by Buyer
after the Closing which are not contemplated by this Agreement (including any
Tax elections made unilaterally by Buyer or which Buyer unilaterally causes
the Acquired Companies to make) or otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements or (c) Taxes incurred by the Acquired Companies after the Closing
Date. Following the Closing and except as otherwise required by applicable
Legal Requirements, neither Buyer nor any Acquired Company shall amend any Tax
Return to the extent that such Tax Return relates to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period without the prior written consent of PSC. Buyer shall, if PSC
reasonably requests and at the sole expense of PSC, cause the relevant
Acquired Company to file an amended separate Tax Return for the purpose of
obtaining any Tax refund to which PSC would be entitled under Section 7.9.3 so
long as such amended Tax Return is prepared in compliance with applicable
Legal Requirements and, if made on an elective basis by PSC and not required
by any Governmental Authority in connection with or to conform to a federal,
state or local audit result, is not reasonably likely to result in an adverse
Tax consequence to Buyer or any Acquired Company with respect to any Taxable
period ending after the Closing Date. Buyer and PSC shall reasonably cooperate
in connection with the filing of any such amended Tax return in accordance
with Section 7.9.4.

  

  

7.9.2 Allocation of Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes incurred
during a tax period that begins before and ends after Closing (each such tax
period, a "Straddle Tax Period") shall be allocated to the pre-Closing portion
thereof constituting a Pre-Closing Tax Period as follows: (a) ad valorem Taxes
for such period shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the full tax
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
during the pre-Closing partial tax period and the denominator of which is the
number of days during the full tax period; and (b) Taxes (other than the Taxes
referred to in clause (a)) for the pre-Closing partial tax period shall be
computed as if such taxable period ended on the Closing Date under the
closing-of-the-books method. All Straddle Tax Period Tax Returns will be
prepared consistently with prior Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies and
PSC, including accounting methods and conventions, in each case to the extent
the same are in compliance with applicable Legal Requirements (including
without limitation, compliance with Code Section 482, Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, related Code provisions and comparable provisions of
state Tax law).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-50-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.9.3 Refunds. Except in the case of any refund of Taxes with respect to an
Acquired Company as a result of the carryback of any Tax item from a taxable
period after the Closing (including the portion after the Closing of any such
period that includes the Closing) to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, any refunds
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, overpayments of estimated Taxes) of
Taxes of, or with respect to, the Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period that were paid by PSC and not taken into account as a current asset in
calculating Net Working Capital will be for the benefit of PSC, and Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Company or any other Acquired Company to forward the
amount of any such refunds actually received by Buyer or any Acquired Company
(whether in the form of a refund or as a credit against or an offset of Taxes
otherwise payable by Buyer with respect to any Taxable period ending after the
Closing), together with any interest thereon actually received by Buyer, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds within thirty (30) days of
receiving such refund or benefit thereof to PSC. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, that any refund of Taxes that is received as a result of the
carryback of any Tax item from a taxable period after the Closing (including
the portion after the Closing of any such period that includes the Closing) to
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall belong exclusively to Buyer or the applicable
Acquired Company and, if received by PSC, shall be promptly delivered by PSC
to Buyer or the applicable Acquired Company. For the avoidance of doubt, this
Section 7.9.3 shall not apply to Tax credits.

  

  

7.9.4 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Subject to Section 7.1.2, Buyer and each
Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, provide each
other with such cooperation and information as any of them reasonably may
request in connection with any Tax matters relating to the Acquired Companies.
Such cooperation and information will include providing copies of relevant Tax
Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related
work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
Taxing Authorities, including Buyer providing to a Seller all information
reasonably requested by such Seller as needed for such Seller to prepare any
Tax Returns and, subject to receipt from Seller on the Closing Date of all
Records and other information reasonably necessary in connection therewith
(and promptly upon request from Buyer of information desirable in connection
therewith), Buyer providing such Seller with depreciation schedules relating
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the Closing Date. Except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, information so requested shall be provided as
promptly as reasonably practical, but in no event later than seventy-five (75)
days after the Closing Date; provided however, that on or before the Closing
Date, Sellers shall provide the Companies with all Records and information
necessary (and promptly upon request from Buyer of information so desirable)
for Buyer to prepare the depreciation schedules for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
ending on the Closing Date. Each Seller will retain and make available to
Buyer all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents
in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Acquired Companies for all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods until the expiration of the statute of limitations of
the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate. Any
information obtained under this Section 7.9.4 will be kept confidential except
as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or
claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-51-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.9.5 Tax Election.

  

  

(a) If Buyer so requests, Sellers shall join with Buyer in a joint Section
338(h)(10) Election with respect to the purchase and sale of Equity Interests
of one or more eligible Acquired Companies and Seller shall include any
income, gain, loss, deduction, or other tax item resulting from a Section
338(h)(10) Election on Sellers' Tax Returns to the extent required by
applicable law and (ii) PSC shall cause the applicable Acquired Company to pay
any Tax imposed on such Acquired Company attributable to the making of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election. Buyer shall deliver to Sellers all the Section
338 Forms properly completed in accordance with all applicable Laws no less
than fifteen (15) days before the date such Section 338 Forms are required to
be filed and Sellers shall duly execute and timely file such forms. If a
Section 338(h)(10) Election is made, Sellers, the applicable Acquired Company
and Buyer agree that the Tax Purchase Price for such Acquired Company (plus
other relevant items) as defined in Section 7.9.7 will be allocated to the
assets of each Acquired Company for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election is
made in accordance with Section 7.9.7. If a Section 338(h)(10) Election is
made, PSC, the applicable Acquired Company and Buyer shall file all Tax
Returns (including amended returns and claims for refund) and information
reports in a manner consistent with such allocation. If the Section 338(h)(10)
Election is made, to the extent permitted by state, local or foreign Tax laws,
(i) the principles and procedures hereof relating to the Section 338(h)(10)
Election shall apply to any equivalent or comparable provision under the Tax
laws of such other jurisdiction, and (ii) Sellers as reasonably required shall
cooperate and join in any election made by any of the Companies or Buyer to
effect such an election so as to treat the purchase contemplated by this
Agreement as a purchase of assets under the Tax laws of such other
jurisdiction.

  

  

(b) With respect to every Section 338(h)(10) Election, Buyer and the
Companies, jointly and severally, shall pay to PSC in cash the amount of total
additional consideration necessary to cause PSC's after-Tax net proceeds
(including any Tax on income attributable to the receipt of the Tax adjustment
described in this Section 7.9.5(b)) from the sale of the Equity Interests of
each applicable Acquired Company with all federal and state Section 338(h)(10)
Elections to be equal to the after-Tax net proceeds that PSC would have
received had no Section 338(h)(10) Elections been made, taking into account
all otherwise applicable state, federal, foreign and local Tax implications,
including any Taxes imposed on the applicable Acquired Company by reason of
the Section 338(h)(10) Election (the "Tax Adjustment"). PSC, Buyer and the
Acquired Company shall cooperate in good faith to minimize the amount of the
Tax Adjustment; provided that PSC shall not be required to incur material
risk, liability, loss or expense to minimize the amount of the Tax Adjustment.
In calculating the Tax Adjustment with respect to an Acquired Company for
which Section 338(h)(10) Election is made, (i) only items of income, gain,
deduction, loss and expense arising out of the Contemplated Transactions shall
be considered, and (ii) PSC shall be treated as subject to the maximum
combined federal, state, local and foreign marginal income Tax rate (net of
federal benefit) applicable to PSC with respect to the applicable Acquired
Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-52-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than one hundred twenty
(120) days after the Closing Date, PSC shall cause PSC's outside accountants
to prepare and deliver to Buyer a schedule computing the amount of the Tax
Adjustment which would be payable for each Acquired Company which is eligible
for a Section 338(h)(10) Election if such an election is made (the "Tax
Adjustment Schedule") based on the allocation of the Purchase Price among the
assets of the Companies in accordance with Section 7.9.7. During the thirty
(30) days following the receipt by Buyer of the Tax Adjustment Schedule,
Buyer's agents, accountants and representatives shall be permitted to review
the working papers of PSC's accountants relating to the Tax Adjustment
Schedule, but not including Tax Returns of PSC or its Affiliates. PSC and
PSC's accountants shall cooperate with Buyer and its agents, accountants and
representatives in facilitating such review. Buyer shall give any comments or
objections it has with respect to the Tax Adjustment Schedule to PSC and PSC's
outside accountants. Such comments or objections, insofar as they relate
directly or indirectly to the amount of the Tax Adjustment, shall be resolved
without regard to any materiality standard, and the final Tax Adjustment
Schedule delivered to Buyer pursuant to the provisions of the next paragraph
shall reflect such resolution.

  

  

(d) Within seven (7) days after the expiration of such thirty (30) day period,
PSC shall deliver to Buyer the final Tax Adjustment Schedule. Within ten (10)
days after receipt of such final Tax Adjustment Schedule, Buyer shall deliver
a letter to PSC stating whether it concurs with such final Tax Adjustment
Schedule and listing Buyer's exceptions thereto, if any, together with the
reasons therefor. If such objections cannot be resolved between Buyer and PSC
within ten days after delivery of such letter by Buyer, the questions or
questions in dispute shall then be submitted, as soon as practicable, to a
neutral arbitrator selection in accordance with Section 7.9.7, the decision of
which as to such question or questions in dispute shall be final and binding
upon PSC and Buyer; provided that the arbitrator's determination shall be
limited to choosing the position either of the Buyer or PSC with respect to
the amount in dispute. The fees of any arbitrator shall be borne by PSC and
Buyer, in such amount(s) as shall be determined by the arbitrator based on the
proportion that the aggregate amount of disputed items submitted to the
arbitrator that is unsuccessfully disputed by PSC or Buyer as determined by
the arbitrator, bears to the total amount of such disputed items so submitted.

  

  

(e) Within five (5) days after the later of resolution of all disputes with
respect to the final Tax Adjustment Schedule or Sellers' timely filing of the
duly executed Section 338 Forms in accordance with Section 7.9.5(a), Buyer and
the Companies, jointly and severally, shall pay to PSC by wire transfer of
immediately available funds the amount of the Tax Adjustment with respect to
each Section 338(h)(10) Election requested by Buyer.

7.9.6 Tax Claims. Buyer shall promptly notify PSC in writing of the
commencement of any audit or examination of any income Tax Return of the
Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period on or before the Closing
Date and any other proposed change or adjustment, claim, dispute, arbitration
or litigation that, if sustained, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
a claim for indemnification in respect of Taxes under this Agreement (a "Tax
Claim"). Such notice shall describe the asserted Tax Claim in reasonable
detail and shall include copies of any notices and other documents received
from any Taxing Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax Claim. At PSC's
sole expense, PSC shall have the right to control any Tax Claims in the Tax
audit, examination, and settlement stage and, if not settled, in any further
contest; provided, however, that PSC shall inform Buyer of the status and
progress of such Tax Claim and Buyer shall have the right to participate in
any such audit examination or other proceeding. PSC may not settle any Tax
Claim (either at the audit or examination stage or thereafter) without first
obtaining Buyer's consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). In the event that PSC does not exercise its right to
control any Tax Claim, Buyer shall control such Tax Claim; provided, however,
that Buyer shall inform PSC of the status and progress of such Tax Claim and
PSC will have the opportunity to participate in such Tax Claim at its expense.
Buyer shall not settle any Tax Claim (either at the audit or examination stage
or thereafter) without first obtaining PSC's written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

7.9.7 Allocation of Tax Purchase Price.

  

  

(a) The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Acquired Companies in the
amounts set forth on Section 7.9.7 of the Disclosure Schedules. In the event
that the Final Purchase Price is more or less than the sum of the amounts set
forth on Section 7.9.7 of the Disclosure Schedules, such Final Purchase Price
shall be allocated among the Acquired Companies in proportion to the
respective allocations set forth on Section 7.9.7 of the Disclosure Schedules.
Buyer and PSC acknowledge that the purchase and sale of the Interests will be
treated as a purchase and sale of the assets of the Companies for federal and
state income tax purposes. Buyer and PSC shall timely file Forms 8594 with the
IRS in accordance with the requirements of Section 1060 of the Code and that
are prepared consistent with the allocations determined pursuant to this
Section 7.9.7 reflecting allocation of the sum of the Purchase Price and any
liability or other amount included in the amount realized by PSC or cost basis
to Buyer with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Tax Purchase Price"). Within seventy-five (75) days following the Closing
Date, PSC shall deliver to Buyer PSC's proposed schedule (the "Allocation
Schedule") with respect to each Acquired Company that is eligible for a
338(h)(10) Election or is treated as disregarded as an entity separate from
its respective Seller for federal income tax purposes. The Allocation Schedule
shall specify PSC's determination of how the Tax Purchase Price allocated to
each such Acquired Company in accordance with Section 7.9.7 of the Disclosure
Schedules shall be allocated among each designated class of assets of such
Acquired Company as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-6(b)(2) and
in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1060-1 and applicable Legal
Requirements. Any redetermination of the Tax Purchase Price within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-7 shall be made as required thereby and
shall be taken into account by Buyer and PSC in carrying out the provisions of
this Section 7.9.7. In the event that the allocation of the Tax Purchase Price
has not been fully determined in accordance with this Section 7.9.7 by the
time the income Tax Returns of Buyer or PSC are required to be filed (taking
available extensions of time into account), then to the extent not so
determined, Buyer and PSC shall each file its Tax Returns based on its good
faith determination; and if the final determination of the allocation pursuant
to this Section 7.9.7 varies from the manner in which Buyer or PSC prepared
such Tax Returns, then it shall file an amendment of such Tax Returns in order
to make the Tax Returns as so filed consistent with the allocation of the Tax
Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this Section 7.9.7. Except
(i) pursuant to a final determination (within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code or corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax law) or
(ii) with respect only to an Acquired Company for which a Section 338(h)(10)
Election has been made or which is otherwise treated as an asset sale for
federal income Tax purposes, in accordance with a written opinion of legal
counsel of national reputation and not having represented either Buyer or
Seller in these Contemplated Transactions to the effect that failing to take
such inconsistent position with respect to the allocation of value pursuant to
Code Section 1060 as to the assets of such Acquired Company would subject
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, to Tax penalties, the Parties shall make
consistent use of the allocation as agreed or determined pursuant to this
Section 7.9.7 for all Tax purposes and in all filings, declarations and
reports with the IRS and other taxing authorities in respect thereof. In any
Action involving a Taxing Authority related to the determination of any Tax,
neither Buyer nor PSC shall contend or represent that such allocation is not
correct.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-54-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Buyer shall not object to the Allocation Schedule proposed by PSC except
on grounds that such Allocation Schedule fails to conform to the requirements
of this Section 7.9.7. Any disagreements regarding the allocation required by
this Section 7.9.7 which cannot be resolved within thirty (30) days of PSC's
delivery of the Allocation Schedule shall be submitted for final and binding
resolution to a tax partner at the Accounting Firm (the "Tax Arbitrator"). The
Tax Arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and PSC;
provided that if the parties are unable to agree on a Tax Arbitrator, each
party shall select a person qualified to act as a Tax Arbitrator and such
individuals together shall select the Tax Arbitrator. The Tax Arbitrator shall
have no authority modify the Allocation Schedule proposed by PSC unless the
Tax Arbitrator determines that such proposed Allocation Schedule does not
conform to the requirements of this Section 7.9.7. The Tax Arbitrator will
only consider those matters as to which Buyer and PSC have disagreed and must
resolve the matters in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Allocation Schedule. Buyer and PSC each shall submit to the Tax Arbitrator its
proposed determination of such matters in dispute, together with such other
information relevant to the resolution of such matters as it desires to
support its proposal. The Tax Arbitrator shall deliver to Buyer and PSC, as
promptly as practicable and in any event within thirty (30) calendar days
after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of any
such disagreement determined in accordance with this Allocation Schedule. The
Tax Arbitrator shall select as a resolution the position of either Buyer or
PSC for each item of disagreement and may not impose an alternative
resolution. The determination of the Tax Arbitrator shall be final and binding
upon Buyer and PSC. The fees and expenses of the Tax Arbitrator incurred in
connection with its review and determination of any dispute pursuant to this
Allocation Schedule shall be borne by the non-prevailing party as determined
by the Tax Arbitrator.

7.9.8 Certain Elections. Unless Buyer provides advance written consent to the
contrary, PSC shall make an election pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) only with respect to each Acquired Company listed on
Section 7.9.8 of the Disclosure Schedules for which such an election is
available to the extent necessary to cause no reduction to the tax attributes
of any Acquired Company upon disposition. Seller shall not make an election
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(B) or (C) to
reattribute any portion of the tax attributes of any Acquired Company to PSC
in an absence of Buyer's advance written consent.

  

  

7.10 Exclusivity. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, or the
earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 8, none of
the Sellers shall (and each Seller shall not cause any of its Representatives
or any Acquired Company to) solicit or initiate the submission of any proposal
or offer from any Person relating to, or enter into or consummate any
transaction relating to, the acquisition of all or substantially all of the
Equity Interests or assets of any Acquired Company (whether by merger,
recapitalization, share exchange, sale of assets or any other similar
transaction) or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding,
furnish any information with respect to, or assist or participate in any
effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek any of the foregoing.

  

  

7.11 Further Assurances. Each of the Sellers and Buyer, upon the reasonable
request of the other from time to time after the Closing, and at the expense
of the requesting party but without further consideration, shall sign such
documents and take such actions as may be necessary or otherwise reasonably
requested to make more fully effective the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions.

  

  

7.12 Right to Seller Name and Seller Marks. Buyer and its Affiliates (which,
for the purposes of this Section 7.12 shall include the Acquired Companies)
shall make no use of the Seller Name and Seller Marks in connection with
operation of the Business immediately upon the Closing. Buyer, for itself and
its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any rights in any of the Seller Name and Seller Marks
and neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall contest the ownership or
validity of any rights of the Seller or any of its Affiliates in or to any of
the Seller Name and Seller Marks. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
immediately following the Closing, but no later than three (3) Business Days
thereafter, Buyer shall cause the name of each Company and any applicable
Acquired Company to be changed in order to remove the Seller Name and Seller
Marks in the name of such Company and such Acquired Company. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each Seller acknowledges that the Seller Name and Seller Marks
may have been utilized prior to the Closing in connection with the Material
Company Contracts outstanding as of the Closing Date or any invoices, letters
or other documentation submitted prior to the Closing and those materials
shall not be deemed a breach of this Section 7.12. Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to notify vendors, suppliers and patients of
the name change in the ordinary course of business following the Closing Date.

  

  

7.13 Bonus Plan. The PHS Company has adopted the 2015 Providence Human
Services Short-Term Incentive Plan (the "Bonus Plan") pursuant to which
certain members of the Acquired Companies' management have been granted awards
of the right to earn cash bonuses. As of the Closing, Buyer shall assume such
Bonus Plan and all liabilities pursuant to such Bonus Plan and Buyer covenants
and agrees to promptly make all payments pursuant to the terms of such Bonus
Plan if and when such payments become due and payable; provided, however, that
the amount of such Bonus Plan shall be included in the Net Working Capital
Calculation.

7.14 Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.

  

  

7.14.1 During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
second (2nd) anniversary thereof (the "Restricted Period"), none of the
Sellers shall directly or indirectly invest in, own, manage, operate, finance
or control any Person engaged in any of the businesses set forth on Exhibit E
to this Agreement (the "Restricted Business") anywhere in any state within the
United States in which any of the Acquired Companies operate the Business as
of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that (a) any of the Sellers
may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, five percent (5%) or
less of the securities of any Person that is engaged in the Restricted
Business and (b) any of the Sellers may, directly or indirectly, acquire any
Person or business engaged in the Restricted Business if in the immediately
preceding twelve-month period prior to execution of definitive documentation
reflecting such acquisition, the consolidated revenues of such Person or
business from the Restricted Business constituted less than thirty-three
percent (33%) of the total revenues of such Person during such period (an
"Acquired Business"); provided, further, that following any such acquisition
and until expiration of the Restricted Period, such Seller shall not, and
shall cause an Acquired Business not to, take any actions or omit to take any
actions the intent of which is to cause an increase the annual consolidated
revenues of such Acquired Business that is derived from the Restricted
Business beyond thirty-three percent (33%) or more of the total annual
revenues of such Acquired Business for any such annual period.

  

  

7.14.2 During the Restricted Period, none of the Sellers shall directly or
indirectly solicit any employee of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing or
who is or becomes employed by the Acquired Companies during the Restricted
Period with the title of vice-president, state director, clinical director or
any title senior to any of the foregoing (the "Restricted Employee") as of the
Closing, or induce any such Restricted Employee to terminate such employment.
The foregoing restriction on solicitation shall not apply to (a) a general
solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such Restricted
Employees, (b) the solicitation or hiring of any such Restricted Employee who
has left such employment or (c) the hiring of any such Restricted Employee who
contacts any Seller on his or her own initiative without any direct or
indirect solicitation by, or inducement from, such Seller.

  

  

7.14.3 Buyer and each of the Sellers agree that the restrictions contained in
this Section 7.14, including the term of the Restricted Period and the scope
of the restrictions, are reasonable in light of the nature of the Contemplated
Transaction and the need for Buyer to protect the goodwill associated with the
Acquired Companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that if
the provisions of this Section 7.14 are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be unenforceable in any respect, it is their intention that
the restrictions set forth herein be enforced to the fullest extent permitted
by Legal Requirements, and that such court shall modify the restrictions to
the extent necessary to permit them to be enforced.

7.15 280G Approval. Prior to Closing, each Seller and each Acquired Company
shall seek shareholder approval requirements of subparagraph (B) of Section

set forth in subparagraph (ii) Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code is equaled or
exceeded in respect of either the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any event treated as contingent on the
consummation of such transactions pursuant to Question and Answer 22(b) of
Treasury Regulations Section 280G 1(b).

  

  

7.16 Performance Bonds. On or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall obtain
performance bonds on behalf of the Acquired Companies (the "Substitute
Performance Bonds"), which Substitute Performance Bonds will be effective as
of Closing, in full substitute for all performance bonds listed in Section
7.16 of the Disclosure Schedules (the "Existing Performance Bonds"), and PSC
shall obtain the release of all Acquired Companies from any and all
obligations under any of the Existing Performance Bonds and related
contractual obligations in connection therewith.

  

  

7.17 Intercompany Obligations. Each Seller shall cause all intercompany
obligations between or among the Acquired Companies or between and among such
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Companies) on the
one hand and any of the Acquired Companies on the other hand (the
"Intercompanies") to be extinguished prior to the Closing. PSC shall
reasonably inform and discuss with Buyer the actions, steps and plans
necessary or desirable to implement the foregoing (and shall provide
information reasonably necessary to Buyer to assess the consequences of such
action, step or plan) and shall consider in good faith Buyer's reasonable
comments and suggestions on such actions, steps or plans. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, PSC shall pay or cause to be paid (or, as
applicable, reimburse the applicable Acquired Company for or cause such
Acquired Company to be reimbursed for) all expenses arising out of or in
connection with the extinguishment of the Intercompanies, including without
limitation, all Taxes, legal and accounting fees incurred in connection
therewith.

  

  

7.18 Calculation of Earn-Out Amount. Following the Closing, PSC shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, provide cooperation and information as Buyer
reasonably may request in connection with the calculation and determination of
the Earn-Out Amount as defined in and pursuant to the Asset Agreement. Such
cooperation and information will include providing copies of any and all
relevant documents that are necessary or desirable to properly calculate the
Earn-Out Amount and reasonable access to employees of PSC or any of its
Affiliates who knowledgeable about the acquisition under the Asset Agreement

MGP Fredericksburg Owners B-II, LLC, as Landlord and PSC, as Tenant, as
amended by a First Amendment to Lease dated September 22, 2014, by and between
Lee II Investors, LLC and PSC (it being understood and agreed that the failure
to obtain such an estoppel certificate shall not be a condition to Closing).

7.20 Election of Directors to Maple Star Colorado Board. PSC shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each member of the board of
directors of Maple Star Colorado (other than Debi Grebenik) to resign and (ii)
the board of directors of Maple Star Colorado to appoint three (3) persons
designated in writing by Buyer to fill such vacancies (in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements and subject to any required consents or

any liability for Taxes in any period arising (directly or indirectly) as a
result of any amendment to any Pre-Closing Period Tax Return of any Acquired
Company or any Affiliated Group of which an Acquired Company was a member;

(h) up to $807,852 of Losses related to or arising from the matter described
in item 2 of Section 3.5.2 of the Disclosure Schedules.

  

  

9.2.2 Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article 9, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Seller and its respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, officers,
directors, members, partners (general and limited), managers, employees,
agents and other representatives and the Affiliates, Subsidiaries, officers,
directors, members, partners (general and limited), managers, employees,
agents and other representatives thereof as well as the successors, assigns,
heirs and personal representatives of the foregoing (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnified Persons"), from, against and in respect of any and all Losses,
actually incurred or suffered by such Seller Indemnified Persons as a result
of:

  

  

(a) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by
Buyer in this Agreement; or

  

  

(b) any breach or violation of any Pre-Closing Covenant or Post-Closing
Covenant of Buyer.

  

  

9.2.3 Source of Recovery. Subject to Section 9.2.4 and in all cases to the
other limitations and procedures contained in this Article 9, all
indemnification payment or reimbursements to any Buyer Indemnified Persons
pursuant to this Article 9 shall first be made from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
but if such Indemnity Escrow Fund is insufficient to satisfy the
indemnification obligations hereunder, any remaining amount shall be made
directly by the Sellers.

  

  

9.2.4 Limitations on Liability.

  

  

(a) Neither the Buyer Indemnified Persons nor the Seller Indemnified Persons
shall be entitled to assert any claim for indemnification under this Article 9
with respect to a single course of conduct or related set of circumstances,
occurrences or events unless the Losses arising therefrom exceed $25,000 (any
Losses in excess of such amounts being referred to herein as "Indemnifiable
Losses").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-62-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Neither the Buyer Indemnified Persons (in respect of Section 9.2.1(a)
only) nor the Seller Indemnified Persons (in respect of Section 9.2.2(a) only)
shall be entitled to assert any claim for indemnification hereunder until such
time as the aggregate amount of all Indemnifiable Losses that such Buyer
Indemnified Persons or such Seller Indemnified Persons may have under said
Section exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Basket"); and then only for the amount by
which such Indemnifiable Losses exceed the Basket; provided, that the Basket
shall not apply to (i) the Healthcare Representations (which shall be subject
to the Healthcare Basket set forth in Section 9.2.4(b) below), the Fundamental
Representations, the Reorganization Representations, the Tax Representations
or the Real Estate Representations or (ii) any fraud or intentional
misrepresentation.

  

  

(c) The Buyer Indemnified Persons (in respect of the Healthcare
Representations only) shall not be entitled to assert any claim for
indemnification hereunder until such time as the aggregate amount of all
Indemnifiable Losses that such Buyer Indemnified Persons may have under the
Healthcare Representations exceeds $2,000,000 (the "Healthcare Basket") (it
being understood and agreed that applicable amounts included in the $1,000,000
Basket described in Section 9.2.4(b) shall count towards the satisfaction of
the Healthcare Basket), and then only for the amount by which such
Indemnifiable Losses exceed the Healthcare Basket.

  

  

(d) Subject to this Article 9 and only in respect of Indemnifiable Losses in
excess of the Basket, the aggregate liability for indemnification claims under
Section 9.2.1(a) shall be limited to an amount equal to $16,000,000 (as such
amount may be reduced in accordance with this Section 9.2.4(d)) (the "Cap"),
and shall be paid solely in accordance with Section 9.2.3; provided, that such
limitation shall not apply to (i) any Losses arising from breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any of the Fundamental Representations, the Reorganization
Representations, the Tax Representations, the Real Estate Representations or
the Healthcare Representations or (ii) any fraud or intentional
misrepresentation; provided, further, that if there are Indemnifiable Losses
related to the Healthcare Representations (the "Indemnifiable Healthcare
Losses"), the aggregate liability for indemnification claims under Section
9.2.1(a) (excluding liabilities arising from or relating to the Reorganization
Representations, the Tax Representations, the Real Estate Representations and
Fundamental Representations) shall be limited to an amount equal to the Cap
less the amount of such Indemnifiable Healthcare Losses, as determined from
time to time and subject to Section 9.2.4(e). The aggregate liability for
indemnification claims under Section 9.2.2(a) shall be limited to the Cap and
shall be paid directly by Buyer to the applicable Seller Indemnified Person
with respect to such Loss. The liability limitation set forth herein shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 9.2.6.

  

  

(e) Subject to this Article 9 and only with respect to Indemnifiable Losses in
excess of the Healthcare Basket, the aggregate liability for indemnification
claims under Section 9.2.1(a) with respect to Healthcare Representations shall
be limited as follows (and shall be paid in the following order of priority
and solely in accordance with Section 9.2.3): (i) with respect to up to the
first $20 million of such Indemnifiable Healthcare Losses, the Sellers shall
be liable for one hundred percent (100%) of such amounts less the aggregate
amount of any other Indemnifiable Losses recovered from Sellers by any Buyer
Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 9.2.1(a) ("Recovered Losses"), (ii)
with respect to that portion of such Indemnifiable Healthcare Losses that
exceed $20 million and are equal to or less than $50 million, the aggregate
liability for indemnification claims under Section 9.2.1(a) in respect of
Healthcare Representations shall be limited to an amount equal one-third (1/3)
of such amounts, and (iii) with respect to that portion of such Indemnifiable
Healthcare Losses that exceed $50 million and are equal to or less than $80
million, the aggregate liability for indemnification claims under Section
9.2.1(a) in respect of Healthcare Representations shall be limited to an
amount equal two-thirds (2/3) of such amounts. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Sellers' aggregate liability for indemnification claims under Section 9.2.1(a)
in respect of Healthcare Representations shall in no event exceed $50 million
less the aggregate amount of any Recovered Losses.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-63-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) The aggregate liability for indemnification claims under this Article 9
shall be limited to the Base Purchase Price; provided, however, in the case of
fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the applicable Indemnifying Party's
liability shall not be limited to the Base Purchase Price.

  

  

(g) The amount of Losses for which indemnification is available under this
Article 9 shall be calculated net of any amounts actually recovered by an
Indemnified Person under insurance policies or otherwise from third parties
with respect to such Losses. In addition, the amount of Losses for which
indemnification is available under this Article 9 shall be in the case of
claims under Section 9.2.1, calculated net of all amounts reflected in the Net
Working Capital.

  

  

(h) Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Person for any indemnification
claim pursuant to this Article 9, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated,
to the extent of such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified Person may
have against any third parties with respect to the subject matter underlying
such indemnification claim and the Indemnified Person shall assign any such
rights to the Indemnifying Party, provided that such subrogation could not
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the business, affairs,
customer or supplier relationships or prospects of the business of the
Acquired Companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnifying Party's
right to seek coverage from any subrogation with respect to insurance carriers
shall not be subject to the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence.

  

  

(i) Each Indemnified Person shall, to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements, use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
any Losses; provided that any Loss incurred by an Indemnified Person in
connection with the use of its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
Losses pursuant to this Section 9.2.4(i) shall constitute Losses incurred by
such Indemnified Person for which such Indemnified Person shall be indemnified
pursuant to this Article 9.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-64-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(j) No party shall have any liability to any other party to this Agreement
(including under this Article 9) for any Losses that constitute special,
exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, except to the extent that any
such Losses (i) that constitute special, exemplary or punitive damages result
from an award of damages in a Third Party Claim and/or (ii) that constitute
consequential damages were probable or reasonably foreseeable and are a direct
result of the related breach or alleged breach of this Agreement.

  

  

9.2.5 Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) Notice of Claim. If any third party (i.e., any Person who is not a party
to this Agreement or an Affiliate thereof) notifies an Indemnified Person with
respect to any matter (a "Third Party Claim") which may give rise to a claim
for indemnification hereunder against an Indemnifying Party, then such
Indemnified Person will promptly (and, in any event, within thirty (30)
calendar days) give written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party, said
notice to describe in reasonable detail all facts and circumstances then known
or reasonably available to such Indemnified Person with respect to such Third
Party Claim and the claimed items and amounts of Losses with respect thereto,
as well as all provisions of this Agreement that are the bases for the
indemnification claim with respect to such Third Party Claim; provided,
however, that, subject to Section 9.1, no delay on the part of the Indemnified
Person in notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party
from any obligation under this Article 9, except to the extent such delay
actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

(b) Assumption of Defense. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim that is the subject of a
notice given by the Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 9.2.5(a). In
addition, upon written notice to the Indemnified Person, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Person against the Third
Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Person so long as the Indemnifying Party acknowledges its
liability for such indemnification hereunder (which liability for
indemnification shall thereby be conclusively established) and shall keep the
Indemnified Person reasonably informed with respect to the Third Party Claim.
In such event, the Indemnified Person may retain separate co-counsel at its
sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim
(though not of record, and shall not communicate with the Person asserting the
Third Party Claim, or such Person's Representatives, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party); provided, that if the Indemnified Person
shall have reasonably concluded that separate counsel is required because a
conflict of interest would otherwise exist or because of the Indemnifying
Party's failure to defend for a period of sixty (60) calendar days any claim
after receiving notice from the Indemnified Person of such alleged failure to
defend, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to select separate counsel
of its own choosing to participate in the defense, settlement, adjustment or
compromise of such action on its behalf, and the reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) of defending such Third Party Claim
shall be included as Losses. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing, if
(i) a Third Party Claim seeks relief other than the payment of monetary
damages, or (ii) a Third Party Claim is or relates directly to any criminal
Action, then, in each case, the Indemnified Person alone shall be entitled to
contest, defend and settle such Third Party Claim ((i) and (ii) together, the
"Excepted Procedural Matters"). The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with
respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Person (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) unless such judgment, compromise or settlement (i) provides for
the payment of money as sole relief for the claimant, and (ii) subject to the
making of such payment, results in the full and general release of such
Indemnified Person from all liabilities arising from or relating to the Third
Party Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts paid or to be paid by an
Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense, settlement or other
resolution of any Third Party Claims shall be deemed to be Losses for purposes
of the monetary limitations set forth in Section 9.2.4(b) and shall, in the
case of any indemnification claim under Section 9.2.1, be paid solely in
accordance with Section 9.2.3.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-65-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Indemnified Person's Control. If the Indemnifying Party does not deliver
the notice contemplated by Section 9.2.5(b) within thirty (30) days after the
Indemnified Person has given notice of the Third Party Claim pursuant to
Section 9.2.5(a) or is unable to assume control of the deference for which the
Indemnified Person would be entitled to an indemnification hereunder, (i) the
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to have the control over the defense and
settlement of the subject matter, (ii) the Indemnifying Party will reasonably
cooperate with and make available to the Indemnified Person such assistance
and materials as it may reasonably request, and (iii) except for the Excepted
Procedural Matters, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right (at its
expense) to participate in the defense assist by counsel of its own choosing.
If the Indemnified Party defends any Third Party Claim, then (A) the
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of
defending such Third Party Claim shall be included as Losses, (B) the
Indemnified Person shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed with
respect to the Third Party Claim and (C) the Indemnified Person shall obtain
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into a
settlement, adjustment or compromise of such Third Party Claim; provided, that
if the Indemnified Person elects to enter into a settlement, adjustment or
compromise, the Indemnifying Party will not be bound to indemnify the
Indemnified Person unless it is otherwise determined to be a proper
indemnification claim hereunder.

  

  

(d) Other Claims. In the event that any party to this Agreement proposes to
make any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article 9 and such claim
does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person making the claim
shall deliver on or prior to the date upon which the applicable
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements expire pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, in addition to an indemnification claim notice, a
certificate signed by the Indemnified Person or an officer of the Indemnified
Person (the "Claim Certificate") to the Indemnifying Party, which Claim
Certificate shall (i) describe in reasonable detail all relevant facts giving
rise or relating to the claim; (ii) specify the Section or Sections of this
Agreement under which such claim is made; and (iii) specify in reasonable
detail each individual item of Loss, including the amount thereof if
reasonably ascertainable, the date such Losses were incurred, properly accrued
or are anticipated to be incurred and the misrepresentation or breach to which
such Losses are related. Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure to provide all
of the information required to be in the Claim Certificate shall not bar an
indemnification claim. In the event a Claim Certificate is delivered, the
Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Person as to whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes the claim for indemnification contained therein
within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Claim Certificate. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day
period, such claim specified in the Claim Certificate shall be conclusively
deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and the amount specified in the
Claim Certificate, if any, shall be payable by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Person within five (5) Business Days upon the Indemnified Person's
notice to the Indemnifying Party or, in the case of any notice in which the
amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, within five (5)
Business Days of such later date when the amount of such claim (or such
portion thereof) becomes finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party does
provide a dispute notice within the thirty (30) day period, no payments shall
be made as to such indemnification claims until final resolution is reached
either by mutual written agreement between the parties or a final, binding and
non-appealable decision by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance
with Sections 10.8 and 10.9.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-66-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

9.2.6 Remedies Exclusive. The parties covenant and agree that from and after
the Closing the remedies provided for in this Article 9 shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy for all Losses that any Indemnified Person may
suffer or incur arising from, or directly or indirectly relating to, the
Acquired Companies, this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, and the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive any other rights or remedies (whether
at law or in equity and whether based on contract, tort, statute or otherwise)
that they may otherwise have had, now have or may in the future have against
any of the other parties hereto or any of the respective direct or indirect
Affiliates, officers, managers, directors, employees, advisors, membership
interest holders, stockholders, members, consultants, investment bankers,
brokers, controlling persons, partners, managers or other representatives or
agents thereof (each of whom shall be an express third party beneficiary
hereof) arising from, or directly or indirectly relating to, the Acquired
Companies, this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions and covenant not to
sue or otherwise assert any claim (or assist any other Person in suing or
otherwise asserting any claim) encompassed by the foregoing covenant,
agreement and waiver; provided, however, that, except with respect the
Sellers' right to remedies under Section 8.3 and; provided, further, that
subject to Section 9.3, the foregoing shall not apply to claims of common law
fraud or intentional misrepresentation based on the representations and
warranties set forth in Articles 3 and 4, as applicable, and provided,
further, that the foregoing shall not apply to the parties' rights to seek
specific performance as contemplated by Section 10.12 or a breach of contract
action with respect to covenants to be performed after the Closing pursuant to
this Agreement. Any Person who is sued or otherwise has a claim asserted
against him, her or it in violation of this Section 9.2.6 may enforce the
terms of this Section 9.2.6 directly as an express third-party beneficiary
hereof.

  

  

9.2.7 Tax Claims. The provisions of Section 9.2.5 shall not apply with respect
to any audit or examination of any Tax Return or any proposed change or
adjustment, claim, dispute, arbitration, litigation or other proceeding
involving a Taxing Authority or with respect to Taxes. The provisions of
Section 7.9.6 shall govern matters relating to notice, control and settlement
of Tax Claims.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-67-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

9.2.8 Tax Treatment. The parties will treat any payment received pursuant to
this Article 9 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax and financial
reporting purposes to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements.

  

  

9.2.9 Additional Indemnity Provisions. The indemnification rights of the
parties hereunder shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for the sole
purpose of determining the amount of any Losses that are the subject matter of
a claim for indemnification hereunder (but not for purposes of determining any
breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty for any purpose
hereunder), each representation and warranty and other provision contained in
this Agreement shall be read without regard and without giving effect to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect standard or qualification contained in
such representation or warranty (as if such standard or qualification was
deleted from such representation and warranty).

  

  

(b) Each Seller acknowledges that any Buyer Indemnified Person's rights to
indemnification for representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of
such Seller contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and the
rights and remedies that may be exercised by any such Buyer Indemnified
Person, are part of the basis of the bargain contemplated by this Agreement,
and Buyer's rights to indemnification under this Agreement shall not be
limited, waived or otherwise affected by virtue of (and Buyer shall be deemed
to have relied on the express representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement notwithstanding) any knowledge on the part of Buyer or any of its
Representatives, of any inaccuracy of any such representation or warranty of
such Seller set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, regardless
of whether such knowledge was obtained through Buyer's own investigation or
otherwise (including disclosure by such Seller, the Acquired Companies or any
of their respective Representatives), and regardless of whether such knowledge
was obtained before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

  

  

9.3 Acknowledgment. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that none of the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives has made or
shall be deemed to have made, and Buyer has not relied on, any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, express or implied, with respect to the
Acquired Companies, the Interests, the assets, the liabilities of the Acquired
Companies, the Business, the Contemplated Transactions and any other rights or
obligations to be transferred, directly or indirectly, pursuant to this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, or the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the Acquired Companies, the Interests, the assets, the
liabilities of the Acquired Companies, the Business, the Contemplated
Transactions and any other rights or obligations to be transferred, directly
or indirectly, pursuant to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
furnished or made available to Buyer and its Representatives, other than the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of each
Seller that are expressly set forth in this Agreement or in Ancillary
Agreements.

each of the parties hereto will assume and bear all expenses, costs and fees
(including legal and accounting fees and expenses) incurred by such party in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions.

  

  

10.3 Entire Agreement. The agreement of the parties that is comprised of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements sets forth the entire agreement and
understanding among the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof and
supersedes any and all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and

unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. In the event that any provision hereof
would, under applicable Legal Requirements, be invalid or unenforceable in any
respect, each party hereto intends that such provision will be construed by

10.7 Assignment. This Agreement and any rights and obligations hereunder may
not be assigned, hypothecated or otherwise transferred by any party hereto (by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written agreement of Buyer
and PSC; provided, that an assignment to an Affiliate of Buyer shall only
require notice to the Sellers and any such assignment shall not relieve Buyer
of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment, hypothecation or
transfer in breach of this Section 10.7 shall be null and void ab initio.

  

  

10.8 Governing Law. This Agreement, the rights of the parties hereunder, and
all claims arising in whole or in part out of, related to, based upon, or in
connection herewith or the subject matter hereof or the Contemplated
Transactions (whether sounding in contract, tort, statute or otherwise) will
be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws of any other
jurisdiction.

  

  

10.9 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each party to this Agreement, by its execution
hereof, hereby (a) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if but only if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware)
for the purpose of any and all actions, suits or proceedings arising in whole
or in part out of, related to, based upon or in connection with this Agreement
or the subject matter hereof or the Contemplated Transactions (whether
sounding in contract, tort, statute or otherwise), (b) waives to the extent
not prohibited by applicable law, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion,
as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding any claim
that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in one of the above-named
courts should be dismissed on grounds of improper venue or forum non
conveniens, should be transferred or removed to any court other than one of
the above-named courts, or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some
other action, suit or proceeding in any other court other than one of the
above-named courts, or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may
not be enforced in or by such court and (c) agrees not to commence or
prosecute any such action, suit or proceeding other than before one of the
above-named courts nor to make any motion or take any other action seeking or
intending to cause the transfer or removal of any such action, suit or
proceeding to any court other than one of the above-named courts whether on
the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, inconvenient
forum or otherwise. Each party hereby irrevocably (i) consents to service of
process in any such action, suit or proceeding in any manner permitted by the
laws of the State of Delaware; (ii) agrees that service of process made in
accordance with clause (i) or made by personal delivery or nationally
