From the Effective Time until the second anniversary thereof (the "Benefits Continuation Period"), except as expressly provided herein, the Surviving Corporation shall provide compensation and Benefits Plans to the current employees of Company and its Subsidiaries that are in the aggregate no less favorable than those provided to the current employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date.  </LI>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><U>Pre-Existing Limitations; Service Credit</U>.  With respect to any Benefit Plans in which any Company employees first become eligible to participate, on or after the Effective Time, and which are plans that the Company employees did not participate in prior to the Effective Time (the "<U>New Company Plans</U>"), Purchaser shall: (A)&nbsp;waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company employees under any health and welfare New Company Plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, and deductibles, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the Company employees during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs shall reduce the amount of deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket payments under the New Company Plans for such calendar year; provided that such Company employee and covered family members were enrolled in comparable coverage under the Benefit Plans of Company on the Effective Time and continuously thereafter until the effective time of coverage in the New Company Plans, and (B)&nbsp;recognize service of the Company employees with the Company (or otherwise credited by the Company) accrued prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit (and levels of benefits) in any New Company Plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, to the extent service is taken into account under the applicable New Company Plan; provided, however, in no event shall any credit be given to the extent it would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service.  </LI>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><U>Parachute Payments</U>.  Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain shareholder approval for each payment or benefit which would be a payment described in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code to or for the benefit of any person who would be treated as a
  "disqualified individual" under Section 280G(c) of the Code in a manner sufficient to satisfy Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code, so that no such payment or benefit will be treated as a payment described in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code after such approval.</LI>

In addition, Mr. Lail's written agreement provides that his change in control agreement shall terminate as of the Effective Time. The cash payment rights waived and the amount to be paid (subject to applicable withholding requirements) to each of those employees as of the Closing Date in exchange for such waiver are described in Schedule&nbsp;5.5(g).</LI>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Severance</U>.  The Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each Severance Eligible Employee a Severance Benefit.  For purposes of this section, a "<U>Severance Eligible Employee</U>" is a Company employee (other than those employees covered by Change in Control Agreements) who, on the Closing Date or within one year thereafter (i) is terminated for reasons other than for cause by the Surviving Corporation, or (ii) voluntarily terminates employment with the Surviving Corporation after (A) the employee is notified that his or her place of employment is to be relocated to a location further than twenty-five miles from the employee's work location as of the Closing Date, or (B) the employee's compensation level (which shall mean the employee's base salary or base wages plus the employee's current bonus opportunity) is reduced by 10% or more from the employee's compensation level as of the Closing Date.  A "<U>Severance Benefit</U> means a lump sum payment to such Severance Eligible Employee in an amount equal to the sum of (i) any amounts due and payable including the current year Prorated Bonus (as defined below) and the due and accrued personal days and vacation due to such employee, plus (ii) the product of the employee's years of service with the Company and Surviving Corporation (subject to a minimum of 2 years of service and a maximum of 12 years of service) multiplied by the employee's Average Weekly Pay.  The employee's "<U>Average Weekly Pay</U>" shall equal the quotient of (i) the sum of the employee's (A) annual base salary or annual base wage (as determined immediately prior to the employee's termination date or the Closing Date, whichever results in a larger amount), plus (B) the employee's Prorated Bonus, divided by (ii) 52 weeks.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, each employee's "<U>Prorated Bonus</U>" shall be calculated as follows: (i) if the respective employee's termination date is less than three months into the Surviving Corporation's fiscal year, the Prorated Bonus equals zero, (ii) if the respective employee's termination date is at least three months but less than six months into the Surviving Corporation's fiscal year, the Prorated Bonus equals the employee's targeted bonus, prorated for the actual number of months employed during the Surviving Corporation's fiscal year, and (iii) if the respective employee's termination date is at least six months into the Surviving Corporation's fiscal year, the Prorated Bonus equals the employee's actual or targeted bonus, whichever is greater, prorated for the actual number of months employed during the Surviving Corporation's fiscal year.  For bonuses that are earned and paid on a monthly basis, the payment shall be average of the bonuses paid in the last six months.  Each Severance Eligible Employee who is terminated shall be provided a written notice of the employee's termination ("<U>Termination Notice</U>") and a Severance Eligible Employee who has received a Termination Notice will not receive the Severance Benefit unless the employee works until his scheduled termination date; provided however that the Surviving Corporation may waive this requirement.  In the event a person's compensation has been reduced and the employee chooses to continue to work, the employee would be eligible for a partial severance payment calculated as it would have been but multiplied by the percentage of the salary reduction.</LI>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Company Stock Option Plan and Agreements</U>.&nbsp;  The Company and each employee who is a party to a stock option agreement with the Company as set forth on Schedule 3.1(b)(ii) have entered into a binding written agreement with the Company
to terminate each such stock option agreement effective as of the Closing Date.  Each such agreement
specifically provides that all options under the Company Stock Option Plan and the stock option agreements shall be cancelled in exchange for the payment<A NAME="_DV_C145"> described in Section&nbsp;2.4 of this Agreement, if applicable, and if  not, in consideration of future employment with the Surviving Corporation, and contains </A>a provision whereby the employee acknowledges and agrees that the Surviving Corporation's failure to continue the Company Stock Option Plan and the stock option agreements, or to provide a substantially comparable benefit thereto, will not be considered "Good Reason" under the Change in Control Agreement between the Company and such employee.</LI>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>WARN Act</U>.  The Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates to timely perform and discharge all requirements under the WARN Act and under applicable state and local laws and regulations for the notification of its employees arising from the termination of any employees as a result of the Merger or the closing of any stores.</LI>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Employee Discounts</U>.  All eligible former Company employees as well as current Company employees who retire or are terminated will continue to be eligible to receive discounts pursuant to the Company's Employee Discount Policy in effect as of the date hereof through December 31, 2003.  Thereafter, the discount policy as it applies to employees and former employees as well as the conditions for eligibility may be changed in accordance with the Surviving Corporation's Employee Discount Policy.</LI>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Community Pledges</U>.  After the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation will continue to make contributions and pledges, both verbal and by voucher, in the amounts and to the organizations set forth on Schedule&nbsp;5.5(m).<A NAME="_DV_C147"></LI>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Merger Completion Bonuses</U>.  The Company shall pay merger completion bonuses in an aggregate amount of no more than $5,000,000 (the "<U>Merger Completion Bonuses</U>") (subject to applicable withholding requirements) on the Closing Date to certain designated employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
