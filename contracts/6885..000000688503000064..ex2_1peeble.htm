 **ARTICLE II** 
 MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF SHARES 
 AND EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

 **  2.1 **_Merger Consideration; Repayment Or Refinancing Of Debt; Employee Payments_.

 

       _

 1. Merger Consideration_. The aggregate consideration to be paid in immediately available funds at Closing by the Parent or the Purchaser to the Paying Agent (as defined below) for the benefit of the holders of the Company Common Stock (as defined in Section 8.12) in this transaction shall be as set forth in Section 2.2(b)(the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
  _

 2. Payment on Vested Stock Options_. In addition to the Merger Consideration, the Parent or Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make the payments to holders of Vested Stock Options described in Section 2.4, subject to applicable withholding requirements.
  _

 3. Repayment or Refinancing of Debt_. In addition to the Merger Consideration, the Parent shall repay or refinance any debt related to the Company and its Subsidiaries\' existing working capital facility with Fleet Retail Finance Inc., as agent for certain lenders (the " _Fleet Debt_ ").
  _

 4. Employee Payments_. In addition to the Merger Consideration and the Parent\'s obligation to repay or refinance the Fleet Debt, the Parent or the Purchaser shall cause or allow to be paid in immediately available funds at Closing those payments to existing employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as set forth in Schedules 5.5(e), 5.5(g) and 5.5(n) of this Agreement subject to applicable withholding requirements.
    

  

 **2.2**   _Effect on Company Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock.

 

      

 1. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock (the " _Company Treasury Shares_ ") shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefore.
 

 2. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Company Treasury Shares and Dissenting Shares as defined in Section 2.3 hereof) shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Equity Value Per Share. As used herein, "Equity Value Per Share" shall be equal to (A) $161,000,000 increased by the proceeds from the deemed exercise of Vested Stock Options (as defined in Section 2.4), minus (B) Specified Company Expenses (as defined in Section 8.12); divided by the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company Treasury Shares) as increased by giving effect to all Vested Stock Options (as defined in Section 2.4), in a manner consistent with the calculation set forth on Schedule 2.2(b). Upon such conversion, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each Company Certificate (as defined in Section 2.6) shall thereafter represent the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration upon the surrender of the Company Certificate in accordance with the terms hereof.  Schedule 2.2(b) sets forth an example of the calculation of the Equity Value Per Share.
 

 3. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of the Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $.01, of the Surviving Corporation.
    

  

 **2.3**   _Dissenting Shares_. The Company shall comply with all applicable requirements under the GCL with respect to shareholder appraisal rights arising with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock which are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has delivered a written demand for appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the GCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as provided in Section 2.2 hereof, unless and until such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal and payment under Section 262 of the GCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses his right to appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled, without interest thereon. The Company shall give the Purchaser (i) prompt notice of any notice or demands for appraisal or payment for shares received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices.

 

 **2.4**   _Vested Stock Options_. Each holder of an in the money vested option (or an in the money option that will become vested as a result of the Merger) to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Vested Stock Options_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company\'s Stock Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock Option Plan_ ") will receive from the Surviving Corporation, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash (subject to applicable withholding requirements) equal to the difference between the Equity Value Per Share and the exercise price that would have been payable under such option to acquire such share, by virtue of the Merger, and all vested and non-vested options granted under the Company Stock Option Plan shall be cancelled. Schedule 3.1(b)(ii), which the Company agrees to update as of the Closing Date, accurately and completely reflects, on an employee by employee basis, the names, addresses, date of grant, exercise price and number of Vested Stock Options held by employees of the Company and the payments to which they are entitled under this Section 2.4.Schedule 2.2(b) sets forth an example of the calculation of Equity Value Per Share.

  **2.5**   _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Company Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or different class
by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up,
combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in
any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period,
or any similar event shall have occurred, the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

 **  2.6 **_Paying Agent; Paying Agent Agreement; Paying Agent Schedule_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Purchaser shall appoint a paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ")for the purpose of exchanging certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of the Company Common Stock (the " _Company Certificates_ ") for the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with instructions prepared by the Company and the Purchaser. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company, the Purchaser and the Paying Agent shall enter into a written agreement (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ") which shall govern the disbursement of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.6. The Paying Agent Agreement shall be in a form substantially similar in form to that attached as Exhibit E to this Agreement. All fees and expenses of the Paying Agent shall be paid by the Purchaser. At or prior to the execution of the Paying Agent Agreement by the Purchaser, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser and to the Paying Agent a complete and correct schedule (the " _Paying Agent Schedule_ ") to be attached to the Paying Agent Agreement containing (a) the name and address of each holder of Company Common Stock, (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by each holder, (c) the number of the Company Certificate to be exchanged for the Merger Consideration, (d) the Merger Consideration to be paid by the Paying Agent to each holder of Company Common Stock, and (e) such other information as the Paying Agent may reasonably require. 

 **  2.7 **_Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
the Parent or the Purchaser shall deposit with the Paying Agent, in trust for
the benefit of holders of shares of the Company Common Stock cash sufficient
to pay the Merger Consideration. Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent
shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." 

 **  2.8 **_Exchange Procedures_. Within two (2) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of a Company Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Purchaser may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Company Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore the Merger Consideration applicable to such holder. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration.  

 **  2.9 **_No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common
Stock_. All cash paid upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of Article I and this Article II shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Article II,
each Company Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration. 

 **  2.10 **_Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company
Certificates twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Purchaser or otherwise on the instruction of the Purchaser and any holders of
the Company Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article
II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and the Purchaser
for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant
to Section 2.2 and Section 2.8. 

 **  2.11 **_No Liability_. None of Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub, Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.  

 **  2.12 **_Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Purchaser on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to the Purchaser. 

 **  2.13 **_Lost Certificates_. If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement. 

 **  2.14 **_Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving
Corporation, the Purchaser, the Parent and the Paying Agent, as the case may
be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, the Purchaser or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation, the Purchaser or the Paying Agent, as the case may
be, and such amounts shall be delivered by the Surviving Corporation, the
Purchaser or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, to the applicable taxing
authority. 

 **  2.15 **_Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or the Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or the Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. 

 **2.16**   _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. On or after the Effective Time, any Company Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or the Purchaser for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

commercially reasonable efforts to get any such restriction waived). The
Parent will hold any such information which is non-public in confidence to the
extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement between the Company and the Parent dated as of March
24, 2003 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Any investigation by the

of the Company or the Purchaser, as the case may be.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each of Parent and Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry under the HSR Act. The Parent shall pay the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice, as the case may be, the HSR filing fee (the " _HSR Fee_ "). 
    

   **  5.4 **_No Solicitation of Transactions_. The Company
agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, it shall not, and shall not
authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or its

or facilitate, or furnish or disclose non-public information in furtherance
of, any inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to any
Alternative Transaction (as defined in Section 8.12), or negotiate, explore or
otherwise engage in discussions with any Person (other than the Parent,
Purchaser, Merger Sub or their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents and representatives) with respect to any Alternative Transaction or
enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

 **  5.5 **_Employee Benefit Matters_. 

      

 1. _Continuation and Comparability of Benefits_. From the Effective Time until the second anniversary thereof (the "Benefits Continuation Period"), except as expressly provided herein, the Surviving Corporation shall provide compensation and Benefits Plans to the current employees of Company and its Subsidiaries that are in the aggregate no less favorable than those provided to the current employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date. 
 

 2. _Pre-Existing Limitations; Service Credit_. With respect to any Benefit Plans in which any Company employees first become eligible to participate, on or after the Effective Time, and which are plans that the Company employees did not participate in prior to the Effective Time (the " _New Company Plans_ "), Purchaser shall: (A) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company employees under any health and welfare New Company Plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, and deductibles, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the Company employees during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs shall reduce the amount of deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket payments under the New Company Plans for such calendar year; provided that such Company employee and covered family members were enrolled in comparable coverage under the Benefit Plans of Company on the Effective Time and continuously thereafter until the effective time of coverage in the New Company Plans, and (B) recognize service of the Company employees with the Company (or otherwise credited by the Company) accrued prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit (and levels of benefits) in any New Company Plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, to the extent service is taken into account under the applicable New Company Plan; provided, however, in no event shall any credit be given to the extent it would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service. 
 

 3. _Parachute Payments_. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain shareholder approval for each payment or benefit which would be a payment described in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code to or for the benefit of any person who would be treated as a  "disqualified individual" under Section 280G(c) of the Code in a manner sufficient to satisfy Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code, so that no such payment or benefit will be treated as a payment described in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code after such approval.
 

 4. _COBRA_. The Parent and the other members of its Controlled Group shall be responsible for providing group health plan coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA coverage") for each person who is entitled to receive COBRA coverage with respect to a Company Plan as a result of a "qualifying event" (within the meaning of Section 4980B(f)(3)) that occurs before, on or after the Closing Date.
 

 5. _Executive Employee Supplemental Retirement Plan and Benefit Restoration Plan_. The Company has caused the Company\'s Executive Employee Supplemental Retirement Plan and Benefit Restoration Plan (collectively, the " _Supplemental Retirement Plans_ ") to be amended to provide for a lump sum payment to each participant on the Closing Date of the full accrued benefit (subject to applicable withholding requirements) that would be payable to the participant pursuant to the terms of the Supplemental Retirement Plans upon termination of each participant\'s employment with the Company after a change in control of the Company. The Company represents and warrants that Schedule 5.5(e) completely and accurately identifies each participant to the Supplemental Retirement Plans and reasonably estimates the lump sum payment to which each participant is entitled to be paid on the Closing Date. The Company and each participant identified on Schedule 5.5(e) have entered into a binding written agreement to terminate each such Supplemental Retirement Plan effective as of the Closing Date and containing appropriate release language in return for the lump sum payments set forth above.
  _

 6. Split Dollar Life Insurance Plan and Agreements_. The Company and each employee identified on Schedule 5.5(f) who is a party to a split dollar life insurance agreement with the Company as identified on Schedule 5.5(f) have entered into a binding written agreement to terminate each such split dollar life insurance agreement effective as of the Closing Date. Each such agreement contains a provision whereby the employee acknowledges and agrees that the Surviving Corporation\'s failure to continue the Company\'s split dollar life insurance plan and the split dollar life insurance agreements, or to provide a substantially comparable benefit thereto, will not be considered "Good Reason" under the Change in Control Agreement between the Company and such employee.
  _

 7. Existing Change in Control Agreements_. Michael F. Moorman and E. Randolph Lail each have entered into binding written agreements with the Company waiving their rights effective as of the Closing Date to receive certain cash payments (subject to applicable withholding requirements) that would be payable to each of those employees pursuant to his change in control agreement with the Company after a change in control of the Company in exchange for a lump sum cash payment by the Company to those employees as of the Closing Date. In addition, Mr. Lail\'s written agreement provides that his change in control agreement shall terminate as of the Effective Time. The cash payment rights waived and the amount to be paid (subject to applicable withholding requirements) to each of those employees as of the Closing Date in exchange for such waiver are described in Schedule 5.5(g).
  _

 8. Employment Agreements; Change in Control Agreements_. The employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 5.5(h)(i) (Executives with "2X" Change in Control Agreements) have signed and delivered an employment agreement with the Parent, as employer, dated as of the date of the Agreement and effective as of the Effective Time, (the "Employment Agreement"), and have entered into binding written agreements with the Company to terminate their change in control agreements effective as of the Effective Time. The Employment Agreements shall supercede any change in control agreements which may be in effect. The Surviving Corporation or the Parent shall assume the existing Change in Control Agreements for the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 5.5(h)(ii) (Executives with "1X" Change in Control Agreements) which shall remain in full force and effect according to their terms. 
  _

 9. Severance_. The Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each Severance Eligible Employee a Severance Benefit. For purposes of this section, a " _Severance Eligible Employee_ " is a Company employee (other than those employees covered by Change in Control Agreements) who, on the Closing Date or within one year thereafter (i) is terminated for reasons other than for cause by the Surviving Corporation, or (ii) voluntarily terminates employment with the Surviving Corporation after (A) the employee is notified that his or her place of employment is to be relocated to a location further than twenty-five miles from the employee\'s work location as of the Closing Date, or (B) the employee\'s compensation level (which shall mean the employee\'s base salary or base wages plus the employee\'s current bonus opportunity) is reduced by 10% or more from the employee\'s compensation level as of the Closing Date. A " _Severance Benefit_ means a lump sum payment to such Severance Eligible Employee in an amount equal to the sum of (i) any amounts due and payable including the current year Prorated Bonus (as defined below) and the due and accrued personal days and vacation due to such employee, plus (ii) the product of the employee\'s years of service with the Company and Surviving Corporation (subject to a minimum of 2 years of service and a maximum of 12 years of service) multiplied by the employee\'s Average Weekly Pay. The employee\'s " _Average Weekly Pay_ " shall equal the quotient of (i) the sum of the employee\'s (A) annual base salary or annual base wage (as determined immediately prior to the employee\'s termination date or the Closing Date, whichever results in a larger amount), plus (B) the employee\'s Prorated Bonus, divided by (ii) 52 weeks. For purposes of the preceding sentence, each employee\'s " _Prorated Bonus_ " shall be calculated as follows: (i) if the respective employee\'s termination date is less than three months into the Surviving Corporation\'s fiscal year, the Prorated Bonus equals zero, (ii) if the respective employee\'s termination date is at least three months but less than six months into the Surviving Corporation\'s fiscal year, the Prorated Bonus equals the employee\'s targeted bonus, prorated for the actual number of months employed during the Surviving Corporation\'s fiscal year, and (iii) if the respective employee\'s termination date is at least six months into the Surviving Corporation\'s fiscal year, the Prorated Bonus equals the employee\'s actual or targeted bonus, whichever is greater, prorated for the actual number of months employed during the Surviving Corporation\'s fiscal year. For bonuses that are earned and paid on a monthly basis, the payment shall be average of the bonuses paid in the last six months. Each Severance Eligible Employee who is terminated shall be provided a written notice of the employee\'s termination (" _Termination Notice_ ") and a Severance Eligible Employee who has received a Termination Notice will not receive the Severance Benefit unless the employee works until his scheduled termination date; provided however that the Surviving Corporation may waive this requirement. In the event a person\'s compensation has been reduced and the employee chooses to continue to work, the employee would be eligible for a partial severance payment calculated as it would have been but multiplied by the percentage of the salary reduction.
  _

 10. Company Stock Option Plan and Agreements_. The Company and each employee who is a party to a stock option agreement with the Company as set forth on Schedule 3.1(b)(ii) have entered into a binding written agreement with the Company to terminate each such stock option agreement effective as of the Closing Date. Each such agreement specifically provides that all options under the Company Stock Option Plan and the stock option agreements shall be cancelled in exchange for the payment described in Section 2.4 of this Agreement, if applicable, and if not, in consideration of future employment with the Surviving Corporation, and contains a provision whereby the employee acknowledges and agrees that the Surviving Corporation\'s failure to continue the Company Stock Option Plan and the stock option agreements, or to provide a substantially comparable benefit thereto, will not be considered "Good Reason" under the Change in Control Agreement between the Company and such employee.
  _

 11. WARN Act_. The Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates to timely perform and discharge all requirements under the WARN Act and under applicable state and local laws and regulations for the notification of its employees arising from the termination of any employees as a result of the Merger or the closing of any stores.
  _

 12. Employee Discounts_. All eligible former Company employees as well as current Company employees who retire or are terminated will continue to be eligible to receive discounts pursuant to the Company\'s Employee Discount Policy in effect as of the date hereof through December 31, 2003. Thereafter, the discount policy as it applies to employees and former employees as well as the conditions for eligibility may be changed in accordance with the Surviving Corporation\'s Employee Discount Policy.
  _

 13. Community Pledges_. After the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation will continue to make contributions and pledges, both verbal and by voucher, in the amounts and to the organizations set forth on Schedule 5.5(m).
  _

 14. Merger Completion Bonuses_. The Company shall pay merger completion bonuses in an aggregate amount of no more than $5,000,000 (the " _Merger Completion Bonuses_ ") (subject to applicable withholding requirements) on the Closing Date to certain designated employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The employees to whom such bonus payments will be made and the amount of each employee\'s bonus payment are listed in Schedule 5.5(n).
    

   **  5.6 **_Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and
Insurance_. 

      

 1. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and the Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless, and to the extent not prohibited by SOX, provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present (as of the Effective Time) directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Company\'s or its respective Subsidiary\'s certificate of incorporation, by-laws and indemnification agreements in existence on the date hereof with any current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (but in any event to the fullest extent permitted by law) for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), and (ii) purchase as of the Effective Time a tail policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ") to the current policy of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company which Tail Policy shall be effective for a period from the Effective Time through and including the date six years after the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, and which Tail Policy shall contain substantially the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, in the aggregate, as that coverage currently provided by such current policy. 
 

 2. To the extent permitted by the GCL and not prohibited by SOX and notwithstanding the last sentence of Section 1.5 and Section 1.6, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liability at least as favorable to the Indemnified Persons as those set forth in the current articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and for a period of six years from the Effective Time, those provisions shall not be repealed or amended or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder as of the Effective Time of the Indemnified Persons, except to the extent, if any, that such modification is required after the Effective Time by applicable law.
 

 3. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Persons on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.6 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.
 

 4. The covenants contained in this Section 5.6 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.
 

 5. In the event that the Surviving Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or assigns of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.6. 
    

   **  5.7 **_Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company
shall use reasonable commercial efforts to give prompt notice to the
Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall use reasonable commercial efforts to give
prompt notice to the Company, to the extent that either acquires actual
knowledge of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence
or non-occurrence of which would be reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate or any Schedule hereto to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect (in which case such party shall provide the other with an updated
Schedule), and (ii) any failure of the Company, Parent, Purchaser or Merger
Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however,
that the delivery of any notice or updated Schedule pursuant to this Section
5.7 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice. 

 **  5.8 **_Public Announcements_. The Parent shall develop a
communications plan for approval by the Company, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and each party shall (i) ensure that all press releases
and other public statements with respect to this Agreement, and the

communications plan, and (ii) unless otherwise required by applicable law or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange, the parties agree to consult with each other a reasonable
