this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, and Buyer shall purchase,
the Shares for the Purchase Price set forth in Section 2.2.

2.2 Purchase Price.

The purchase price to be paid by Buyer to Seller for the Shares shall be
One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000.00) subject to deductions and
adjustment as described in this Section 2.2 and Sections 2.3 and 2.4 below
(the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price shall be paid at Closing by wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

2.3 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted on a dollar-for-dollar basis based
upon the Net Working Capital of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis (it being agreed that all references in this Section 2.3 to
the Net Working Capital of the Company shall mean the Net Working Capital of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis) as of the Closing
Date, as described in this Section 2.3.



 

6 (b) In order to establish a reasonable estimate of the Net Working
Capital adjustment to the Purchase Price at Closing, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer, not less than five (5) business days prior to the Closing
Date, a detailed written statement (the "Preliminary Purchase Price
Statement") of Sellers reasonable good faith calculation of the Companys
Net Working Capital as of the date thereof (the "Preliminary Net Working
Capital"). If the Preliminary Net Working Capital is greater than the Target
Net Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be increased dollar for dollar

dollar for dollar by the amount of such difference.

2.4 Post-Closing Reconciliation.

dollar-for-dollar basis to reflect any difference between the Preliminary Net
Working Capital and the actual Net Working Capital of the Company as of the
Closing Date, as described in this Section 2.4.

(b) Seller shall, within forty-five (45) days of the Closing Date, prepare
in accordance with GAAP and deliver to Buyer a consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its Subsidiaries with reasonable supporting documentation
(the "Closing Financial Statement") setting forth the Net Working Capital of
the Company as of the Closing Date and the adjustment, if any, to the Purchase
Price required by this Section 2.4. Seller shall cause all professional fees
and expenses for accountants, lawyers and similar professional service
providers who will have provided services to or for the benefit of Company or
any Subsidiary to invoice the Company and Subsidiaries (as applicable)
before the Closing for services provided and expenses incurred through the
last day of the month immediately preceding the month during which the Closing
occurs, such that all such fees and expenses shall be reflected on the Closing
Financial Statement. If within thirty (30) days following delivery of the
Closing Financial Statement Buyer has not given Seller written notice of its
objection to the Closing Financial Statement (which notice must contain a
reasonable statement of the basis of the objection), then the Closing
Financial Statement shall be deemed to be the "Final Closing Financial
Statement" and the Net Working Capital set forth therein shall be deemed to be
the "Final Net Working Capital". If Buyer gives such notice of objection,
then Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and attempt to reach a
mutually acceptable resolution of the issues in dispute within thirty (30)
days following the delivery to Seller of such notice. If Buyer and Seller are
not able to reach a mutually acceptable resolution within such thirty (30) day
period, then the issues in dispute will be submitted to a national recognized
accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the "Accountants")
for resolution. If issues in dispute are submitted to the Accountants for
resolution, (i) each party will furnish to the Accountants such work papers
and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the
Accountants may reasonably request and are available to that party (or its
independent public accountants), and will be afforded the opportunity to
present to the Accountants any material relating to the determination and to
discuss the determination with the Accountants; (ii) the determination by the
Accountants, as set forth in a notice delivered to both parties by the
Accountants, will be binding and conclusive on the parties; and (iii) Buyer
will bear fifty percent (50%) and Seller will bear fifty percent (50%) of the
fees of the Accountants for such determination. If Buyer has given a notice of
objection in accordance with this Section 2.4(b), the Closing Financial
Statement, as agreed by the parties or modified by resolution of any disputes
with respect thereto by the Accountants, shall be the "Final Closing Financial
Statement" and the Net Working Capital set forth therein shall be deemed to be
the "Final Net Working Capital".

(c) On the fifth (5th) Business Day following the final determination of
the Final Closing Financial Statement, if the Final Net Working Capital
is greater than the Preliminary Net Working Capital, Buyer will pay such
difference to Seller in immediately available funds.

and all of the Company and the Subsidiaries and Buyers shareholders and their
respective Affiliates from and against:

(i) any and all Taxes for any and all taxable periods or portions thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Period") relating to (1)
any Consolidated Tax Return which includes or included any or all of the
Company and the Subsidiaries, (2) any other Tax Return which includes or
included any or all of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and (3) any such
Taxes described in (1) or (2) above for which any or all of the Company and

Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or 1.1502-78(b)(2) or any similar provision under
any applicable foreign, state or local law;

(ii) any Tax of, imposed on, or pertaining or attributable to, any or all
of the Company and the Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Period
that relates to tax or financial results for periods ending on or before the

21 (iii) any and all Taxes (other than Taxes described in (i) or (ii) above)
of, or attributable to, Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary or any Non-

limitation, any and all Taxes relating to the income, business,
activities, operations, property or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary

proceedings relating to any such Tax;

but only to the extent that the aggregate amount of any such amounts and Taxes
exceeds the Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiaries reflected in the
calculation of the Purchase Price adjustments pursuant to Section 2.4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have no responsibility for, and
Buyer shall be responsible for, shall pay or cause to be paid, and
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and each and all of the Non-
Company Affiliates from and against, any and all liabilities for Taxes of any

any transaction on the Closing Date that is properly allocable to the portion
of the day after the Closing that, in accordance with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B), must be treated as a transaction for all
Federal income tax purposes as occurring at the beginning of the following
day. Buyer covenants not to cause or permit the Company or any Subsidiary to
take any action on the Closing Date, or to make any tax election effective on

notice of the Dispute to the other party (a "Dispute Notice"). Upon receipt by
the other party of the Dispute Notice, such receiving party shall provide
notice to the other party within five (5) Business Days that provides the
name of a member of the management team (or representative thereof) of the
receiving party to discuss the Dispute. A meeting between such managers (or
representatives) of the parties shall take place within fifteen (15) Business
Days after the date on which the receiving party received the Dispute Notice.
If the Dispute has not been resolved within ten (10) Business Days following
such meeting, the parties further agree that any such unresolved Dispute
shall be submitted to arbitration pursuant to the procedures outlined in
Section 5.7(f).

(d) _Procedure for Consolidated Tax Returns_. Seller shall cause to be
included in the Consolidated Tax Returns of the Entravision Affiliated Group
all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit (the "Tax Items") of
the Company and the Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Periods that are required
by applicable law to be included in such Consolidated Tax Returns, shall cause
such Consolidated Tax Returns to be timely filed with the appropriate
Governmental Entity, and shall be responsible for the timely payment (and
entitled to any refund) of all Taxes due with respect to the periods covered
by such Consolidated Tax Returns (except for such Taxes as  



 

22  have been reflected in the calculation of the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.4 of this Agreement, in which event, such Taxes shall be paid by
the Company and/or the Subsidiaries). To the extent required by applicable
law or administrative practice, (a) the taxable year of the Company and each
Subsidiary that includes the Closing Date shall be treated as closing on (and
including) the Closing Date and (b) all transactions occurring on the Closing
Date but after the Closing that are properly allocable as described in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) to the portion of the
Closing Date after the Closing shall be reported on the Companys and/or
Subsidiaries Tax Returns at the beginning of the following day in accordance
with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or the corresponding
provisions of applicable state law. 

(e) _Procedure for Non-Consolidated Tax Returns_.

(i) _Preparation_. With respect to Tax Returns other than Consolidated Tax
Returns, after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and file the Companys
and each Subsidiarys state, local and foreign Tax Returns for all Taxes
consistent with past practice (to the extent permitted by Law) for the period
beginning on January 1 of the year in which the Closing occurs and ending at
the same time as the Companys and each Subsidiarys tax year closes for
federal income tax purposes (the "Short Period"), and shall deliver copies of
such Tax Returns to Buyer. In the case of any Governmental Entity that will
not permit the Companys or a Subsidiarys taxable period to be closed at such
time, for purposes of this Agreement, such period will be deemed to close at
the same time as the Companys and each Subsidiarys federal tax year closes,
and hypothetical Tax Returns shall be prepared by Seller as if such period did
close at such time. Seller shall determine the Tax Items required to be
included in each such hypothetical Tax Return with respect to the Short
Period using the same method used for determining federal taxable income,
except that (1) with respect to any real or personal property Taxes and any
franchise Taxes based on capital, the amount of such Taxes allocable to the
Short Period shall be determined by multiplying the amount of such Taxes for
the entire taxable period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in such taxable period included in the Short Period and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such taxable period (for
this purpose, however, excluding any increase in such Taxes arising solely as
a result of a change in ownership of the Company and/or the Subsidiaries due
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which increase shall be
allocated to the period beginning after the Short Period) (the "Pre-Closing
Property Taxes"), and (2) any franchise Tax paid or payable with respect to
any of the Company and the Subsidiaries shall be allocated to the taxable
period during which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the
base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business
for another taxable period is obtained by the payment of such franchise Tax.

(ii) _Filing; Payments_. Buyer shall cause the Company and
each Subsidiary to file on a timely basis all such Tax Returns (as so
prepared by Seller and as reasonably approved by Buyer) which are required to
be filed by or on behalf of the Company and the Subsidiaries for the Short
Period, or for periods which include the Short Period or the Closing Date,
and shall pay, or shall cause the payment of, all Taxes for the Short Period.
Seller shall pay to Buyer at least three (3) Business Days prior to filing of
the applicable Tax Returns any Taxes due from Seller that are attributable to
the Short Period (other than Taxes which have been previously reflected in the
calculation of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.4 of this Agreement).

(iii) _Exceptions_. Buyer shall advise Seller of any exceptions taken to
the methods of preparation of information provided and Tax Returns prepared
pursuant to this Section 5.7(e) no later than thirty (30) days after the date
on which such information or Tax Returns are received by Buyer, which shall be
no later than sixty (60) days prior to the date on which such Tax Returns are
required to be filed with the relevant Governmental Entity, including
extensions. Notice of any such exception (hereinafter referred to also as a
Dispute) shall be treated as a Dispute Notice to be handled in accordance
with the procedure provided in Section 5.7(c).

(f) _Arbitration_. The parties agree that Disputes that cannot be
resolved in accordance with the procedure provided in Section 5.7(c) shall be
submitted to arbitration pursuant to the procedures outlined in this  



 

23  Section 5.7(f) The Dispute shall be submitted to one mutually agreeable Big
Four Accounting Firm or other nationally-recognized accounting
firm; provided, however, that if Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on such
an accounting firm within a ten (10) Business Day period, then either party
may submit to the American Arbitration Association the responsibility for
selection of the accounting firm, which selection shall be final and binding
on both parties. Such accounting firm shall, within fifteen (15) Business
Days, review the prepared returns and resolve such Dispute. Seller and Buyer
agree to be bound by the decision of such accounting firm. The scope of
review by such accounting firm shall be limited to the matters in Dispute. The
cost of such accounting firm shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-half by
Buyer.

(g) _Termination of Tax Agreements_. With respect to the Company and the
Subsidiaries, Seller will cause any Tax sharing agreement, Tax allocation
agreement or similar policy to which Seller or its Affiliates is a party to be
terminated effective as of the Closing Date.

(h) _Refund Procedures_. If the Company or a Subsidiary is entitled to a
refund or credit of Taxes due to adjustments in any Pre-Closing Period that
are not the result of a reduction of the Companys or a Subsidiarys net
operating loss carryover or reduction to the net tax basis of depreciable
and/or amortizable assets as of the Closing Date , Buyer shall pay to Seller
the amount of such refund or credit promptly after receipt by the Company or
such Subsidiary, together with any interest or other amounts received from the
applicable Governmental Entity in connection therewith, less the amount of any
Tax liability of the Company, any Subsidiary or any affiliate resulting from
the receipt of such refund or credit and/or such interest; provided, that
Seller agrees to repay to Buyer the amount of such refund or credit to the
extent the Company, any Subsidiary or any other affiliate later is required to
repay such amount to the Governmental Entity.

(i) _Seller Filing Procedure_. Seller shall cause the Companys and
each Subsidiarys Tax Returns required to be filed before the Closing to be
timely filed with the appropriate Governmental Entity. For purposes of this
paragraph, such Tax Returns shall be deemed timely filed if the Company or
such Subsidiary has obtained an extension from the appropriate Governmental
Entity as to the time in which it may file such Tax Returns and such extended
due date is after the Closing Date and any Tax to be paid as a condition to
such extension has been paid. 

(j) _Post-Closing Assistance_. After the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall
provide each other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by
either of them in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, or in
connection with any audit or other examination by any Governmental Entity, or
in connection with any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to
liability for Taxes of the Company, a Subsidiary or Seller. During the period
commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the earlier of six (6) years
after the Closing Date or the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations of the applicable taxable matter, each party hereto will retain
and provide the other with any records or information which may be relevant to
such return, audit or examination, proceedings or determination. Any
information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.7(k) or pursuant to any other
Section hereof providing for the sharing of information or the review of any
Tax Return or other schedule relating to Taxes shall be kept confidential by
the parties.

(k) (i) _Contest Liability and Procedure_. Buyer agrees to give prompt
notice to Seller of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any
suit, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought under
this Section 5.7 and will give Seller such information with respect thereto as
Seller may reasonably request. Seller may, at its own expense (i) participate
in and (ii) upon notice to Buyer, assume the defense of any such suit, action
or proceeding (including any Tax audit); provided, that (A) Sellers counsel
is reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, (B) Seller shall thereafter consult with
Buyer upon Buyers reasonable request from time to time with respect to such
suit, action or proceeding (including any Tax audit), and (C) Seller shall
not, without Buyers consent agree to any settlement with respect to any Tax
if such settlement could adversely affect the Tax liability of Buyer, the
Company, any Subsidiary or any of its other affiliates in respect of Post-
Closing Tax Periods.



 

24 (ii) If Seller assumes such defense as provided in Section 5.7(k)((i)
above, (i) Buyer shall have the right to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by Seller; and (ii) Seller shall agree that
the Tax liability, or any portion thereof, with respect to which Buyer seeks
indemnity is a Tax liability for which Seller is liable under this Section
5.7. If Seller elects not to assume such defense, Buyer may pay, compromise or

applicable thereto (provided that any payments from Seller to Buyer in
respect of a Total Loss Event shall be made on the NOL / Make Whole Settlement
Date (as defined as Schedule 10.2(I)(i));

_provided_ , _however_ , that if any action, suit, proceeding, claim,
liability, demand or assessment shall be asserted against any Buyer Indemnitee
in respect of which such Buyer Indemnitee proposes to demand indemnification,
such Buyer Indemnitee shall notify Seller thereof within a reasonable period
of time (and in no event more than fifteen (15) days) after assertion thereof.
Seller shall have the right within thirty (30) days after receipt of such
notice to assume the control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any
such action, suit, proceeding, claim, liability, demand or assessment,
including, at their own expense, employment of counsel and at any time
thereafter to exercise on behalf of the Buyer Indemnitee any rights which may
mitigate any of the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Seller shall
have exercised their right to assume such control, the Buyer Indemnitee (i)

by Seller shall require the prior written consent of the Buyer Indemnitee and

assets or the operation of its business and (ii), includes an unconditional
term by which the claimant or the plaintiff gives to the Buyer Indemnitee
a full and unconditional release from all liability in respect of such claim
to be settled, then Seller may reassign the defense of such claim to the Buyer
Indemnitee, who may then continue  



 

33  to defend the claim free of any participation of Seller, at Buyer
Indemnitees sole cost and expense. In such event, the obligation of Seller
with respect thereto shall not exceed the amount of the offer of settlement
refused by Buyer Indemnitee plus the costs and expenses of Buyer Indemnitee
for which indemnity is available incurred prior to the date of the refused
settlement. Should Seller not timely notify Buyer Indemnitee of Sellers
intent to defend a claim required to be defended under the Section, Buyer
Indemnitee may defend against such claim or litigation in such manner as it
deems appropriate and the Buyer Indemnitee may settle such claim or
litigation on such terms as it may deem appropriate, all at the cost and
expense of Seller, provided, however, Seller shall have the right to approve
such settlement, with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Seller shall notify
Buyer Indemnitee in writing of its approval or disapproval of any proposed
settlement within fifteen (15) days of receipt of written notice of the
settlement from the Buyer Indemnitee. Sellers failure to timely so notify
Buyer Indemnitee shall be conclusively deemed to be approval of the proposed
settlement by Seller.

(II)

Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in respect of the
pending New York City violations proceedings referred to in Section
10.2(I)(h) (the "Violation Proceedings"), Seller hereby acknowledges its
obligation to assume at its expense the defense of such Violation Proceedings,
and Seller and Buyer further agree as follows:

(a) Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed as to status of such
matters and to provide Buyer with prompt notice of any material developments
in such Violation Proceedings. Seller consents to and shall authorize the
respective counsel for the Company and the Subsidiaries in such Violation
Proceedings to discuss from time to time with Buyers representatives the
status of the case and legal strategies being pursued therein.

(b) Seller shall defend the Violation Proceedings in the best interests of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and in substantially the same manner it has
defended such proceedings prior to the date of this Agreement, without regard
to the sale of the Shares to Buyer. 

(c) Seller shall take steps to ensure that any communications between the
Seller and counsel for the Company and the Subsidiaries remain subject to the
attorney-client privilege. Following the Closing, communications between Buyer
and counsel for the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the
attorney-client privilege.

(d) Without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Seller shall not replace
Davidoff, Malito and Hutcher, LLP as counsel for the Company and the
Subsidiaries in the Violation Proceedings.

(e) Without the prior written consent of Buyer, Seller shall not settle or
agree to settle on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary any of such
Violation Proceedings, wherein the Company or any Subsidiary is required to
take down or cease to operate for advertising purposes any of the Structures
at issue in the Violation Proceedings.

(III) 

Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in respect of (i)
the City Settlement Agreement and (ii) the matter described on _Schedule
5.7(m)_ (the "LA Tax Proceeding" and, together with the City Settlement
Agreement, the "Los Angeles Proceedings"), Buyer hereby acknowledges its
obligation to assume at its expense the defense of such Los Angeles
Proceedings (and all matters related thereto) as of the Closing, and Seller
and Buyer further agree as follows:

(a) Seller shall prior to the Closing defend the Violation Proceedings in
the best interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries and in substantially
the same manner it has defended such proceedings prior to the date of this
Agreement, without regard to the sale of the Shares to Buyer.



 

34 (b) Seller shall prior to the Closing keep Buyer reasonably informed as to
status of such matters and to provide Buyer with prompt notice of any
material developments in such Los Angeles Proceedings. Seller consents to and
shall authorize the respective counsel for the Company and the Subsidiaries in
such Los Angeles Proceedings to discuss from time to time with Buyers
representatives the status of the case and legal strategies being pursued
therein.

(c) Seller shall take steps to ensure that any communications between the
Seller and counsel for the Company and the Subsidiaries remain subject to the
attorney-client privilege. Following the Closing, communications between
Buyer and counsel for the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the
attorney-client privilege.

(d) Without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Seller shall not replace the
attorneys and advisors currently handling the Los Angeles Proceedings.

(e) Without the prior written consent of Buyer, Seller shall not agree to a
valuation methodology with respect to the Structures at issue in the L.A. Tax
Proceeding which will be binding upon the Company and/or Subsidiaries for
periods following Closing.

(f) Without the prior written consent of Seller, Buyer shall not agree to
any modification or amendment of the City Settlement Agreement that would
result in any fees, fines, penalties, expenses or other charges being imposed
by the City of Los Angeles under the City Settlement Agreement in respect of
periods prior to Closing.

10.3 Indemnification of Seller and any Affiliate of Seller.

Buyer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
affiliates, and each of their respective partners, shareholders, officers,
directors, employers and agents (individually, a "Seller Indemnitee", and
collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees"), against and in respect of any and
all Damages, caused by, resulting or arising from or otherwise relating to:

(a) any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Buyer in this
Agreement, whether or not the Seller relied thereon or had knowledge thereof;
or

(b) any breach or nonperformance of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation of Buyer under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any
failure by the Company to perform any contractual or other legal obligation
required to be performed after the Closing Date, unless the Seller have an
obligation to indemnify Buyer with respect to such liability (without regard
to the Basket);

_provided_ , _however_ , that if any action, suit, proceeding, claim,
liability, demand or assessment shall be asserted against any Seller
Indemnitee in respect of which such Seller Indemnitee proposes to demand
indemnification, such Seller Indemnitee shall notify Buyer thereof within a
reasonable period of time (and in no event more than fifteen (15) days) after
assertion thereof. Buyer shall have the right within thirty (30) days after
receipt of such notice to assume the control of the defense, compromise or
settlement of any such action, suit, proceeding, claim, liability, demand or
assessment, including, at its own expense, employment of counsel and at any
time thereafter to exercise on behalf of Seller Indemnitee any rights which
may mitigate any of the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Buyer
shall have exercised its right to assume such control, a Seller Indemnitee
(i) may, in its sole discretion, employ counsel to represent it (in addition
to-counsel employed by Buyer, and in the latter case, at such Seller
Indemnitees sole expense) in any such matter, and in such event counsel
selected by Buyer shall be required to cooperate with such counsel of such
Seller Indemnitee in such defense, compromise or settlement for the purpose of
informing and sharing information with such Seller Indemnitee and (ii)
will, at its own expense, make available to Buyer those employees of Seller
or any affiliate of Seller whose assistance, testimony or presence is
necessary to assist Buyer in evaluating and in defending any such action,
suit, proceeding, claim,  



 

35  liability, demand or assessment; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
access shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the operations of the businesses of Seller or any affiliate
of Seller. If Buyer shall have exercised its right to assume such control, any
compromise or settlement of such claim by Buyer shall require the prior
written consent of the Seller Indemnitee and until such consent is obtained
Buyer shall continue to defend the claim; provided, however, that if the
Seller Indemnitee refuses to consent to a bona fide offer of settlement that
Buyer wishes to accept and such settlement offer: (i) involves no limitation
on the Seller Indemnitees ownership or use of its assets or the operation of
its business and (ii) includes an unconditional term by which the claimant or
the plaintiff gives to the Seller Indemnitee a full and unconditional release
from all liability in respect of such claim to be settled, then Buyer may
reassign the defense of such claim to the Seller Indemnitee, who may then
continue to defend the claim free of any participation of Buyer, at
Seller Indemnitees sole cost and expense. In such event, the obligation of
Buyer with respect thereto shall not exceed the amount of the offer of
settlement refused by Seller Indemnitee plus the costs and expenses of Seller
Indemnitee for which indemnity is available incurred prior to the date of the
refused settlement. Should Buyer not timely notify Seller Indemnitee of
Buyers intent to defend a claim required to be defended under the Section,
Seller Indemnitee may defend against such claim or litigation in such manner
as it deems appropriate and the Seller Indemnitee may settle such claim or
litigation on such terms as it may deem appropriate, all at the cost and
expense of Buyer, provided, however, Buyer shall have the right to approve
such settlement, with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Buyer shall notify Seller
Indemnitee in writing of its approval or disapproval of any proposed
settlement within fifteen (15) days of receipt of written notice of the
settlement from the Seller Indemnitee. Buyers failure to timely so notify
Seller Indemnitee shall be conclusively deemed to be approval of the proposed
settlement by Buyer. 

10.4 Remedies.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall have no right or remedy to take any
action in respect of, and the Company and Seller shall have no liability to
Buyer in respect of, any breach by the Company or Seller of any of their
respective representations or warranties contained herein or a material
failure to comply with any of their covenants, conditions or agreements
contained herein, except (i) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1 hereof, in which event, the Company and Seller shall thereupon have no
obligation or liability to Buyer whatsoever hereunder; or (ii) to seek
specific performance or injunctive relief as provided in Section
10.4(c) below.

(b) After the Closing Date, the sole and exclusive remedy at law of both
Buyer and Seller hereunder or otherwise in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be restricted to the indemnification rights set
forth in this Section 10 and in Section 5.7, provided, that Seller and Buyer
reserve all rights to pursue any and all available equitable remedies. For
purposes hereof, after the Closing, any Damages suffered or incurred by the
Company or any Subsidiary shall be deemed suffered and incurred by Buyer.
After the Closing, Seller shall not be entitled to recover from the Company
or any Subsidiary any Damages arising from a breach of the representations of
the Company set forth in Section 3 or to otherwise seek any reimbursement or
other amounts from the Company or the Subsidiaries, whether under a theory
of contribution, subrogation or otherwise, for which Seller is obligated
hereunder.

(c) The Company and Seller acknowledge and agree that Buyer will be
irreparably damaged in the event of any breach by the Company or Seller of any
of their obligations to sell, assign and transfer the Shares to Buyer. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that the Company and Seller will be irreparably
damaged in the event of any breach by Buyer of its obligations to purchase the
Shares from Seller. Buyer, the Company and Seller agree that remedies
available to Buyer, the Company and Seller at law alone will be inadequate
for any breach described in this Section 10.4(c). Buyer, the Company and
Seller may enforce their rights by an action in a court of equity for a decree
of specific performance or for a temporary or permanent injunction, without
the necessity of showing actual damages or furnishing a bond or other
security, and each of Buyer, the Company and Seller expressly waives the
defense that a remedy in damages will be adequate.



 

36 10.5 Certain Limitations.

The liability of the Seller or Buyer, as applicable, for claims under Sections
10.2 and 10.3, respectively, of this Agreement shall be limited by
the following:

(a) The representations and warranties contained herein, and those
covenants contained herein to be performed or complied with prior to the
Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Covenants"), shall survive the Closing for a period
of one year ("Survival Period"), except for the representations and warranties
of the parties in Sections 3.3, 3.5, 3.7, 3.14, 3.21, 4.1, 4.2 and 5.7
(collectively, the "Excepted Representations") which shall survive the Closing
for the duration of the applicable statute of limitations. Any other provision
of this Agreement notwithstanding, no claim for indemnification under this
Section 10 by any party relating to or resulting from (i) the breach of one or
more representations other than Excepted Representations, or (ii) Pre-Closing
Covenants, by one or more other parties to this Agreement, shall be valid
unless Notice of such claim is served upon the indemnifying party within the
Survival Period.

(b) The amount of Damages otherwise recoverable under this Section 10 shall
be reduced by the amount (if any) by which any Federal, state, local or
foreign tax liabilities of the Seller Indemnitee or the Buyer Indemnitee, as
applicable, or any of their respective affiliates (including in the case of
Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries once the Closing has occurred) is
decreased by reason of any Damages actually paid to such Seller Indemnitee or
Buyer Indemnitee, as applicable, shall be entitled to indemnity under Section
10.2 or 10.3 of this Agreement.

(c) The amount of Damages otherwise recoverable by a Seller Indemnitee or
Buyer Indemnitee under Section 10.2 or 10.3 hereof with respect to any matter
which is covered by insurance, shall be reduced by the amount of insurance
cash proceeds actually paid to such indemnitee (net of any costs and
attorneys fees incurred in connection with the collection thereof), and the
Seller Indemnitee or the Buyer Indemnitee, as the case may be, hereby agree
to make a claim under any applicable insurance policy maintained by it where
such indemnitee determines in good faith that insurance coverage is available.

(d) Any payment required under this Section 10 paid to any Buyer Indemnitee
or any Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, shall be treated by Buyer and
the Seller as a further adjustment of the Purchase Price for the Shares.

(e) (i) Except for Damages (x) resulting from the inaccuracy of the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.3, 4.1 and 4.2, (y)
with respect to which Buyer is entitled to indemnification under Section 5.7
or under Sections 10.2(I)(d), 10.2(I)(f), 10.2(I)(g), 10.2(I)(h)
or 10.2(I)(i), and (z) Indebtedness with respect to which Buyer is entitled
to indemnification under Section 10.2(I)(c), other than accounts payable for
goods or services incurred in the ordinary course of business which were not
included in the calculation of Net Working Capital pursuant to Section 2.4
above, no Damages shall be recoverable by a Seller Indemnitee or Buyer
Indemnitee pursuant to the provisions of this Section 10, unless the aggregate
amount of the Seller Indemnitees or the Buyer Indemnitees, as the case may
be, Damages equals at least an amount equal to three/fourths percent (0.75%)
of the Purchase Price in the aggregate (the "Basket") and then only to the
extent such Damages exceed an amount equal to three/fourths percent (0.75%)
of the Purchase Price in the aggregate. For the avoidance of doubt, the Basket
limitations shall not apply to adjustments to the Net Working Capital
contemplated by this Agreement. 

(ii) Except for (x) Damages resulting from a breach of the representations
and warranties contained in Sections 3.3, 4.1 and 4.2, (y) with respect to
which Buyer is entitled to indemnification under Section 5.7 or under Section
10.2(I)(d), and (z) Indebtedness with respect to which Buyer is entitled to
indemnification under Section 10.2(I)(c), other than accounts payable for
goods or services incurred in the ordinary course of business which were not
included in the calculation of Net Working Capital pursuant to Section 2.4
above, which Damages are limited to an amount equal to thirty-five percent
(35%) of the Purchase Price, the aggregate amount  



 

37  of Damages recoverable pursuant to the provisions of this Section 10 by all
the Buyer Indemnitees in the aggregate shall be limited to an amount equal to
fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase Price.
