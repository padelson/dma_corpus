agrees to purchase from each Seller, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock set forth opposite the name of each Seller on Exhibit A annexed hereto

Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof.

2.2  _Purchase Price_. The purchase price payable by Purchaser for the
Company Common Stock shall be $201,000,000, less any indebtedness of the

shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the Per Share Purchase Price
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock transferred and

preparation of the Balance Sheet and in the format used for the reference
computations attached as Annex A hereto (the "Reference Computations"), and,
based on such Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Sellers representative shall

(d) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 60 days after the Closing
Date, Purchaser will cause to be prepared and delivered to Sellers
Representative a consolidated balance sheet of Company and Company
Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date (which shall
reflect fully the effectuation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) prepared in accordance with GAAP and the policies, practices and
methodologies used in connection with the preparation of the Balance Sheet and

If Sellers Representative disagrees with Purchasers calculation of Closing
Date Cash, Closing Working Capital, Closing Regulatory Capital, Closing Trust
Net Capital Assets or Closing Broker Net Capital Assets, Sellers
Representative may, within 45 days after Purchasers delivery of the Closing
Balance Sheet, deliver a notice to Purchaser disagreeing with such

(e) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to the
preceding subsection, the Purchaser and Sellers Representative shall, during

reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may
be required, the amount of Closing Date Cash, Closing Working Capital, Closing
Regulatory Capital, Closing Trust Net Capital Assets and Closing Broker Net
Capital Assets (as the case may be), which amount shall not be less than the
amount thereof shown in Purchasers calculations delivered pursuant to Section
2.3(c) nor more than the amount thereof shown in Sellers calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(d). If Purchaser and Sellers Representative
are unable to reach such agreement during such period, they shall mutually
agree upon independent accountants of nationally recognized
standing reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and Sellers Representative
(who shall not have any material relationship with the Company, Purchaser or
Sellers), promptly to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts
for the purpose of calculating Closing Date Cash, Closing Working Capital,
Closing Regulatory Capital, Closing Trust Net Capital Assets and Closing
Broker Net Capital Assets (as the case may be). In making such calculation,
such independent accountants shall consider only those items or amounts in
the Closing Balance Sheet or Purchasers calculation of Closing Date Cash,
Closing Working Capital, Closing Regulatory Capital, Closing Trust Net Capital
Assets or Closing Broker Net Capital Assets (as the case may be) as to which
Sellers have disagreed. Such independent accountants shall deliver to
Purchaser and Sellers Representative, as promptly as practicable, a report
setting forth such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding
upon Purchaser and Sellers. The cost of such review and report shall be borne
equally by Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand.

 Subsidiary is a party or has any liability, or (iii) that covers any current

(collectively, the "Company Benefit Plans"). The Company has made available to

Except as provided in Schedule 3.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained or
contributed to any "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA, nor do any of them have a current or contingent obligation to

as defined in Section 4975 of the Code and Section 406

 



23 Confidential Treatment is Requested by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.

 of ERISA which could subject the Company or its Affiliates, directors or
employees or the Company Benefit Plans or the trusts relating thereto or any
party dealing with any of the Company Benefit Plans or trusts to any tax or
penalty on "prohibited transactions" imposed by Section 4975 of the Code. No
fiduciary (as defined in ERISA Section 3(21)) has any liability for breach of
fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply in connection with
either the administration or the assets of any Company Benefit Plan.

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan (including, without limitation, the Company
401(k) Plan) intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has been
determined by the Internal Revenue Service to so qualify or has a remaining
period of time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in
which to apply for such a determination, and the trusts created thereunder
have been determined to be exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code or
a period of time remains to apply for such a determination; copies of all
determination letters or, for any Company Benefit Plan maintained under a
prototype document, opinion letters, have been delivered to Purchaser, and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of such

cause the loss of such qualification or exemption, or result in the imposition
of any excise tax or income tax on unrelated business income under the Code or
ERISA with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.

audits, investigations, examinations, actions, liens, suits, or proceedings
relating to any Company Benefit Plan other than routine claims by Persons
entitled to benefits thereunder, nor is any Company Benefit Plan the subject
of any pending (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any threatened)
investigation or audit by the Internal Revenue Service, Department of
Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other Person;

(iii) no event has occurred, and to the Knowledge of the Company there exists
no condition or set of circumstances, which presents a material risk of a
partial termination (within the meaning of Section 411(d)(3) of the Code) of
any Company Benefit Plan;

 

(iv) with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is qualified under Section
401(k) of the Code (including, without limitation, the Company 401(k) Plan),
individually and in the aggregate, no event has occurred, and there exists no
condition or set of circumstances, in connection with which the Company could
be subject to any liability (except liability for benefits claims and funding
obligations payable in the ordinary course) under ERISA, the Code or any other
applicable law. All

 employee contributions, including elective deferrals, to the Company 401(k)
Plan and any other Company Benefit Plan have been segregated from the
Companys general assets and deposited into the trust established pursuant to
such plan in a timely manner in accordance with the regulations of the U.S.
Department of Labor and other applicable law; and

(v) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has liability (contingent or
otherwise) under Section 4069 of ERISA by reason of a transfer of an
underfunded "defined benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA Section 3(35)).

(f) Except as reserved for on the Balance Sheet, the Company has no liability
or potential liability in any form whatsoever, and the Company will not have
liability or potential liability in any form whatsoever, with regard to any
Company Benefit Plan, as a result of (i) any failure to perform non-
discrimination testing on a Company Benefit Plan; (ii) any failure to timely
amend a Company Benefit Plan pursuant to applicable legislation and Internal
Revenue Service requirements; (iii) the classification or misclassification of
employees and independent contractors; or (iv) the failure to comply with
applicable law.

(g) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA) (a
"Welfare Plan") and except as set forth on Schedule 3.11(g) of the Disclosure
Schedule, (i) each Welfare Plan for which contributions are claimed by the
Company or any Subsidiary as deductions under any provision of the Code is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable requirements
pertaining to such deduction, (ii) with respect to any welfare benefit fund
(within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code) related to a Welfare Plan,
there is no disqualified benefit (within the meaning of Section 4976(b) of the
Code) that would result in the imposition of a tax under Section 4976(a) of
the Code, (iii) any Company Benefit Plan that is a group health plan (within
the meaning of Section 4980B(g)(2) of the Code) complies, and in each and
every case has complied, in all material respects with all of the applicable
requirements of applicable federal law, or any similar provisions of state
law applicable to employees of the Company or any Subsidiary or any ERISA
Affiliate of any of them. None of the Company Benefit Plans promises or
provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any Person
except as required by COBRA, and none of the Company or any Subsidiary or any
ERISA Affiliate of any of them has represented, promised or contracted
(whether in oral or written form) to provide such retiree benefits to any
employee, former employee, director, consultant or other Person, except to
the extent required by COBRA or a similarly applicable state statute and
except for the continuation of health or welfare benefits to former employees
or service providers through the end of the month in which they terminate
service, or pursuant to post-termination severance arrangements. No Company
Benefit Plan provides health benefits that are not insured through an
insurance contract other than a Code Section 125 Company Benefit Plan. Each
Company Benefit Plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally by the Company
at any time without material liability to the Company as a result thereof, and
no Company Benefit Plan, plan documentation or agreement, summary
plan description or other written communication distributed generally to
employees by its terms prohibits the Company from amending or terminating any
such Company Benefit Plan.

Period Returns"), and all Tax periods that begin before the Closing Date and

to the Sellers Representative for its review at least ten Business Days prior
to the due date thereof. The Sellers Representative shall provide its
comments to Purchaser at least five Business Days prior to the due date of

dispute regarding the proper reporting of any items on such Tax Returns, such
dispute shall be submitted to a mutually acceptable accounting firm, the

agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give the other
party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other so requests, the

such Taxes are paid by Purchaser, Purchaser shall be entitled to be
reimbursed from the Escrow for such Taxes.

Company Subsidiary), and the Sellers Representative shall cooperate in the
conduct of any audit or proceeding relating to such period, (ii) the Sellers,
acting through the Sellers Representative, shall have the right (but not the

shall extend to (i) all Taxes with respect to taxable periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) all Taxes with respect to Straddle Periods
to the extent that such Taxes are allocable to the period prior to Closing

there was any breach of any representation or warranty under Article III with
respect to such Tax or any disclosures that may have been made with respect to
Article III or otherwise. The indemnification obligations under this Section
6.7 shall apply even if the additional Tax liability results from the filing

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. 200.83



 

 amended return with respect to a pre-Closing Date transaction or period (or
portion of a period) by Purchaser, provided that Purchaser shall not cause or
permit Company or any Company Subsidiary to file an amended Tax Return with
respect to any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or any
Straddle Period unless (i) the Sellers Representative consents in its sole
discretion or (ii) Purchaser obtains a legal opinion from counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Sellers Representative that such amended return is legally
required to be filed (provided, further, that such legal opinion may not
assume any facts that are disputed in good faith by the Sellers
Representative).

6.8 _Certain Tax Refunds_. In order to promptly obtain the Tax Refunds
referred to in Section 2.4(d)(ii), Purchaser agrees that (i) it will use its
best efforts to file an application to recover estimated Tax payments
previously made in 2010 on behalf of the Company no later than the later of
(A) January 10, 2011 or (B) twenty (20) Business Days after the Closing Date,
(ii) it will use its best efforts to file amended Tax Returns or such other
U.S. federal, state and local income tax forms on behalf of the Company as may
be required to carryback its losses from 2010 to prior years no later than
March 15, 2011, and (iii) it will use its best efforts to file any state or
local estimated Tax payment refunds on behalf of the Company with respect to

services of the Companys current Tax advisor (Erhardt Keefe Steiner Hottman
PC) ("Companys Accountants") to assist it in filing all such applications
and forms and (ii) deliver to Purchaser correct and complete unaudited
financial statements for the Company for the taxable year ending December 31,
2010 from Companys Accountants on or before January 31, 2011. The costs and
expenses of Companys Accountants related to its duties hereunder shall be
split 50/50 between Purchaser and Sellers Representative. Purchaser agrees
to diligently pursue the collection of any and all Tax Refund claims referred
to in Section 2.4(d)(ii) and this Section 6.8 and to promptly pay over to
Sellers the amount of any such refunds (including any interest paid on such
refunds) that Purchaser or Company receives. To the extent Purchaser is
required to retain outside counsel to pursue the collection of any such
refunds, such counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Sellers
Representative and the reasonable costs of such outside counsel shall be the
responsibility of Sellers. In the event of any subsequent increase in the
amount of any such refunds as the result of any action by a taxing authority
or otherwise, Purchaser shall pay such increase to Sellers. In the event of
any subsequent decrease in the amount of any such refunds as the result of any
action by a taxing authority or otherwise, Purchaser shall be entitled to
recover such decrease in the manner provided for in Article X hereof.

their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(a) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force
and effect, Sellers agree to provide Purchaser and Purchasers officers,
directors, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors, agents and
other representatives (collectively, the "Purchaser Representatives"), from
time to time prior to the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement,
such information as Purchaser shall reasonably request with respect to Company
and Company Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, financial conditions
and operations and such access to the properties and personnel of Company and
Company Subsidiaries as Purchaser shall reasonably request, which access shall
occur during normal business hours and shall be conducted in such manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of Company or
Company Subsidiaries. Except as required by law, Purchaser will hold, and will
cause Purchaser Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic
information received from Sellers or Company or Company Subsidiaries, directly
or indirectly, in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) Sellers and Company shall not be required to provide access to or to

press release or make any such statement or disclosure without the prior
approval of the other (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or

obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange.

7.5 _Employees; Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide such employee benefit

plans Purchaser provides to its own employees.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate the Company 401(k)
Plan, by resolution adopted by the Companys Board of Directors reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser, and simultaneously amend the Company 401(k) Plan to
the extent necessary to comply with all applicable laws to the extent not
previously amended. Such termination shall provide that all participants
in the Company 401(k) Plan shall be fully vested in their account balances
under the Company 401(k) Plan.

(c) For purposes of their participation in employee benefit plans of
Purchaser (the "Purchaser Benefit Plans"), Purchaser shall credit each Covered

service credited under the Company Benefit Plans (including service with
Company prior to the Closing Date and, where applicable, service with prior or
predecessor employers to the extent credit is given for such service under the
Company Benefit Plans) for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting. With respect to Purchaser Benefit Plans that are welfare benefit

of Company and its Subsidiaries to their respective current and former 

 



42 Confidential Treatment is Requested by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. 

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. 200.83



 

 employees, directors and independent contractors, including, but not limited
to, all obligations under employment, severance and consulting plans and
arrangements; provided that nothing herein shall limit the right of Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate any particular plan or agreement in
accordance with its terms. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Purchaser shall cause Company to continue and honor the Companys
discretionary bonus program for 2010, consistent with past practice, up to the
amounts accrued or otherwise reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet,
including, but not limited to, the standards and timing for eligibility
to participate, calculation of the bonus amount, and the time and manner of
payment. All such bonus amounts shall be paid in full consistent with past
practices to all such eligible employees who are employed by the Company as of
the Closing Date. 

7.6 _Certain Client Matters_. Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts, or
shall cause each Company Subsidiary that is a party to an Investment Advisory
Agreement to use its reasonable best efforts, to obtain, in accordance with
applicable law and the applicable Investment Advisory Agreement, and as
promptly as practical following the date of this Agreement, such approvals,
consents or other actions, if any, by each Client party to an Investment
Advisory Agreement so that after the Closing, the applicable Company
Subsidiary may continue its applicable management, advisory or sub-advisory
relationship on terms that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable to such
Company Subsidiary than the terms of the existing Investment Advisory
Agreement of such Client. Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts, or shall
cause each Company Subsidiary that is a party to a Material Contract
described by Section 3.14(a)(vii) or (viii) of this Agreement to use its
reasonable best efforts, to obtain as promptly as practical following the date

promptly as practical following the date of this Agreement, such approvals,
consents or other actions, if any, by each counterparty to a 12b-1 Agreement
so that after the Closing the applicable Company Subsidiary may continue its
relationship with such counterparty on terms that, taken as a whole, are no
less favorable to such Company Subsidiary than the terms of the existing 12b-1
Agreement with such counterparty.

 

7.8 _Cooperation_. Following the Closing, each party agrees to cooperate in
good faith to provide information to the other party that is reasonably
necessary in connection with regulatory, legal, accounting and similar matters
of Sellers and their Affiliates on the one hand and Purchaser and its
Affiliates on the other (and not relating to any dispute, litigation
or arbitration between the parties hereto or their Affiliates). The parties
agree that any information provided pursuant to this provision shall be kept
confidential and shall not be used for any purpose except for the reason given
in the request.

7.9 _Additional Covenants of Certain Sellers_. As a material inducement for
the agreement of Purchaser and Guarantor to enter into this Agreement, and as
additional consideration therefor, each of the Specified Sellers, severally
and not jointly, does hereby covenant and agree with Purchaser and Guarantor
as follows: 

(a) (i) Each Specified Seller named in clause (i) of the definition thereof
covenants and agrees that, for a period of [****] commencing on the Closing
Date, such Specified Seller shall not, in the United States of America or
Canada, engage, directly or indirectly, whether as principal or as agent,
officer, director, employee, consultant, shareholder, or otherwise, alone or
in association with any other person, corporation or other entity, in any
Competitive Business.

(ii) Each Specified Seller named in clause (ii) of the definition thereof
covenants and agrees that, for a period of [****] commencing on the Closing
Date, such Specified Seller shall not, in the United States of America or
Canada, engage, directly or indirectly, whether as principal or as agent,
officer, director, employee, consultant, shareholder, or otherwise, alone or
in association with any other person, corporation or other entity, in any
Competitive Business.

 

(iii) For clarity, a Specified Seller shall not be deemed to have violated
Section 7.9(a) solely because such Seller is engaged as an employee or
consultant of an enterprise which has an Affiliate that conducts a Competitive
Business, provided that such Seller does not perform services, directly or
indirectly, to or for the benefit of such Affiliate.

 

(b) (i) Each Specified Seller named in clause (i) of the definition thereof
covenants and agrees that, for a period of [****] commencing on the Closing
Date, such Specified Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit the
trade of, or trade with, any person or entity that is a customer or identified
prospective customer of the Company as of the Closing Date, or was a customer
of the Company within the six-month period immediately prior to the Closing
Date (such period, the "Look-Back Period"), in each case for any purpose
relating to a Competitive Business.

 

(ii) Each Specified Seller named in clause (ii) of the definition thereof
covenants and agrees that, for a period of [****] commencing on the Closing
Date, such Specified Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit the
trade of, or trade with, any person or entity that is a customer or identified
prospective customer of the Company as of the Closing Date, or was a customer
of the Company within the Look-Back Period, in each case for any purpose
relating to a Competitive Business.

(iii) Each prospective customer of the Company as of the Closing Date is
identified in Section 7.9 of the Disclosure Schedule.

 

(c) (i) Each Specified Seller named in clause (i) of the definition thereof
covenants and agrees that, for a period of [****] commencing on the Closing
Date, such Specified Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or
induce, or attempt to solicit or induce, any person who, as of the Closing
Date is, or who during the Look-Back 

 



44 Confidential Treatment is Requested by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. 

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. 200.83



 

 Period was, an employee of the Company to leave the employ of the Company,
Purchaser, or any Affiliate of Purchaser for any purpose relating to a
Competitive Business.

 

(ii) Each Specified Seller named in clause (ii) of the definition thereof
covenants and agrees that, for a period of [****] commencing on the Closing
Date, such Specified Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or
induce, or attempt to solicit or induce, any person who, as of the Closing
Date is, or who during the Look-Back Period was, an employee of the Company
to leave the employ of the Company, Purchaser, or any Affiliate of Purchaser
for any purpose relating to a Competitive Business.

(d) Each Specified Seller agrees that the restrictions set forth in this
Section 7.9 are narrowly tailored to protect the legitimate interests of the
parties and are reasonable. If, however, at the time of enforcement of any of
the provisions of this Section 7.9 a court holds that the restrictions stated
therein are unreasonable under the circumstances then existing or are
otherwise illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect by reason of its
duration, definition of geographic area or scope of activity, or any other
reason, the parties hereto agree that the maximum period, scope or
geographical area reasonable or otherwise enforceable under such circumstances
shall be deemed automatically substituted for the stated period, scope or
area, but the validity, legality and enforceability of such provision shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby in any other jurisdiction and
the remainder of this Section 7.9 shall remain in full force and effect.

(e) Each Specified Seller agrees that in the event of any breach by such
Specified Seller of any of such Specified Sellers covenants or agreements
contained herein, Purchaser would suffer substantial and irrevocable damage
which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated in an action of law and
Purchaser would not have an adequate remedy at law in such event and,
therefore, in addition to any other remedy Purchaser may have at law or in
equity in the event of any such breach, Purchaser shall be entitled to seek
and receive specific performance and temporary, preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief from any breach of any of the covenants or agreements of
this Agreement from any court of competent jurisdiction without the necessity
of proving the amount of any actual damages to it resulting from such breach.

(f) Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Section 7.9, nothing herein
shall prohibit a Specified Seller from investing in stock, bonds or other
securities of any publicly traded entity (but without otherwise participating
in the business of such entity) which engages in a Competitive Business;
provided, that such investment in any class of securities of such entity does
not exceed [****] percent ([****]%) of the outstanding shares or principal
amount of such class.

 

7.10 _Trinity Lease_. Bluff Point Associates Corp. ("Bluff Point") shall make
all remaining payments due under the Lease, dated February 1, 2001, by and
between the Rector, Church-Wardens and Vestrymen of Trinity Church in the City
of New York and Optech Systems, Inc. (the "Trinity Lease"). Bluff Point hereby
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser harmless from any and all
obligations under the Trinity Lease related to the period after the Closing
Date.

pursuant to [****] shall not exceed $[****] in the aggregate or, as to
an individual Seller, such Sellers Pro Rata Share of Damages. A Sellers
"Pro Rata Share" of Damages shall be equal to the amount of such Damages
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares
of Company Common Stock transferred by such Seller to Purchaser at Closing
and the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock transferred by all Sellers to Purchaser at Closing. The maximum
liability for the several obligations of each Specified Seller under Section
7.9 shall not exceed the amount of gross proceeds payable to such Specified
Seller under this Agreement for all Company Common Stock transferred by such
Seller at the Closing. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the obligations of Bluff Point under Section 7.10 shall not be
subject to the dollar limitations set forth above.

10.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the remaining provisions of
this Article X, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold Sellers and their
respective officers, directors, managers, partners, employees, agents,
advisers, trustees, representatives and Affiliates (collectively, the "Sellers
Indemnitees") harmless from and after the Closing Date for the period set
forth in Section 10.1 (including any extension thereof as expressly provided
for in such Section) from and against any Damages incurred or suffered by the
Sellers Indemnitees to the extent resulting or arising from (a) any inaccuracy
in any of the representations and warranties made herein by Purchaser (for
this purpose disregarding any qualification or limitation as to materiality or
a material adverse effect), and (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of
Purchaser made herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing with respect to Damages
arising under this Section 10.3 (and except for Damages resulting from
breaches of the Designated Purchaser Representations), (i) Purchaser shall not
be liable to indemnify Sellers Indemnitees against Damages unless and until
the aggregate amount of such Damages exceeds $[****] and then only to the
extent of such excess, and (ii) Purchasers maximum liability to the Sellers
Indemnitees for Damages shall not exceed $[****]).

 

10.4 _Indemnification Procedure_.

(a) Promptly after the incurrence of any Damages by the party seeking
indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified Party"), including, without
limitation, any claim by a third party described in Section 10.4(d) hereof,
which might give rise to indemnification hereunder or the discovery of any
facts or circumstances that the Indemnified Party believes may result in an
indemnification claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
party from which indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") a
certificate (the "Claim Certificate"), which Claim Certificate shall:

 

(i) state that the Indemnified Party has paid or properly accrued Damages, or
anticipates that it shall incur liability for Damages for which such
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement;
and

 



50 Confidential Treatment is Requested by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. 

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. 200.83



 

(ii) specify in reasonable detail each individual item of Damages included in
the amount so stated to the extent known, the date such item was paid or
properly accrued (if applicable), the basis for any anticipated liability and
the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant
or claim to which each such item is related and the computation of the
amount, if reasonably capable of computation to which such Indemnified Party
claims to be entitled hereunder; provided, however, that the failure to
deliver such Claim Certificate shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations hereunder except to the extent such failure shall have
prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 

(b) In case the Indemnifying Party shall object to the indemnification of an
Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims specified in any Claim
Certificate, the Indemnifying Party shall, within 10 Business Days after
receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such Claim Certificate, deliver to the
Indemnified Party a written notice to such effect and the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall, within the 10 Business Day period
beginning on the date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of such written
objection, attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims to which the Indemnifying Party
shall have so objected. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall succeed in reaching agreement on their respective rights with respect to
any of such claims, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
promptly prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth such agreement. Should
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party be unable to agree as to any
particular item or items or amount or amounts, then the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party shall submit such dispute to arbitration pursuant to
Section 11.7.

(c) Claims for Damages specified in any Claim Certificate to which an
Indemnifying Party shall not object in writing within 10 Business Days of
receipt of such Claim Certificate, claims for Damages covered by a memorandum
of agreement of the nature described in Section 10.4(b) and claims for
Damages the validity and amount of which have been the subject of a Final
Determination under Section 11.7, are hereinafter referred to, collectively,
as "Agreed Claims." Within 10 Business Days of the determination of the
amount of any Agreed Claims, subject to the limitations of this Article X, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to the
Agreed Claim by cashiers check or wire transfer to the bank account or
accounts designated in writing by the Indemnified Party not less than one
Business Day prior to such payment. Any such amount required to be paid by
Sellers shall be paid from the Escrow Amount.

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. 200.83



 

(d) Promptly after the assertion by any third party of any claim against any
Indemnified Party that in the reasonable judgment of such Indemnified Party
may result in the incurrence by such Indemnified Party of Damages for which
such Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a
written notice describing in reasonable detail such claim and such
Indemnifying Party may, at its option, assume the defense of the Indemnified
Party against such claim (including the employment of counsel, who shall be
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party) at such Indemnifying
Partys expense. Any failure on the part of the Indemnified Party to provide
prompt notice shall not limit any of the obligations of the
Indemnifying Party (except to the extent such failure prejudices the defense
of such claim). Any Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in any such action or claim and to participate in the defense thereof,
but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to assume such control, and shall be responsible for the
fees and expenses of the Indemnified Partys counsel, if (i) the Indemnifying
Party shall have failed, within 15 Business Days after having been notified by
the Indemnified Party of the existence of such claim as provided in the
preceding sentence, to assume the defense of such claim or to notify the
Indemnified Party in writing that it shall assume the defense of such claim,
(ii) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in
writing by the Indemnifying Party, (iii) the named parties to any such action
(including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by
counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the
Indemnified Party which are not available to, or the assertion of which would
be adverse to the interests of, the Indemnified Party, or (iv) the Indemnified
Party shall have been advised in writing by counsel that the assumption of
such defense by the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to an
actual or potential conflict of interest (provided that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of counsel
for all Indemnified Parties, other than local counsel). No Indemnifying Party
shall be liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party for any settlement of any
such action or claim effected without the consent of the Indemnifying Party,
but if settled with the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, or if
there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the
Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party
from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement
or judgment, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article X. If the
Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of any claim in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 10.4(d), the Indemnifying Party shall obtain
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld) before entering into any settlement of such claim if
the settlement does not release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such claim, the settlement is in excess of the
maximum liability set forth in Section 10.2 or 10.2, as applicable, or the
settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party each
agrees to fully cooperate in all matters covered by this Section 10.4(d),
including, as required, the furnishing of books and records, personnel and
witnesses and the execution of documents, in each case as necessary for any
defense of such third party claim and at no

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. 200.83



 

 cost to the other party (provided that any reasonable out-of-pockets
expenses of the Indemnified Party incurred in connection with the foregoing
shall be considered part of Damages hereunder). 

10.5 _Certain Offsets; Tax Treatment of Payments_. For purposes of this
Article X, "Damages" shall be net of any insurance or other recoveries
payable to the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection with the
facts giving rise to the right of indemnification. In addition, any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this Article X shall be reduced by
the amount of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party
through a reduction in Taxes otherwise due as a result of the Damages incurred
or suffered by the Indemnified Party. The parties agree to treat any payment
pursuant to this Article X (other than the portion treated as interest) as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

10.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing Date, this Article X shall provide
the exclusive remedy for any of the matters addressed herein or other claims
arising out of this Agreement, except in the case of (i) any breach of Section
7.9 by a Specified Seller, (ii) any breach of Section 7.10 by Bluff Point,
(iii) common law fraud or (iv) with respect to matters for which the remedy of
specific performance, injunctive relief or other non-monetary equitable
remedies are available. Any amount required to be paid by Sellers under this
Article X shall be paid from the Escrow Amount; provided, that (x) any amount
required to be paid by a Specified Seller in respect of a breach by such
Specified Seller of its obligations under Section 7.9 shall be paid by such
Specified Seller directly and (y) any amount required to be paid by Bluff
Point under Section 7.10 shall be paid by Bluff Point directly, and neither
shall be paid from or otherwise reduce the Escrow Amount.

ARTICLE XI

11.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not

11.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules
and other documents and the instruments referred to herein) constitutes the
entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
other than the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

11.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law.

11.7 _Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) The arbitration procedure set forth in this Section 11.7 shall be the sole
and exclusive method for resolving and remedying any Dispute, except as
provided in Section 2.3. Any notices or other communications required to be
delivered to Sellers under this Section 11.7 shall be delivered to Sellers
Representative in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in Section
11.2.

(b) If a party asserts that a Dispute exists, such party shall deliver a
written notice to the other parties specifying the nature of the asserted
Dispute and requesting a meeting to attempt to resolve the same. If no
resolution is reached within 45 days after delivery of such notice, the party
delivering the notice of Dispute may, within 75 days after delivery of the
notice of Dispute, commence arbitration hereunder by delivering to the other
party a notice of arbitration (a "Notice of Arbitration") and by filing a copy
of such Notice of Arbitration with the New York, New York office of the
American Arbitration Association. The Notice of Arbitration shall specify the
matters as to which arbitration is sought, the nature of the Dispute, the
claims of the party lodging the Notice of Arbitration and the amount
and nature of damages or other relief sought to be recovered and any other
matters required to be included therein by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
the American Arbitration Association as in effect from time to time.

 

(c) The arbitration shall be conducted in New York, New York under the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association as in
effect from time to time, except as otherwise set forth herein or as modified
by the agreement of Sellers and Purchaser. The arbitration shall be
confidential. If the amount in controversy is less than $500,000, the
arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. If the amount
in controversy is equal to or greater than $500,000, the arbitration shall be
conducted by three neutral arbitrators. The arbitrator shall conduct the
arbitration such that a final result, determination, finding, judgment and/or
award (the "Final Determination") is made or rendered as soon as practicable,
but in no event later than 120 days after the delivery of the Notice of
Arbitration nor later than 30 days following completion of the arbitration.
The Final Determination shall be made in writing, shall

 



55 Confidential Treatment is Requested by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. 

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. 200.83



 

 state the basis for the determination and shall be agreed upon and signed by
the arbitrator(s). The Final Determination shall be final and binding on all
parties to the arbitration, and there shall be no appeal from or
reexamination of the Final Determination, except for fraud, perjury, evident
partiality or misconduct by an arbitrator prejudicing the rights of a party or
to correct manifest clerical errors. All costs, expenses and fees of the
arbitrator and the American Arbitration Association pursuant to this Section
11.7 shall be borne equally by Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the
other hand.

 

(d) A party to the arbitration may enforce the Final Determination in any
state or federal court having jurisdiction over the Dispute. For the purpose
of any action or proceeding instituted with respect to any Final
Determination, each party hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of
such court, irrevocably consents to the service of process by registered mail
or personal service and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection which it may have or hereafter have as to
personal jurisdiction, the laying of the venue of any such action or
proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such action or
proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall prevent any
party (i) from applying to any state or federal court of competent
jurisdiction for the remedies of specific performance, injunctive relief or
other non-monetary equitable remedies or (ii) from instituting litigation to
enforce any Final Determination.

11.8 _Attorneys  Fees_. In the event any party initiates any legal action
(including an arbitration pursuant to Section 11.7) to enforce the provisions
of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to the recovery of
reasonable attorneys fees and costs in such action.

 

11.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms
or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision
of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

11.10 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement
(including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended
to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder.
