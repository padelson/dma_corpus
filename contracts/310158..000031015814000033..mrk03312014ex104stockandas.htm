manufacture, market, promote, distribute, sell, offer for sale or otherwise
commercialize, any Rx Product (other than a Polaramine Rx Product) worldwide
or any Polaramine Rx Product worldwide other than in the Excluded Countries.

2.4. Nonassignable Assets.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that
the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery or attempted
sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery to Buyer of any
asset that would be a Transferred Asset or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom is prohibited by any applicable Law
or would require any governmental or third party authorizations, approvals,
consents or waivers, and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers
shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing shall proceed
without the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of
such asset. In the event that the Closing proceeds without the transfer,
sublease or assignment of any such asset, then (i) if such asset is a Current
Asset, such asset shall be regarded as a Transferred Asset for purposes of the
calculations required under Sections 2.8 and 2.9 and (ii) following the
Closing, the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts, and
cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly such authorizations, approvals,
consents or waivers; provided, however, that none of the parties shall be
required to pay any consideration therefor. From and after the Closing, the
parties shall cooperate with each other in any mutually agreeable,
commercially reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide (x) to
Buyer and its Affiliates the benefits of use of an Other Contract Right or,
pending receipt of all applicable authorizations, approvals, consents or
waivers, such asset and (y) to Seller and its Affiliates the benefits,
including any indemnities, that they would have obtained had the asset or
Other Contract Right been conveyed to Buyer and its Affiliates at the Closing.
Once authorization, approval, consent or waiver for the sale, assignment,
sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such asset not sold,
assigned, subleased, transferred, conveyed or delivered at the Closing is
obtained, Seller shall or shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver such asset to Buyer at no additional cost. With
respect to any such asset, if such consent is not obtained, or if an attempted
assignment thereof would be ineffective or would affect the rights of Seller
or its Affiliate(s) thereunder so that Buyer would not in fact receive all
such rights, Seller will, to the extent not prohibited by or not in violation
of any such agreement, (a) cooperate with Buyer in any mutually agreeable,
commercially reasonable and lawful arrangement designed to provide for Buyer
the benefits (including the exercise of Seller's or such Affiliates' rights)
under any such asset or Other Contract Right, including enforcement for the
benefit of Buyer of any and all rights of Seller or such Affiliates against a
third party thereto arising out of the breach or cancellation by such third
party or otherwise, (b) hold all monies paid to Seller or such Affiliates
thereunder on and after the Closing Date in trust for the account of Buyer,
and (c) remit such money to Buyer as promptly as possible. Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that to the extent that



Buyer or any of its Affiliates is allowed the benefits or use of any Contract
or other asset or any claim or right or benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom pursuant to this Section 2.4, including while any third
party consent or novation relating thereto has not been obtained, such
Contract or other asset shall be treated as a Transferred Asset for purposes
of Section 3.10 and Article X.

2.5. Retained Assets.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller and its
Affiliates shall retain, and shall not be obligated to sell, transfer, assign
or deliver to Buyer, their respective rights, titles or interests in or to the
Retained Assets.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, "Retained Assets" mean the following:

or any of its Affiliates generally and not relating primarily to the

as an active pharmaceutical ingredient to a pharmaceutical product for which a
prescription from a health care professional is not needed in order for a
consumer to buy or use such pharmaceutical product ("OTC"), including any Drug
Approval Applications for an OTC version of a pharmaceutical product that
contains montelukast sodium, rizatriptan benzoate or mometasone furoate
(excluding any nasally inhaled pharmaceutical product containing mometasone
furoate monohydrate (Nasonex) in the markets set forth in Annex A) as an
active pharmaceutical ingredient; and

(xvi) any assets or properties set forth in Section 2.5(b) of the Seller

contrary contained herein, "Retained Assets" includes all assets, property,
rights and interests of Seller and its Affiliates with respect to the Rx
Product Business other than the Transferred Rx Product Assets.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, on or prior to
the Closing, Seller shall, if it deems necessary or appropriate, cause the

Affiliates, any right, title and interest of any of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in and to those assets, rights and properties, which, if held by
any Company or any Subsidiary of any Company, would constitute a Retained
Asset, for such consideration (or no consideration) as shall be determined by
Seller.

2.6. Assumption of Liabilities.

Effective as of the Closing, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall
have any liability or obligation with respect to, and Buyer shall assume and
thereafter pay, perform and discharge when due, all liabilities and
obligations of Seller and its Affiliates, whether relating to periods prior
to, on, or after the Closing, to the extent related to or arising from, the
Transferred Consumer Care Assets, the Consumer Care Business, the Transferred
Rx Product Assets, the Rx Product Business and/or the Conveyed Sites, other
than the Retained Liabilities (collectively, the "Assumed Liabilities")
(provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.6,
(i) any liabilities or obligations of the Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries shall not constitute Assumed Liabilities, it being acknowledged
and agreed that such liabilities or obligations (other than Retained
Liabilities) shall remain the liabilities or obligations, as applicable, of
the Companies or their applicable Subsidiaries immediately after the Closing,
and (ii) nothing in this Section 2.6 shall affect Buyer's rights pursuant to
Article X), including, without limitation:

(a) all obligations and liabilities under the Material Contracts to which any
member of the Seller Group is a party or by which it is bound, to the extent
relating to the Consumer Care Business;

(b) all liabilities of Schering-Plough Canada, Inc. for accounts payable,
which liabilities shall be included in the calculation of Closing Date Net
Working Capital;

(c) (i) with respect to the Transferred Employees (other than the Company

relating to vacation and sick leave, and (ii) with respect to the Transferred
Employees (other than the Company Employees) that are employed in a
jurisdiction other than the United States, obligations and liabilities of
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Companies or their Subsidiaries)
relating to vacation, holiday pay, annual leave and sick leave and all other
obligations and liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates that are required to
be assumed by Buyer or its Affiliates under applicable Laws in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions;

(d) any Taxes for which Buyer is responsible under Section 6.1 of this
Agreement;

(e) any obligations or liabilities to the extent relating to the Consumer Care

2.7. Retained Liabilities.

Seller shall, without any further responsibility or liability of, or recourse

agents, consultants, representatives, Affiliates, successors or assigns
(including the Companies and their Subsidiaries), absolutely and irrevocably
assume and be solely liable and responsible for the following obligations and

Disclosure Schedule (the "Section 2.7(d) Liabilities"); and

(e) the China Obligations.

2.8. Purchase Price; Payments at the Closing.

(a) The purchase price to be paid by Buyer to Seller for the Company Common
Stock and the Transferred Assets, and the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities, shall be Fourteen Billion Two Hundred Million Dollars
($14,200,000,000) (the "Base Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment as
provided in this Article II.

(b) Not fewer than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a written statement (the "Closing Date Statement") setting
forth Seller's good faith estimate of Closing Date Net Working Capital,
calculated in the same manner as the Illustrative Closing Date Net Working
Capital is calculated in Exhibit A ("Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital") and either (i) the amount, if any, by which such estimate exceeds
Target Net Working Capital (any such amount, an "Estimated Working Capital
Excess") or (ii) the amount, if any, by which such estimate is less than
Target Net Working Capital (any such amount, an "Estimated Working Capital
Deficit"). Buyer shall have the opportunity to review all materials and
information used by Seller in preparing such estimate, the Estimated Closing
Cash Amount and the Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount, and Seller shall
make available such personnel as are reasonably necessary to assist Buyer in
its review of the foregoing.



(c) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller the Base Purchase Price, plus
the amount of any Estimated Working Capital Excess or less the amount of any
Estimated Working Capital Deficit (the "Closing Consideration Amount"). The
Closing Consideration Amount shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account in New York, New York, which account shall be
designated by Seller no fewer than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date.

(d) The Closing Date Statement shall, in addition to the adjustments set forth
in Section 2.8(b), also include Seller's good faith estimate of Closing Date
Cash (the "Estimated Closing Cash Amount") and Closing Date Indebtedness (the
"Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount"). If the Closing Date Statement
indicates an Estimated Closing Cash Amount of greater than zero, the Closing
Consideration Amount shall be increased by the amount of such excess. If the
Closing Date Statement indicates an Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount of
greater than zero, the Closing Consideration Amount shall be decreased by the
amount of such excess. Any adjustments made pursuant to this Section 2.8(d)
shall be made without duplication of any adjustment made with respect to
Closing Date Net Working Capital.

(e) Allocation.

(i) Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing, Seller shall
prepare and set forth in a schedule (the "Allocation Schedule"), a proposed
allocation of the Closing Consideration Amount (as adjusted pursuant to this
Agreement) plus any liabilities properly taken into account for U.S. federal
Income Tax purposes. Such allocation shall be made among the stock of each
Company, each of the Transferred Assets and each of the assets of each Section
338(h)(10) Company, and shall be consistent with applicable Law. The
Allocation Schedule shall be amended by the parties hereto to reflect any
subsequent adjustments to the purchase price.

(ii) If Buyer disagrees with any item in the Allocation Schedule, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute. If Buyer and Seller are
unable to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) days, they shall jointly
select one appraisal expert (the "Accounting Firm"). As promptly as
practicable thereafter (and in any event within five (5) Business Days), Buyer
and Seller shall each prepare and submit a presentation detailing each party's
complete statement of proposed resolution of the dispute to the Accounting
Firm. As soon as practicable thereafter (and in any event within thirty (30)
days), Buyer and Seller shall cause the Accounting Firm to choose one of the
parties' positions based solely upon the presentations by Buyer and Seller.
The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated to and
borne by Buyer and Seller based on the inverse of the percentage that the
Accounting Firm's determination (before such allocation) bears to the total
amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the Accounting
Firm. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and
the Accounting Firm determines that $600 should be allocated in accordance
with Seller's position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by Buyer
and 40% of the costs would be borne by Seller. All determinations made by the
Accounting Firm shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties absent
manifest error.

(iii) Seller and Buyer shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
not to, take any position on any Tax Return, in connection with any Tax Claim,
or



otherwise, that is inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule, as amended for
resolution of disputes or adjustments to the purchase price, unless required
by applicable Law.

2.9. Post-Closing Purchase Price Determination.

(a) After Closing, Buyer shall prepare and, within ninety (90) days after
Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller, a statement, prepared in accordance
with the Illustrative Purchase Price Adjustment Statement in Exhibit B,
setting forth Buyer's determination of (i) Closing Date Net Working Capital,
calculated in the same manner as the Illustrative Closing Date Net Working
Capital is calculated in Exhibit A, (ii) Closing Date Cash and (iii) Closing
Date Indebtedness (the "Purchase Price Adjustment Statement"). For the purpose
of preparing the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, Buyer shall conduct a
physical stock-take of the inventory included in Current Assets and located at
the Companies', their Subsidiaries' and Schering-Plough Canada, Inc.'s
material warehouses; Seller (or its representatives) shall participate in such
stock-take. To the extent that the quantities included on the count sheets of
such stock-take are jointly agreed by Buyer and Seller, such results shall be
binding on the parties hereto for purposes of determining the Closing Date Net
Working Capital set forth in the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement and the
Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement. To the extent that there are any
disputes with respect to the results of the stock-take, such disputes shall be
resolved in accordance the procedures set forth in this Section 2.9. For the
avoidance of doubt, movements in items of physical inventory that are counted
after Closing will need to be reconciled (rolled) back to 11:59 P.M. (Eastern
time) on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date to demonstrate
applicability for purposes of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment.

(b) If Seller disagrees with the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, Seller
shall notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement within forty-five (45) days
after delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, which notice (a
"Purchase Price Dispute Notice") shall describe in reasonable detail the
nature of such disagreement, including the specific items involved and the
dollar amounts thereof (the "Dispute Amounts"). Once delivered, Seller may not
modify or amend the Purchase Price Dispute Notice. If Seller does not deliver
a Purchase Price Dispute Notice within such forty-five (45)-day period, the
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as delivered by Buyer to Seller, shall be
the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement. If Seller delivers a Purchase
Price Adjustment Notice within such forty-five (45)-day period, then the
Dispute Amounts shall be resolved pursuant to Section 2.9(c).

(c) Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any Dispute
Amounts and, if the parties are able to resolve all Dispute Amounts, the
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as modified to reflect such resolution,
shall be the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement. If Buyer and Seller
are unable to resolve all Dispute Amounts within twenty (20) days after
delivery of a Purchase Price Dispute Notice, then the Dispute Amounts shall be
referred for final determination to the Accounting Arbitrator within fifteen
(15) days after the end of such twenty (20)-day period. If such firm is unable
to serve or has served as a consultant in the Contemplated Transactions, Buyer
and Seller shall jointly select an Accounting Arbitrator from an accounting
firm of national standing that is not the independent auditor of (and did not
otherwise serve as a consultant on the Contemplated Transactions to) either
Buyer or the Companies or their respective Affiliates. If Buyer and Seller are
unable to agree upon an alternative Accounting Arbitrator within such fifteen
(15)-day period, then the Accounting



Arbitrator shall be an accounting firm of national standing designated by the
American Arbitration Association in New York, New York (which is not the
independent auditor of (and did not otherwise serve as a consultant on the
Contemplated Transactions to) either Buyer or the Companies or their
respective Affiliates). The Accounting Arbitrator shall consider only those
Dispute Amounts which Buyer and Seller have been unable to resolve. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within sixty (60) days after its appointment, a
written report setting forth the resolution of such Dispute Amounts. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall select as a resolution the position of either
Buyer or Seller for each Dispute Amount (based solely on presentations and
supporting material provided by the parties and not pursuant to any
independent review) and may not impose an alternative resolution. Such report
shall be final and binding upon the parties. Upon the decision of the
Accounting Arbitrator, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as adjusted to
the extent necessary to reflect the Accounting Arbitrator's decision, shall be
the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement. The fees, costs and expenses of
the Accounting Arbitrator shall be allocated to and borne by Buyer and Seller
based on the inverse of the percentage that the Accounting Arbitrator's
determination (before such allocation) bears to the total amount of the total
items in dispute as originally submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator. For
example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the
Accounting Arbitrator awards $600 in favor of Seller's position, 60% of the
costs of its review would be borne by Buyer and 40% of the costs would be
borne by Seller.

2.10. Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) In the event that Closing Date Net Working Capital as reflected on the
Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement is greater than Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital by more than $250,000, Buyer shall pay Seller an
amount equal to the difference between the Closing Date Net Working Capital
and the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital. In the event that Closing
Date Net Working Capital as reflected on the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement is less than Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital by more than
$250,000, Seller shall pay Buyer an amount equal to the difference between the

Buyer, threatened against or involving Buyer which questions the validity of
this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Documents to which it is a party or

at the Closing and all other amounts payable by Buyer under Article II as
required by and in accordance with this Agreement. As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred which would result in any breach or violation of or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both

Seller Disclosure Schedule, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of

Agreement, no consent of Buyer shall be required with respect to any matter
set forth in this



Section 5.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the extent that the requirement
of such consent would violate or conflict with applicable Law.

5.2. Access to Information Prior to the Closing.

During the period from the date hereof through the Closing Date, Seller shall,
and shall cause the Companies and their Subsidiaries to, give Buyer and its
authorized representatives reasonable access during regular business hours to
all offices, facilities and personnel, and the Books and Records and the Rx
Product Regulatory Documentation, as applicable, as Buyer may reasonably
request; provided, that (a) Buyer and its representatives shall take such
action as is deemed necessary in the reasonable judgment of Seller to schedule
such access and visits through a designated officer of Seller and in such a
way as to avoid disrupting in any material respect the normal operations of
the Transferred Business, (b) neither Seller nor the Companies nor their
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action to the extent that such
action would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege
(provided, however, that access and information shall be disclosed or granted,
as applicable, to external counsel for Buyer to the extent reasonably required
for the purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws, subject to prior
execution of a common interest or joint defense agreement in customary form)
or would compromise Seller's confidential information not related to the
Transferred Business, (c) neither Seller nor the Companies nor their
Subsidiaries shall be required to supply Buyer with any information to the
extent that doing so would violate any applicable Law or Contract (provided
that Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third
party consents that would permit the supply of such information), (d) in no
event shall Buyer be permitted to conduct any invasive testing of the Conveyed
Sites or the Leased Real Property or the building, or improvements thereon,
including without limitation sampling of soil, sediment, groundwater, surface
water or building material, (e) Buyer's access to the Tax information, books
and records of Seller, the Companies, and the Companies' Subsidiaries shall be
governed exclusively by Article VI, (f) in the event that Buyer requests
information about a directly or indirectly identified or identifiable
individual natural person ("Personal Data"), Buyer shall enter into a Personal
Data Transfer Agreement with Seller covering the type and permitted uses and
disclosures of the Personal Data, and Seller shall not be required to provide
any Personal Data to Buyer that is not expressly addressed in a duly executed
Personal Data Transfer Agreement, and (g) no investigation by, or information
furnished to, Buyer or its representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made by Seller herein, any covenants or
agreements by Seller hereunder or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties to consummate the Contemplated Transactions set forth in Article VII.

5.3. Regulatory Filings; Efforts.

(a)Buyer and, where applicable, Seller shall make or cause to be made all
filings required pursuant to the HSR Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and other Antitrust Laws of the jurisdictions set forth in Section
5.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than
twenty (20) Business Days from the date hereof). Buyer and Seller each shall
(i) promptly supply the other party with any information which may be required
in order to effectuate such filings, (ii) respond as promptly as practicable
to any inquiries received from the United States Federal Trade Commission
("FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the United States



Department of Justice ("DOJ"), or by any other Governmental Authority, and
(iii) agree not to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into
any agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the other
party not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Buyer and Seller each shall
(w) promptly notify the other party of any material communication between that
party and the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority; (x) consult
with the other party, to the extent practicable, in advance of participating
in any substantive meeting or discussion with the FTC, the DOJ, or any other
Governmental Authority with respect to any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning the Contemplated Transactions and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat; (y) subject to applicable Law, discuss with and permit
the other party (and its counsel) to review in advance, and consider in good
faith the other party's reasonable comments in connection with, any proposed
filing or communication to the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Governmental
Authority concerning the Contemplated Transactions or relating to any
investigation, inquiry or other proceeding in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions; and (z) to the extent practicable and subject to applicable Law,
furnish the other party with copies of all written correspondence and
communications between them and their Affiliates and their respective
representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions. Without limiting the provisions of Section 5.3(b) and upon the
terms and conditions set forth herein, each of the parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to make effective as
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the End Date, the
Contemplated Transactions, including obtaining HSR clearance and approvals, if
any, from the Governmental Authorities set forth in Section 5.3 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule.

(b)In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Buyer shall take any
and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate impediments or objections, if
any, that may be asserted with respect to the Contemplated Transactions under
any Antitrust Law so as to enable the parties hereto to close the Contemplated
Transactions as promptly as practicable, including (i) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, disposition, license of any assets,
properties, businesses, rights, or product lines of Buyer, the Transferred
Business, or their respective Subsidiaries, or any interests therein, and (ii)
otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date
would limit Buyer's freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability
to retain, one or more of the assets, properties, businesses, rights, or
product lines of Buyer, its Subsidiaries and/or the Transferred Business, in
each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any decree, Order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) that would restrain, prevent, or delay the Closing. Buyer shall
use its best efforts to defend through Litigation any claim asserted in court
by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
decree or preliminary injunction that would restrain, prevent, or delay the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to require Buyer to defend through Litigation any claim asserted in
court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any permanent injunction or administrative litigation that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing.



5.4. Employee Matters.

(a)Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall (i) make offers of employment on an at-
will basis to each Business Employee employed in the United States who is not
a Company Employee (including those on short term disability), with such
offers to be effective as of the Closing, (ii) continue to employ (where
employment continues automatically by operation of Law or where employer
substitution or similar transfer method is possible under applicable Law) each
Business Employee employed outside of the United States who is not a Company
Employee (including those on short term disability), effective as of the
Closing Date, (iii) make offers of employment to (where employment does not
continue automatically by operation of law or where employer substitution or
similar transfer method is not possible under applicable Law) each Business
Employee employed outside of the United States who is not a Company Employee
(including those on short term disability), with such offers to be effective
as of the Closing (each offer described in (i) and (iii), an "Employment
Offer"); provided, however, that Buyer shall in no event be obligated to make
an Employment Offer to any Business Employee who is on long-term disability
leave as of immediately prior to the Closing. Except as required by Law,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Employment Offer with respect to any
Business Employee who is both (A) not actively at work due to short-term
disability or other approved leave (but not including long-term disability
leave) as of immediately prior to the Closing, and (B)(1) in the case of a
Business Employee on short-term disability based in the United States, has
been determined by Seller's short-term disability third-party administrator to
reasonably be expected to require long-term disability coverage, (2) in the
case of a Business Employee on short-term disability based outside of the
United States, has been determined by Seller under applicable procedures for
such determination in the local jurisdiction to reasonably be expected to
require long-term disability coverage, or (3) in the case of a Business
Employee on another approved leave, as has been set forth in the letter of
approval for such leave, who is scheduled to return to active work after the
90th day following the Closing Date, shall be effective only if and when such
employee returns to active work upon the earlier of (w) the last day of the
window provided in the applicable leave policy as in effect immediately prior
to the Closing or (x) the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date. Each
Employment Offer will include terms consistent with the terms of this Section
5.4 and applicable Law, and, with respect to each Business Employee employed
outside of the United States, structured in such manner so as to avoid any
liability under applicable Law for the payment of severance, payment in lieu
of notice or payment of other similar benefits, including, without limitation,
vacation, holiday, annual leave and sick leave, in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions. Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall be permitted
to communicate with all Business Employees, provided, however, that prior to
having direct communication with any Business Employee, Buyer will seek the
prior consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. For the period from the Closing Date until the end of
the calendar year following the year in which the Closing occurs (such period,
the "Continuation Period"), each Company Employee and each Business Employee
who accepts an Employment Offer under clauses (i) or (iii), subject to the
conditions of this Section 5.4(a), or continues employment under clause (ii)
(each, a "Transferred Employee") shall be entitled to receive (y) salary,
wages and annual short-term incentive opportunities that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the salary, wages and annual short-term
incentive opportunities that were provided to them immediately prior to the
Closing and (z) long-term incentive opportunities at the stated target rate
for such Transferred Employee's salary band immediately prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer



shall not be obligated to continue to employ any Transferred Employee for any
specific period of time following the Closing Date, subject to applicable Law.

(b)During the Continuation Period (or such longer period if required by
applicable Law), each Transferred Employee shall receive the greater of (i)
employee benefits (other than severance, but including, without limitation,
defined contribution retirement, defined benefit retirement, retiree medical
benefits, welfare and fringe benefits) that at least are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to either (A) those benefits provided to them
immediately prior to the Closing or (B) those benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates, or (ii) employee benefits
required under applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the value of any
benefits provided by Seller under any defined benefit retirement plan may be
provided by Buyer following Closing through participation in a Buyer defined
contribution retirement plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not
be obligated to continue to employ any Transferred Employee for any specific
period of time following the Closing Date, subject to applicable Law.

(c)Without limiting the scope of Sections 5.4(a) and (b), during the period
from the Closing Date until the date that is two (2) years from the Closing
Date (or such longer period if required by applicable Law), Buyer shall
provide to any Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including the Companies and their Subsidiaries), the
greater of (i) severance commensurate with levels applicable to such
Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing at Buyer's expense,
provided that no provision providing Seller or the Companies or any of the
Companies' Subsidiaries with discretion to determine whether to pay severance
or to reduce the amount of severance payable shall apply, (ii) severance
commensurate with levels applicable to similarly situated employees of Buyer
under any Buyer Benefit Plans (as defined below), or (iii) severance as
required under applicable Law.

(d)For purposes of participation of a Transferred Employee in an employee
benefit plan of Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Companies and their
Subsidiaries) (a "Buyer Benefit Plan"), each Transferred Employee shall be
credited with all years of service for which such Transferred Employee was
credited before the Closing Date under any comparable Plans, except for
purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit retirement plans, or to the
extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same
period of service, but, for the avoidance of doubt, including credit for
service for all purposes with respect to a Buyer Benefit Plan providing
retiree medical benefits, if any. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Transferred Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate without (X) any waiting time, (Y) evidence
of insurability and (Z) an actively-at-work requirement, in any and all Buyer
Benefit Plans to the extent that coverage under such Buyer Benefit Plans
replaces or continues coverage under comparable Plans in which such
Transferred Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing; and (ii)
for purposes of each Buyer Benefit Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Transferred Employee, Buyer shall
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such Buyer Benefit Plan to be waived for such Transferred Employee and his
or her covered dependents, and Buyer shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Plan ending on the date such Transferred
Employee's participation in the corresponding Buyer Benefit Plan begins to be
taken into account under such



Buyer Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Transferred Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such Buyer Benefit Plan.

(e)Buyer shall, to the extent that applicable Law does not require Seller to
cash out a Transferred Employee's paid time off, (i) credit each Transferred
Employee with an amount of paid vacation and sick leave days following the
Closing Date equal to the amount of vacation time, holiday, annual leave and
sick leave days each such Transferred Employee has accrued but not yet used or
cashed out as of the Closing Date under the Consumer Care Business's vacation,
holiday, annual leave and sick leave policies as in effect immediately prior
to the Closing Date, and (ii) allow each Transferred Employee to use such
accrued vacation, holiday, annual leave and sick leave days at such times as
each would have been allowed under the Consumer Care Business's vacation,
holiday, annual leave and sick leave policies as in effect immediately prior
to the Closing Date.

(f)Following the Closing, Buyer shall or shall cause its applicable Affiliate
to honor the terms and conditions of any Collective Bargaining Agreements in
accordance with its terms, including, without limitation, terms and conditions
relating to the compensation and benefits of Business Employees who are
covered by such agreement.

(g)Buyer shall be solely responsible for any notices required to be given
under, and otherwise comply with, the Workers Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act or similar Laws or regulations of any jurisdiction relating
to any plant closing or mass layoff (or similar triggering event) resulting
from Buyer's actions with respect to the Transferred Employees after the
Closing Date.

(h)As soon as practicable following the Closing but in any event within ninety
(90) days of the Closing Date, Seller shall pay to each Transferred Employee
who participated in an annual bonus and/or sales incentive plan immediately
prior to the Closing Date, an amount equal to such Transferred Employee's Pro
Rata Bonus (as defined below) in respect of any annual bonus and/or sales
incentive bonus for the performance period in which the Closing Date occurs.
Such Pro Rata Bonus shall be calculated by multiplying such Transferred
Employee's incentive plan target bonus opportunity by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of whole months that has elapsed between the
beginning of the performance period and the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date (including the month in which the Closing occurs), and the
denominator of which is the total number of whole months in the performance
period (the "Pro Rata Bonus"). In connection with Buyer's obligations under
Section 5.4(a), Buyer shall cause the Transferred Employees to be eligible for
a bonus under the applicable broad-based Buyer bonus plan for similarly
situated Buyer employees for the period from the Closing Date through the end
of the applicable performance period. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall
have no further obligation under any of its annual bonus and sales incentive
bonus plans for any Transferred Employee for performance periods ending after
the Closing Date.

(i)With respect to any Plan (other than a Company Plan or Plan (or portion
thereof) required to be transferred to Buyer or its applicable Affiliate under
applicable Law),



Seller or its applicable Affiliates, as the case may be, shall take any
necessary actions to cause, as of the Closing Date, Transferred Employees and
their eligible spouses, dependents, and beneficiaries who are covered under
such Plan to cease coverage under such Plan.

(j)Seller shall provide Buyer with an anonymized employee census covering each
Business Employee, other than a Company Employee, which sets forth to the
extent permissible under applicable Law: each Business Employee's employee
identification number, name (at such time as this information is necessary for
the preparation of employment offer letters), accrued vacation, sick time and
other paid time off as of the date set forth therein (the "Business Employee
Census"). Seller shall provide Buyer with human resources contact information
with respect to each country in which a Business Employee is employed and
shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in good faith for the purpose of
extending Employment Offers and preparing for the on-boarding of the
Transferred Employees, including, but not limited to, providing an updated
Business Employee Census (i) within four weeks following the date hereof, (ii)
both four weeks and two weeks prior to the date that is reasonably anticipated
to be the Closing Date and (iii) immediately prior to the Closing (updated as
of the Closing Date).

(k)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer's obligations under
this Section 5.4 shall be modified to the extent necessary to reflect
agreements or negotiations with works councils and unions or to comply with
applicable Laws of the foreign countries and political subdivisions thereof in
which such Transferred Employees are based.

(l)No Third Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Section 5.4 are for
the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i)
constitute an amendment to any of the compensation or benefits plans
maintained for or provided to Transferred Employees prior to or following the
Closing, (ii) confer upon or give to any Person, other than the parties to
this Agreement and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies with respect to the matters
provided for in this Section 5.4 under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement, (iii) prevent Buyer from amending or terminating any Company Plan
or Buyer Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms, (iv) create any third
party beneficiary rights in any individual with respect to the compensation,
terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any
Transferred Employee by Seller or a Company or under any benefit plan which
Seller or a Company may maintain or (v) confer a right to continued employment
to any individual.

5.5. Trademark Matters.

(a)Retained Ownership. Buyer acknowledges that (i) as between Seller and
Buyer, Seller exclusively owns all Retained Marks, and (ii) except as
expressly set forth in the Ancillary Documents, (A) nothing in this Agreement
or the Ancillary Documents grants Buyer or its Affiliates any right to use any
Retained Mark, and (B) as of the Closing Date, all rights of the Companies and
their Subsidiaries and the Transferred Business to use the Retained Marks
terminate and revert to Seller and its Affiliates.

(b)Corporate Names. Within fifteen (15) Business Days following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall cause each Company and its Subsidiaries to make all filings



necessary to (i) change its corporate name to a name that does not contain any
Retained Mark, (ii) withdraw all its fictitious name filings and "doing
business as" filings for any name that contains any Retained Mark, and (iii)
provide Seller with any additional information, documents and materials that
Seller may reasonably request to evidence the filings described in (i) and
(ii).

(c)Recording. Without limiting Seller's obligations under Section 12.17 and
the IP Assignment Agreement (and without expanding Seller's or its Affiliates'
obligations under the Transition Services Agreement), within eighteen (18)
months after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Companies and their Subsidiaries) to, take all steps necessary
or advisable under applicable Laws to submit for recording with the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S. Copyright Office and all other relevant
Governmental Authorities and Internet domain name registrars around the world
(i) the transfer of ownership of Registered Transferred Owned IP from the
Seller Group to Buyer, and (ii) with respect to any Registered Company Owned
IP, the change of the corporate name of each Company and its Subsidiaries
required pursuant to Section 5.5(b). No later than twenty-one (21) months
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide Seller with evidence of the
filings described in (i) and (ii).

5.6. Preservation of Books and Records.

For a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date or such longer time as may
be required by Law:

(a) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, dispose of or
destroy any of the material books and records of the Consumer Care Business
relating to periods prior to the Closing (the "Books and Records") or the Rx
Product Regulatory Documentation without first offering to provide Seller with
copies thereof by written notice to Seller at least sixty (60) days prior to
the proposed date of such disposition or destruction.

(b) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, allow Seller and its
agents access to all Books and Records and the Rx Product Regulatory
Documentation on reasonable notice and at reasonable times at Buyer's
principal place of business or at any location where any Books and Records and
the Rx Product Regulatory Documentation are stored, and Seller shall have the
right, at its own expense, to make copies of any Books and Records and the Rx
Product Regulatory Documentation; provided, that (a) Seller and its agents
shall take such action as is deemed necessary in the reasonable judgment of
Buyer to schedule such access and visits through a designated officer of Buyer
and in such a way as to avoid disrupting in any material respect the normal
operations of the Transferred Business, (b) neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to take any action to the extent that such action
would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege or would
compromise any confidential information of Buyer or its Affiliates not related
to the Transferred Business, and (c) neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
shall be required to supply Seller or its agents with any information to the
extent that doing so would violate any applicable Law or Contract (provided
that Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third party
consents that would permit the supply of such information).



(c) Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates to make available to Seller
upon reasonable notice to Seller and at reasonable times and upon written
request (i) Buyer's personnel to assist Seller in locating and obtaining any
Books and Records or the Rx Product Regulatory Documentation, and (ii) any of
Buyer's personnel whose assistance or participation is reasonably required by
Seller or any of its Affiliates in anticipation of, or preparation for,
existing or future Litigation with respect to the Transferred Business, any
audit of Seller or any of its Affiliates or other matters in which Seller or
any of its Affiliates are involved. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for Buyer's
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing the covenants
contained in this Section 5.6.

(d) Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, dispose of or
destroy any Books and Records (to the extent they do not form part of the
Transferred Consumer Care Assets) without first offering to provide Buyer with
copies thereof by written notice to Buyer at least sixty (60) days prior to
the proposed date of such disposition or destruction.

(e) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, allow Buyer and its
agents access to all Books and Records (to the extent they do not form part of
the Transferred Consumer Care Assets) on reasonable notice and at reasonable
times at Seller's principal place of business or at any location where any
such Books and Records are stored, and Buyer shall have the right, at its own
expense, to make copies of any such Books and Records; provided, that (a)
Buyer and its agents shall take such action as is deemed necessary in the
reasonable judgment of Seller to schedule such access and visits through a
designated officer of Seller and in such a way as to avoid disrupting in any
material respect the normal operations of Seller and its Affiliates, (b)
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to take any action
to the extent that such action would constitute a waiver of the attorney-
client or other privilege or would compromise any confidential information of
Seller or its Affiliates not related to the Consumer Care Business, and (c)
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to supply Buyer or
its agents with any information to the extent that doing so would violate any
applicable Law or Contract (provided that Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any third party consents that would permit the
supply of such information).

(f) Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliates to make available to Buyer
upon reasonable notice to Buyer and at reasonable times and upon written
request (i) Seller's personnel to assist Buyer in locating and obtaining any
Books and Records (to the extent they do not form part of the Transferred
Assets), and (ii) any of Seller's personnel whose assistance or participation
is reasonably required by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in anticipation of,
or preparation for, existing or future Litigation, any audit of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates or other matters in which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is
involved. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for Seller's reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in performing the covenants contained in this Section 5.6.

(g) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver a copy of each
environmental report, study, analysis and current assessment in Seller's or
its Affiliates' possession that primarily relate to the Consumer Care Business
or any Conveyed Site; provided that (i) Seller may redact any information not
related to the Consumer Care Business, and (ii) the parties and their
Affiliates shall collaborate to preserve applicable privileges and enter into
such agreements and arrangements as may be necessary or appropriate in
connection therewith.



5.7. Proprietary Information.

Prior to the Closing Date, the Consumer Care Business was routinely supplied
copies of proprietary and confidential information relating to strategic,
technical, and/or marketing plans of Seller and its Affiliates and their
various operations unrelated to the Consumer Care Business. Although Seller
has attempted to recover such information from the Consumer Care Business,
some may still be present within the Consumer Care Business. Buyer therefore
agrees that it will not use or disclose such information for any purpose
whatsoever, and shall destroy any remaining copies in its possession after the
Closing.

5.8. Ancillary Documents.

At the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Affiliates where relevant to, execute the Ancillary Documents.

5.9. Wrong Pockets.

To the extent that, during the twelve (12) months following the Closing, Buyer
or Seller discovers that any Transferred Assets:

(a)not intended to be transferred to or retained by the Companies, their
Subsidiaries or Buyer pursuant to the Contemplated Transactions were
transferred at or prior to Closing or otherwise retained (each, a "Held
Asset"), Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to (i) promptly assign
and transfer all right, title and interest in such Held Asset to Seller or its
designated assignee, and (ii) pending such transfer, (A) hold in trust such
Held Asset and provide to Seller or its designated assignee all of the
benefits associated with the ownership of the Held Asset, and (B) cause such
Held Asset to be used or retained as may be reasonably instructed by Seller.

(b)intended to be transferred to or retained by the Companies, their
Subsidiaries or Buyer pursuant to the Contemplated Transactions were not
transferred at or prior to Closing or otherwise retained (each, an "Omitted
Asset"), Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to (i) promptly assign
and transfer all right, title and interest in such Omitted Asset to Buyer or
its designated assignee, and (ii) pending such transfer, (A) hold in trust
such Omitted Asset and provide to Buyer or its designated assignee all of the
benefits associated with the ownership of the Omitted Asset, and (B) cause
such Omitted Asset to be used or retained as may be reasonably instructed by
Buyer.

To the extent permitted by applicable Law, for Tax purposes, any Held Asset
shall be considered to have never been transferred, any Omitted Asset shall be
considered to have been transferred as of the Closing, and in either case the
Allocation Schedule shall be adjusted accordingly.

5.10. Other Intellectual Property Matters.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to the terms of, and except as expressly set forth in, the Ancillary
IP Agreements, as



between Seller and Buyer, Seller has the sole and exclusive right to
prosecute, defend, settle or otherwise control any proceeding, claim or action
relating to the Seller Licensed IP, except to the extent such claim is
exclusively one between the parties to this Agreement and their Affiliates.

(b) No later than thirty (30) days prior to Closing, Seller will deliver to
Buyer (i) a list of all applicable maintenance, renewal and similar filings
that are required to be made with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the
U.S. Copyright Office and other relevant Governmental Authorities around the
world within ninety (90) days after Closing to maintain any of the Registered
Purchased Owned IP, and (ii) a list of all corporate names and trade names
that are Registered, which are included in the Registered Company Owned IP.

(c) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer hereby grants, and shall cause the
Companies and their Subsidiaries to grant, to Seller and its Affiliates a non-
exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable,
fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license, in, to and under all Shared IP,
to use the Shared IP in the operation of the Seller Businesses following the
Closing in substantially the same manner that the Shared IP was used in the
operation of the Seller Businesses prior to the Closing. The foregoing license
includes the right for Seller and its Affiliates to make, and have made on
their behalf, modifications, enhancements, derivative works and improvements
("Improvements") to the Shared IP. As between Seller and Buyer, Seller will
own all right, title and interest in and to Improvements made by or on behalf
of Seller or its Affiliates, without any duty of disclosure or accounting to
Buyer, the Companies or their Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Section
5.10(c), (i) "Shared IP" means Purchased Owned IP (other than Trademarks)
that, as of the Closing Date, was used in the Seller Businesses, and (ii)
"Seller Businesses" means the businesses of Seller and its Affiliates (other
than the Transferred Business), including the businesses associated with the
Retained Assets.

(d) Buyer acknowledges that any transfer from Seller or any of its Affiliates
to Buyer or any of its Affiliates of any of the Trademarks identified in
Section 5.10(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Embargoed Trademarks")
requires authorization from OFAC. At Buyer's request and expense and to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) within forty-five
(45) days after the date of this Agreement, submit to OFAC a request for
authorization to transfer the Embargoed Trademarks to Buyer at or after the
Closing, and (ii) obtain such authorization. In the event such authorization
is not obtained for any of the Embargoed Trademarks, after Closing, Buyer
and/or any of its Affiliates may file an application for registration of such
Embargoed Trademark in the name of Buyer, or an Affiliate of Buyer, with the
relevant Governmental Authority. At Buyer's request and expense, Seller shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, reasonably cooperate with Buyer
and/or such Affiliate of Buyer in connection with such filing, including
providing any consent reasonably necessary or useful for Buyer to make such
filing. As soon as reasonably practicable after the acceptance of such
application by such Governmental Authority, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, abandon any and all
of their respective rights in such Embargoed Trademark in the relevant
Embargoed Country.



(e) Nothing in this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents modifies any rights
Buyer or its Affiliates have or acquire independently of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents in Trademarks containing or incorporating the term
SCHERING.

5.11. Mail; Payments.

(a) Seller authorizes Buyer on and after the Closing Date to receive and open
all mail and other communications received by Buyer relating to the
Transferred Business and to deal with the contents of such communications in
good faith and in a proper manner. Seller shall promptly deliver to Buyer any
mail or other communication received by Seller after the Closing Date
pertaining to the Transferred Business.

(b) Seller agrees that Buyer has the right and authority to endorse, without
recourse, any check or other evidence of indebtedness received by Buyer in
respect of any note or account receivable transferred to Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement and Seller shall furnish Buyer such evidence of this authority
as Buyer may request.

5.12. Public Announcements.

The initial press release regarding this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions shall be made at such time and in such form as Buyer and Seller
agree, provided, that in the event that the parties cannot agree, either party
shall be permitted to make any disclosure required by Law or applicable stock
exchange rules or regulations. Prior to the Closing, none of Buyer or Seller
will issue or make any subsequent press release or public statement with
respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions without the prior
consent of Buyer and Seller, except as may be required by Law or applicable
stock exchanges rules or regulations; provided, that the party proposing to
issue any press release or similar public announcement or communication in
compliance with any such disclosure obligations shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before doing
so.

5.13. Delivery of Certain Consumer Care Financial Statements.

(a) Seller (i) shall (in the case of clauses (x) and (y)) use reasonable
efforts to deliver to Buyer within ninety (90) days of the date hereof and
(ii) in any event, (in the case of clauses (x) and (y)) shall deliver to Buyer
no fewer than twenty (20) days prior to the Closing, (x) audited special
purpose financial statements of the Consumer Care Business with respect to
calendar year 2013 and (y) back-up schedules supporting a reconciliation of
such audited financial statements to the Financial Information. Buyer shall
provide Seller ten (10) days' prior written notice requesting unaudited
special purpose financial statements of the Consumer Care Business with
respect to the most recent 3-, 6-, 9- or 12-month (as applicable) interim
period ending prior to the Closing. Seller shall use reasonable best efforts
to deliver to Buyer within the later of one hundred (100) days after Buyer's
notification or ninety (90) days after the end of the applicable 3-, 6-, 9-or
12- month interim period. The interim financial statements shall be compiled
on the basis of direct revenues and expenses, and assets acquired and
liabilities assumed for the Consumer Care Business, which statements shall
include an income statement, statement of net assets and footnotes, but which
shall not include a cash flow statement.



(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause agents and other representatives of Seller to, provide Buyer,
at Buyer's sole expense, cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer (so long as
such cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations
of Seller or any of its Affiliates or the Transferred Business) in connection
with any issuance of debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the United
States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, any bridge financing, or any other
debt financing by Buyer or any of its Affiliates; provided that (i), promptly
upon request by Seller, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all reasonable out-
of-pocket costs incurred by Seller in connection with such cooperation and
(ii) Buyer shall hold harmless Seller and its agents and other representatives
from and against any and all damages, losses, costs, liabilities or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with any such financing by
Buyer and any information used in connection therewith (other than information
provided by Seller) and all other actions taken by Seller its agents and other
representatives pursuant to this Section 5.13(b); provided, further, that,
this Section 5.13(b) shall under no circumstances obligate Seller to provide
any financial information with respect to the Transferred Business other than
(i) the Financial Information, (ii) the audited special purpose financial
statements required to be provided pursuant to Section 5.13(a) hereof, which,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, shall not be provided or
disclosed to any third party (other than in the case of any income statement
or balance sheet, and provided that nothing herein shall prohibit or limit the
right of Buyer or its Affiliates to use the audited information contained in
the special purpose financial statements to prepare pro forma financial
information that is provided or disclosed to third parties) (for the avoidance
of doubt, use of the audit opinion in the special purpose financial statements
or use of the term "audited" will require prior written consent of Seller and
its independent auditor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
and (iii) such other financial statements (including quarterly financial
statements) and other information regarding the Transferred Business, to the
extent reasonably requested by Buyer solely for the purpose of preparing
special purpose pro forma financial information of the type and form
customarily included in private placement memoranda, lender presentations and
similar materials in connection with private placements under Rule 144A of the
Securities Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall require
such cooperation to the extent it would require Seller or any of its
Affiliates to (A) pay any fees or reimburse any expenses (in each case, that
would not be reimbursed by Buyer) or give any indemnities, (B) execute any
certificate, agreement, arrangement document or instrument relating to any
such financing by Buyer, or (C) issue any offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses or similar
documents required in relation to Buyer's financing.

5.14. Intercompany Accounts.

All intercompany accounts between the Companies and their Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Companies and their
Subsidiaries), on the other hand (the "Intercompany Accounts"), shall (a) not
be Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities and (b) to the extent not settled
prior thereto, be cancelled as of the Closing.

5.15. Pharmacovigilance Obligations.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and in any event prior
to the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall execute and deliver a
pharmacovigilance agreement, in



form and substance as Buyer and Seller (acting in good faith) mutually agree
(the "Pharmacovigilance Agreement"), setting forth the responsibilities of
each party or their designees with respect to the pharmacovigilance matters
relating to the Consumer Care Products and the Rx Products in all
jurisdictions. The Pharmacovigilance Agreement shall establish procedures and
timeframes for ensuring compliance with all applicable product vigilance
requirements, including any shared reporting responsibilities) and shall
include customary terms for an agreement of that type, and in any event
including the following:

database for the Consumer Care Products and the Rx Products;

(ii) Buyer shall be permitted to perform any and all customary
pharmacovigilance-related activities (including the generation of line

(iii) Each party agrees to notify the other party of any information of which
such party becomes aware concerning any Adverse Event with respect to the
Consumer Care Products and the Rx Products whether or not determined to be
attributable to a Consumer Care Product or an Rx Product. Such notice shall be
provided in English within five (5) days after such party becomes aware of
such information where such potential Adverse Event is Serious and associated
with the clinical uses, studies, investigations, tests or marketing of a
Consumer Care Product or an Rx Product. Such notice shall be provided in
English within ten (10) calendar days after such party becomes aware of such
information for all other Adverse Events (non-Serious expected or non-Serious
Unexpected Adverse Experiences) reported to a party in connection with the
clinical uses, studies, investigations, tests or marketing of a Consumer Care
Product or an Rx Product; and

(iv) Seller or one of its Affiliates will maintain the official central global
safety database for the Polaramine Rx Products for as long as Seller or one of
its Affiliates has a Drug Approval Application for a Polaramine Rx Products
and any Consumer Care Product that contains an active pharmaceutical
ingredient (or combination thereof) for which Seller or one of its Affiliates
retains a Drug Approval Application for the prescription form of such active
pharmaceutical ingredient (or combination thereof). Seller will maintain the
official central global safety database for Consumer Care Products (excluding
any Consumer Care Product that contains an active pharmaceutical ingredient
(or combination thereof) for which Seller or one of its Affiliates retains a
Drug Approval Application for the prescription form of such active
pharmaceutical ingredient (or combination thereof)) and Rx Products until all
divestiture of the applicable product is completed in all EEA territories, at
which time, Buyer will assume responsibility. Thereafter, Seller shall be
permitted to perform any and all customary pharmacovigilance-related
activities (including the generation of line listings, search reports, license
renewals and risk management plans) with respect to products outside the EEA.
In the EEA, Seller or one of its Affiliates will report to EudraVigilance for
the Polaramine Rx Products for as long as Seller or one of its Affiliates has
a Drug Approval Application for a Polaramine Rx Product in Spain or France and
each party hereto is responsible for reporting to its respective



Governmental Authorities if required. Outside the EEA territories, for each
Consumer Care Product and Rx Product, the party who owns the applicable Drug
Approval Application is responsible for reporting to its respective
Governmental Authorities if required.

(b) To the extent that the provisions of the Pharmacovigilance Agreement are
inconsistent with or additional to the provisions of this Agreement, the
provisions of the Pharmacovigilance Agreement shall prevail.

(c) As used in Section 5.15(a), the following terms shall have the meanings
set forth below.

threatening, results in persistent and significant disability or incapacity or
requires in-patient hospitalization, or prolongation of existing

intervention to prevent one of the outcomes previously listed are also
considered serious.

"Unexpected" means a condition or development not listed in the current
labeling or investigator's brochure for a Consumer Care Product or Rx Product,

5.16. Interim Supply Agreement Addenda. As soon as practicable and in any
event within forty-five (45) days after the date hereof, Seller shall deliver
to Buyer a draft of each Addendum (as defined in the respective Interim Supply
Agreement) to each of the Interim Supply Agreements. Thereafter, Buyer and
Seller shall confer and negotiate in good faith to



agree in writing on definitive forms of each such Addendum. To the extent that
Buyer and Seller are unable to finalize a particular Addendum by the Closing
Date, then the respective supplier of the product in respect of which the
Addendum has not been agreed shall supply the respective purchaser of such
product with such product on the default terms set forth in the applicable
Interim Supply Agreement, and Buyer and Seller will continue to confer and
negotiate in good faith to expeditiously finalize such Addendum and make any

such good faith efforts, Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on a mutually
acceptable definitive Transition Services Schedule during such period, such
unresolved matters shall be referred for resolution to Buyer's and Seller's
respective senior personnel for the functional area to which the services
relate. The definitive Transition Services Agreement entered into at the

that would have been acquired by Buyer if the rights (to the extent applicable
to Consumer Care Products or Rx Products) under the Contract referred to in
Section 3.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule were a Transferred Asset,
then, to the extent permitted under the terms of such Contract, Seller shall
grant to Buyer a sublicense (containing customary terms and conditions) to
such substantially similar rights under such Contract.

ARTICLE VI

Tax Matters

6.1. Responsibility for Taxes.

The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility between
Seller and Buyer for certain Tax matters following the Closing Date:

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Buyer Indemnitee for any Losses attributable to:

(i) Taxes imposed on any Company (or imposed on any Subsidiary of any Company)
with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods;

(ii) Taxes imposed on any of the Transferred Assets with respect to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods;

(iii) Taxes imposed on any Person other than a Company (or a Subsidiary of a
Company) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which such Company (or
such Subsidiary) is liable under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations
(and any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law), as a transferee
or successor, or by contract (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes
resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections); and

(iv) Seller's failure to comply with Section 6.8(e);

provided, however, that Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnitee for any Losses attributable to (x) any Taxes accounted for as
liabilities in Closing Date Net Working Capital or Closing Date Indebtedness,
(y) Buyer Taxes, and (z) the portion of Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is
responsible under Section 6.1(c).

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Seller Indemnitee for any Losses attributable to:

(i) Taxes imposed on Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer (including any Company)
with respect to Post-Closing Tax Periods;

(ii) Taxes imposed on any of the Transferred Assets with respect to Post-
Closing Tax Periods;

(iii) Buyer Taxes; and

(iv) the portion of Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is responsible under
Section 6.1(c).



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller and
Buyer shall each be responsible for one-half of any Transfer Taxes.

(d) Seller and Buyer agree, for administrative convenience, that claims under
this Section 6.1 may not be asserted until the aggregate value of such claims
equals or exceeds $250,000, at which point such claims may be asserted (with
all future claims subject to the same $250,000 aggregate value threshold);
provided, however, that all claims outstanding on the third anniversary of
this Agreement or thereafter may be asserted even if the aggregate value of
such claims does not equal or exceed $250,000.

6.2. Apportionment of Taxes.

(a)With respect to Taxes of any Company (or of any Subsidiary of any Company)
and Taxes imposed on any of the Transferred Assets, for any Straddle Period,
(i) any Tax based on or measured by income, receipts, services or transactions
(including Income Taxes and sales, use, withholding, payroll and other
employment taxes, but not including real and personal property taxes) shall be
apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
of such Straddle Period based on an interim closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date, and (ii) any Tax not described in
clause (i) of this Section 6.2(a) shall be apportioned between a Pre-Closing
Tax Period and a Post-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period by
multiplying the total amount of such Tax by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of days in such Straddle Period up to and including the Closing
Date (in the case of the Pre-Closing Tax Period), or following the Closing
Date (in the case of the Post-Closing Tax Period), and the denominator of
which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period.

(b)To the extent permitted or required by Law, all transactions that are
properly allocable to the portion of the Closing Date after the Closing
(including transactions occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing that
are not in the ordinary course of business), shall be treated as having
occurred at the beginning of the day immediately following the Closing Date
and shall be reported on Income Tax Returns of Buyer or its Affiliates rather
than Income Tax Returns of a Merck Affiliated Group to the extent permitted or
required by Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) of the Treasury Regulations (or any
similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law).

6.3. Tax Returns.

(a)Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
when due all Tax Returns required to be filed for taxable periods of each
Company and each Subsidiary of each Company ending on or before the Closing
Date, and shall pay or cause to be paid any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns. No later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
cause each Company and each Subsidiary of each Company to furnish to Seller
Tax information relating to such Company or such Subsidiary, consistent with
the past practice and custom of Seller and such Company or such Subsidiary.
All such Tax Returns (other than Income Tax Returns of any of the Section
338(h)(10) Companies) shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with
the past practice of the Companies and their Subsidiaries, to the extent
permitted by Law.



(b)Except as provided in Section 6.3(a) and Section 6.3(e), Buyer shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed when due all Tax

any Company or any Subsidiary of any Company shall be prepared in accordance
with the past practice and custom of Seller and such Company or such
Subsidiary, to the extent permitted by Law, and shall be submitted (with
copies of any relevant schedules, work papers and other documentation then

the due date for the filing of such Tax Return and (ii) half the number of
days from the day after Closing to the due date for the filing of such Tax
Return for Seller's review and comment. If Seller provides Buyer with written
instructions at least ten (10) days prior to the due date of the Tax Return
(or at least one half the number of days between receiving the Tax Return and
the due date if less) as to the manner in which any, or all, of the items for
which it may be liable hereunder shall be reflected on such Tax Return, Buyer
shall make such changes that are consistent with the past practice and custom
of Seller, except to the extent not permitted by Law. Buyer and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute regarding such items. If Buyer
and Seller are unable to resolve any such dispute, the dispute shall be
referred to the Accounting Firm for resolution, provided that if such dispute
is not resolved prior to the due date of the Tax Return, Buyer may still file
the Tax Return and amend it if necessary when the dispute is resolved.

(d)The party required by Law to pay any property Tax on any of the Transferred
Assets for any Straddle Period shall timely file the Tax Return related to
such Tax and shall timely pay such Tax in full.

(e)The Person required by applicable Law to file any Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to any Transfer Taxes shall prepare and file such
Tax Returns and pay the Taxes shown as due thereon and Seller and Buyer shall
each, and shall each cause their Affiliates to, cooperate in the timely
preparation and filing of, and join in the execution of, any such Tax Returns
and other documentation.

(f)To the extent a party pays Taxes pursuant to this Section 6.3 for which
such party is not responsible under Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the paying party
shall provide the other party's representative (Seller or Buyer, as the case
may be), with written notice of such payment, and within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt of such written notice of payment, the non-paying party's
representative shall reimburse the paying party for the non-paying party's
share of the paid Taxes.

6.4. Tax Elections.

(a)At the request of Buyer, Seller shall join and cooperate with Buyer in
making elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and under any
comparable provisions of state or local Law) with respect to the purchase of
those Section 338(h)(10) Companies designated by Buyer (the "Section
338(h)(10) Elections"). Any such request shall be made by Buyer no later than
one hundred and fifty (150) days after the Closing Date. Buyer shall be

copies of all such forms. At the request of Buyer, Seller shall execute any
such forms.

T-0.1), as amended.

(d)At Seller's request, Buyer shall cause any of the Companies and/or any of
their Subsidiaries to make and/or join in making any Tax elections that do not
have an adverse impact on Buyer.

6.5. Cooperation on Tax Matters.

(a)Subject to Section 6.5(b), Buyer and Seller shall and shall cause their
Affiliates to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
any party, in connection with any Tax Claim and the filing of any Tax Returns.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any Tax Claim and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Seller and Buyer shall and shall cause their
Affiliates to (x) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period of any Company or
any Subsidiary of any Company until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by a Company, a Subsidiary of a
Company, or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods,
and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing
Authority, and (y) give the other reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other so requests, Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall allow the other
to take possession of such books and records.

(b)Buyer and Seller each agree, upon request, (i) to provide each other with
any information necessary to comply with Section 6043 or Section 6043A of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and (ii) to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions.

(c)No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require Seller to
provide to any Person, before, on or after the Closing Date, any right to
access or to review any



Tax Return or Tax work papers of Seller, any Merck Affiliated Group, or any
Affiliate of Seller (including any consolidated, combined, affiliated or
unitary Tax Return that includes Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, and any
pro forma Tax Return used to create any such consolidated, combined,
affiliated or unitary Tax Return).

(d)With respect to any Straddle Period Tax Return described in Section 6.3(c)
that is required to be filed within twenty (20) days after the Closing Date,
Seller shall continue until the Closing its tax preparation activities
consistent with past practice.

6.6. Tax Claims.

(a)If a claim for Taxes, including notice of a pending audit, shall be made by
any Taxing Authority, that, if successful, might result in a claim for
indemnity under Section 6.1 (any such claim, a "Tax Claim"), the party that
receives such Tax Claim shall notify the other party in writing within fifteen
(15) days of receipt of such Tax Claim; provided, that the failure to give
such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to
the extent that a party has actually been prejudiced by such failure.

(b)Seller shall control any Tax Claim with respect to a Tax Return of a Merck
Affiliated Group, and Buyer shall not participate in or control any such Tax
Claim.

(c)Except as provided in Section 6.6(b), with respect to any Tax Claim
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Company or any Subsidiary of any
Company or a Pre-Closing Tax Period relating to any Transferred Asset, Seller
shall have the right to control (or to have one or more of its Affiliates
control) the conduct of such Tax Claim unless Seller fails to provide Buyer
with written notice of their election to control such Tax Claim within ten
(10) days of Seller's receipt of notice of such Tax Claim in accordance with
Section 6.6(a); provided, however, that (i) Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably
informed as to the status of such Tax Claim and (ii) if the resolution of such
Tax Claim would reasonably be expected to have a more than de minimis adverse
effect on the Tax liability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates for any Post-
Closing Tax Period, then Buyer shall be entitled to participate in any such
Tax Claim and Seller shall not settle or otherwise compromise such Tax Claim
without Buyer's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If Seller does not elect to control a Tax Claim
pursuant to this Section 6.6(c) within the time period set forth above, then
Buyer shall control such Tax Claim; provided, however, that (A) Buyer shall
keep Seller reasonably informed as to the status of such Tax Claim and (B)
Buyer shall not settle or otherwise compromise such Tax Claim without Seller's
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(d)With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Period of any Company
or any Subsidiary of any Company or a Straddle Period relating to any
Transferred Asset, to the extent possible the Tax Items that are the subject
of such Tax Claim shall be distinguished and each party shall control the
defense and settlement of those Tax Items that relate to Taxes for which such
party is responsible under Section 6.1 and Section 6.2. If any Tax Item cannot
be identified as relating to Taxes that are the responsibility of one party or
cannot be separated from a Tax Item that relates to Taxes for which the other
party is responsible, the party that stands to gain the most (or lose the
least) from a successful defense or settlement of those Tax Items that cannot
be so attributed or separated (or both) shall control the defense and



settlement of the Tax Claim. The controlling party shall keep the other
reasonably informed as to the status of such Tax Claim and if the resolution
of such Tax Claim would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Tax liability of the non-controlling party or any of its
Affiliates, then the non-controlling party shall be entitled to participate in
the Tax Claim and the controlling party shall not settle or otherwise
compromise such Tax Claim without the non-controlling party's written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

6.7. Pre-Closing Actions Relating to Taxes.

All Tax sharing, allocation, indemnity and similar agreements between Seller,
any Merck Affiliated Group or any Affiliate of Seller, on the one hand, and
any Company or any Subsidiary of any Company, on the other hand, shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date, and neither Seller, such Merck Affiliated
Group or such Affiliate, on the one hand, nor such Company or Subsidiary, on
the other hand, shall have any obligation or liability under any such
agreement after the Closing Date.

6.8. Post-Closing Actions Relating to Taxes.

(a)Except as required by Law, Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates
not to amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or
in part to any Company or any Subsidiary of any Company with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period without Seller's prior written consent, which consent
may be withheld in Seller's sole discretion.

(b)Except as required by Law, Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates
not to carry back to any Pre-Closing Tax Period any operating losses, net
operating losses, capital losses, tax credits or similar items arising in,
resulting from, or generated in connection with a Post-Closing Tax Period.

(c)Seller shall be entitled to any Tax refunds (including any interest
included therein by the applicable Taxing Authority) of or relating to any
Company, any Subsidiary of any Company, or any Transferred Asset for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, including any Tax refunds that take the form of a credit
against the Tax liability of any Company or any Subsidiary of any Company or a
credit against a Tax liability payable with respect to any Transferred Asset.
In the case of a refund of Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, such refund
shall be equitably apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
Post-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period. If Buyer or any of its
Affiliates receives any refund to which (or to a portion of which) Seller is
entitled, Buyer shall, within five (5) days of receipt, pay, or cause to be
paid, the amount (or portion thereof) of such refund (including any interest
included therein by the Taxing Authority) to Seller.

(d)Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to take any action with
respect to any Company or any Subsidiary of any Company subsequent to the
Closing that could cause the Contemplated Transactions to constitute part of a
transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the
"Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service
Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.



(e)Seller shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, pay all Taxes due to the
government of the People's Republic of China with respect to the sale
hereunder of Schering-Plough (China) Limited.

6.9. Tax Withholding.

Provided that Seller delivers the FIRPTA Certificate to Buyer pursuant to
Section 8.11 of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer agree that, to the best of
their knowledge and belief, no Taxes or other amounts are required under
applicable Law to be deducted or withheld from any payments made by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents. If
Seller or Buyer is or becomes aware that any such deduction or withholding is
required, it shall promptly notify the other in writing of such requirement.
Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
payment made by one of them under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents
any Tax or other amount required to be deducted or withheld from such payment
under applicable Law. Provided Buyer complies with Section 6.5(b)(ii) and this
Section 6.9 with respect to such withholding obligation, any amount so
deducted or withheld and duly remitted to the applicable Governmental
Authority shall be considered for all purposes of this Agreement to have been
paid by Buyer or its Affiliate to the applicable Person in respect of which
the deduction or withholding was made.

6.10. VAT.

All amounts due under this Agreement are exclusive of VAT. If any VAT will be
chargeable, and is payable by Seller to the respective tax authority, upon
receipt of invoice in accordance with the applicable VAT laws from Seller,
Buyer shall pay or shall reimburse such VAT in addition to the sums otherwise
payable, at the rate in force at the due time for payment or such other time
as is stipulated under the relevant legislation. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize obligations relating to
VAT as a result of the Contemplated Transactions.

6.11. Survival of Obligations.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the obligations
contained in this Article VI shall survive the Closing Date until thirty (30)
days after expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period
(including extensions). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Seller
be required to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees for the same Taxes more than once
(even if Buyer Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification for such Taxes
pursuant to more than one provision contained in this Agreement).

All of the representations and warranties of the parties set forth in this
Agreement shall terminate and expire, and shall cease to be of any force or
effect, at 5:00 P.M. (Eastern time) on the date that is the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (except that, (i) the representations and
warranties in Sections 3.10(b) and (c) (Sufficiency), 3.11 (Compliance with

(a)By Buyer. From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates, and their respective officers,

and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, each Company and any Subsidiary of a Company), and their respective
officers, directors, employees, members, partners, agents, representatives,
successors and assigns (collectively, "Buyer Indemnitees") from and against
all Losses imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any of Buyer
Indemnitees arising out of or relating to: (i) the failure of any

(i) Seller shall not be required to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees: (A) with
respect to any claim for indemnification arising out of or relating to matters
described in Section 10.2(b)(i) (unless and until the aggregate Losses arising
out of or relating to matters described in Sections 10.2(b)(i) and 10.2(b)(v)
exceed $88,750,000 (the "General Deductible"), in which event Buyer
Indemnitees will be entitled to recover the General Deductible plus such
Losses as are in excess of the General Deductible; (B) with respect to any
claim for indemnification arising out of or relating to the matters described
in Section 10.2(b)(iv), unless and until the aggregate Losses arising out of
or relating to such matters exceed $25,000,000 (the "Section 2.7(d)
Liabilities Deductible"), in which event Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to
recover the Section 2.7(d) Liabilities Deductible plus such Losses as are in
excess of the Section 2.7(d) Liabilities Deductible; and (C) with respect to
any claim for indemnification arising out of or relating to matters described
in Section 10.2(b)(v) (unless and until the aggregate Losses arising out of or

Deductible"), in which event Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to recover the
Sufficiency of Assets Deductible plus such Losses as are in excess of the

Buyer Indemnitees with respect to any claim for indemnification arising out of
or relating to matters described in Section 10.2(b)(i), 10.2(b)(iv) or

$1,000,000,000 minus (ii) the aggregate amount of all claims for
indemnification by Buyer and/or its Affiliates pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any
indemnification claim or series of related claims involving Losses of less
than $250,000 shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section
10.2(b)(i), 10.2(b)(iv) or 10.2(b)(v) but shall be counted toward satisfaction
of the General Deductible, the Section 2.7(d) Liabilities Deductible or the
Sufficiency of Assets Deductible, as applicable. No Losses shall be included
in determining whether the General Deductible or the Section 2.7(d)
Liabilities Deductible has been reached unless a notice seeking
indemnification for such Losses has been given by Buyer Indemnitees to Seller
in accordance with Sections 10.2(d)(i) and 10.2(d)(ii)(A). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the limitations set forth in this clause (c)
shall not apply to any Losses arising out of or relating to the failure of any
representation or warranty made by Seller in Section 3.3(a) and (b)
(Capitalization of the Companies) or Section 3.10(a) (Title) to be true,
complete and accurate as of the Closing Date. For purposes of Sections
10.2(b)(i) and 10.2(b)(v), in determining whether a breach of a representation
or warranty hereunder has occurred or calculating the amount of Losses
indemnifiable hereunder, any materiality, Business Material Adverse Effect,
Buyer Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications in such representation
or warranty shall be disregarded.

(ii) Upon any Indemnitee becoming aware of any Loss as to which
indemnification may be sought by such Indemnitee pursuant to this Article X,
such Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such
Loss.

(iii) Any Loss for which any Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under
this Article X shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason
of the state of



facts giving rise to such Loss constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

(d)Procedure.

(i) Direct Claims. If either a Buyer Indemnitee, on the one hand, or a Seller
Indemnitee, on the other hand, (either, an"Indemnitee") shall have a claim for
indemnification hereunder for any claim other than a claim asserted by a third
party, the Indemnitee shall, as promptly as is practicable, give written
notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnitor") of
the nature and, to the extent practicable, a good faith estimate of the
amount, of the claim, which notice must certify that the Indemnitee has in
good faith already sustained some (though not necessarily all) Losses with
respect to such claim, and if the Indemnitee is asserting a claim for breach
of any of the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.12 (an
"Environmental Breach"), must be accompanied by a written report describing,
in reasonable detail, the existence of the conditions as to which an
Environmental Breach is claimed. The failure to make prompt delivery of such
written notice by the Indemnitee to the Indemnitor (so long as a notice
pursuant to this Section 10.2(d)(i), including the requisite certification, is
given before the expiration of the applicable period set forth in Section
10.1) shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any liability under this Section
10.2 with respect to such matter, except to the extent the Indemnitor is
actually prejudiced by failure to give such notice.

(ii) Third Party Actions.

(A) If an Indemnitee receives notice or otherwise obtains knowledge of any
matter or any threatened matter that may give rise to an indemnification claim
against the Indemnitor (the "Third Party Claim"), then the Indemnitee shall
promptly, and in any event within twenty (20) days of the receipt of notice or
other knowledge of any such claim against the Indemnitor, deliver to the
Indemnitor a written notice describing, to the extent practicable, such matter
in reasonable detail and such notice must be accompanied by a copy of any
written notice of the third party claimant to the Indemnitee asserting the
Third Party Claim. The failure to make prompt delivery of such written notice
or of the copy of the written notice of the third party claimant by the
Indemnitee to the Indemnitor (so long as a notice pursuant to this Section
10.2(d)(ii)(A) that includes any written notice of the third party claimant is
given before the expiration of the applicable period set forth in Section
10.1) shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any liability under this Section
10.2 with respect to such matter, except to the extent the Indemnitor is
actually prejudiced by failure to give such notice. The Indemnitee shall
deliver to the Indemnitor copies of all other notices and documents (including
court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the Third Party Claim.
The Indemnitor shall have the right, at its option, to assume the defense of
any Third Party Claim with its own counsel; provided that by assuming the
defense of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall thereby
conclusively acknowledge for all purposes of this Agreement its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnitee in respect of such matter pursuant to, but subject to
the limitations, of this Article X. Prior to the time the Indemnitee is
notified by the Indemnitor as to whether the Indemnitor will assume the
defense of such third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to timely preserve the collective rights of the parties
with respect to such Third Party Claim, including responding timely to legal
process.



(B) If the Indemnitor elects to assume the defense of any such matter, then:

(1) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Indemnitor shall not be required to pay or otherwise indemnify the Indemnitee
against any attorneys' fees or other expenses incurred on behalf of the
Indemnitee in connection with such matter following the Indemnitor's election
to assume the defense of such matter, unless (x) the Indemnitor fails to
defend diligently the action or proceeding within ten (10) days after
receiving notice of such failure from the Indemnitee, (y) the Indemnitee
reasonably shall have concluded (upon advice of its counsel) that there may be
one or more legal defenses available to such Indemnitee or other Indemnitees
that are not available to the Indemnitor, or (z) the Indemnitee reasonably
shall have concluded (upon advice of its counsel) that, with respect to such
claims, the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor may have different, conflicting, or
adverse legal positions or interests;

(2) the Indemnitee shall, at its own expense, make available to the
Indemnitor, upon request, all books, records and other documents and materials
that are under the direct or indirect control of the Indemnitee reasonably
related to the defense of such matter, and cooperate in all reasonable ways
with, and make its employees and advisors available or otherwise render
reasonable assistance to, the Indemnitor and its agents, all at the expense of
the Indemnitor; and

(3) the Indemnitor shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnitee,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, settle or
compromise any pending or threatened Third Party Claim in respect of which
indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the Indemnitee is an
actual or potential party to such Third Party Claim) or consent to the entry
of any judgment which does not, to the extent that the Indemnitee may have any
liability with respect to such Third Party Claim, include as an unconditional
term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a
written release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such
Litigation.

(C) If the Indemnitor elects not to assume the defense of and indemnification
for such matter, then the Indemnitee shall be entitled, but shall not be
obligated, to defend such matter with the assistance of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitor; provided, that the Indemnitee shall not
settle, adjust or compromise such matter, or admit any liability with respect
to such matter, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(D) The procedures in this Section 10.2(d)(ii) shall not apply to Tax Claims
(which shall be governed exclusively by Section 6.6) or to direct claims of
Seller Indemnitees or Buyer Indemnitees.

(e)Subrogation. To the extent that the Indemnitor makes or is required to make
any indemnification payment to the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor shall be
entitled to exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any rights and remedies
(including rights of indemnity, rights of contribution and other rights of
recovery) that the Indemnitee or any of the Indemnitee's Affiliates may have
against any other Person with respect to any Losses to which such
indemnification payment is directly related. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller shall



not be entitled to exercise any rights or remedies described in the
immediately preceding sentence against any customer or supplier of the
Transferred Business if the exercise of such rights or remedies would be
reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the operations and/or
conduct of the Transferred Business as it relates to any material product
thereof.

(f)Exclusive Remedies Following the Closing Date. Following the Closing Date,
and except for claims based on fraud against the party allegedly committing
the fraud, the indemnification provisions of this Article X shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Indemnitees, whether in contract, tort or
otherwise, for all matters arising under or in connection with this Agreement
and the Contemplated Transactions, including, without limitation, for any
inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
set forth herein and with respect to any matters or claims arising under
Environmental Laws, and Buyer and its successors and assigns hereby waive, and
unconditionally release Seller and its Affiliates from, any rights and
remedies that Buyer and its successors and assigns may otherwise have against
Seller or any of its Affiliates under any Environmental Law, including,
without limitation, any claims for contribution under CERCLA or common law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties shall also be entitled to all
rights and remedies under Article VI and Sections 12.15 and 12.16.

10.3. Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments.

Seller and Buyer agree to treat any payment made pursuant to Section 6.1 or
Section 10.2 as an adjustment to the Closing Consideration Amount for all Tax
purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

ARTICLE XI

Termination

11.1. Termination.

This Agreement may be terminated and the Contemplated Transactions may be
abandoned:

(a)at any time, by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

(b)at any time, by either Seller or Buyer if any Restraint having any of the
effects set forth in Section 7.1(a) of this Agreement shall be in effect and
have become final and nonappealable; or

(c)by written notice from Buyer to Seller or from Seller to Buyer, if the
Closing shall not have occurred prior to the date that is twelve (12) months
after the date hereof (the "End Date"), provided, that if on the End Date all
of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) are satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement, except for the condition in Section 7.1(b),
and this Agreement has not been previously validly terminated, then the End
Date shall be automatically extended to the date that is eighteen (18) months
after the date hereof.



11.2. Procedure and Effect of Termination.

In the event of the termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Contemplated Transactions, written notice thereof shall be given by a
terminating party to the other parties, and this Agreement shall terminate and
the Contemplated Transactions shall be abandoned without further action by any
of the parties. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1:

(a) Buyer shall promptly cause to be returned to Seller or destroy all
documents and information obtained in connection with this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions and all documents and information obtained in
connection with Buyer's investigation of the Transferred Business from Seller,
the Companies or any of their respective representatives, including any copies
made by or supplied to Buyer or any of Buyer's agents of any such documents or
information. Seller shall promptly cause to be returned to Buyer or destroy
all documents and information obtained in connection with this Agreement and
the Contemplated Transactions and Buyer's and its Affiliates' respective
businesses from Buyer or any of its representatives, including any copies made
by or supplied to Seller or any of its agents of any such documents or
information.

(b) No party hereto shall have any obligation or liability to the other
parties hereto, except that the parties hereto shall remain bound by the
provisions of this Section 11.2 and Section 5.12 and Article XII and by the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that nothing herein
shall relieve a defaulting or breaching party from any liability or damages
arising out of its breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement.

ARTICLE XII

12.3. Governing Law.

This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws (excluding conflict of laws rules and principles) of
the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed
entirely within such State, including all matters of construction, validity
and performance.

12.4. Entire Agreement.

This Agreement, including any exhibits and annexes hereto, the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, the Ancillary Documents
and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement of the
parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
Contracts or agreements, whether oral or written.

12.5. Severability.

Should any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any
Person or circumstance be held invalid or unenforceable to any extent: (a)
such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, and only to the extent, of
such unenforceability or prohibition and shall



be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by Law, (b) such unenforceability
or prohibition in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision as applied (i) to other Persons or circumstances
or (ii) in any other jurisdiction, and (c) such unenforceability or
prohibition shall not affect or invalidate any other provision of this
Agreement.

12.6. Amendment.

Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms hereof may be terminated, amended,
supplemented or modified orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed
by Buyer and Seller; provided that the observance of any provision of this
Agreement may be waived in writing by the party that will lose the benefit of
such provision as a result of such waiver.

12.7. Effect of Waiver or Consent.

No waiver or consent, express or implied, by any party to or of any breach or
default by any party in the performance by such party of its obligations
hereunder shall be deemed or construed to be a consent or waiver to or of any
other breach or default in the performance by such party of the same or any
other obligations of such party hereunder. No single or partial exercise of
any right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
any right or power, shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. Failure on the part of a party to
complain of any act of any party or to declare any party in default,
irrespective of how long such failure continues, shall not constitute a waiver
by such party of its rights hereunder until the applicable statute of
limitation period has run.

12.8. Bulk Transfer Laws.

Buyer hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
compliance by Seller and its Affiliates with the provisions of any so-called
"bulk transfer law" of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the
Transferred Assets.

12.9. Parties in Interest; Limitation on Rights of Others.

The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit
of, the parties hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors
and permitted assigns. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in
this Agreement, whether express or implied (except as set forth in Article VI
or Article X as to Persons entitled to indemnification thereunder), shall be
construed to give any Person (other than the parties hereto) any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any
covenants, conditions or provisions contained herein, as a third party
beneficiary or otherwise.

12.10. Assignability.

Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned
by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto, provided, that Buyer may assign all or any portion of its right to
purchase any shares of Company Common



Stock or any of the Transferred Assets to any Affiliate of Buyer; provided,
further, that no assignment shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations
hereunder.

12.11. Disclosure Schedules.

(c) No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an
admission or indication that such item or other matter is material (nor shall
it establish a standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever) or that
such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the
Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule. The information
set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure Schedule
is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information set
forth therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any
third party of any matter whatsoever, including any violation of Law or breach
of any Contract. The Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule and the information and disclosures contained therein are intended
only to qualify and limit the representations, warranties and covenants of
Seller and Buyer, respectively, contained in this Agreement. Nothing in the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (except Section 5.8 thereof) or the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule is intended to broaden the scope of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement or create any covenant. Matters reflected
in the Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure Schedule are not
necessarily limited to matters required by the Agreement to be reflected in
the Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure Schedule,
respectively. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes
and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. References
to any documents contained in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule are not intended to summarize or describe such documents,
but rather are for convenience only.

(d) The Seller Disclosure Schedule provided pursuant to Section 3.14, Section
3.15 and Section 3.16 shall be updated by Seller within forty-five (45) days
of the date hereof with respect to all relevant items in any jurisdiction
other than the United States, and such updated schedules shall for all
purposes of this Agreement be deemed to have been delivered as of the date
hereof; provided, however, that such updates shall not increase the aggregate
liability of Buyer under such schedules by more than 15% of the total
aggregate liability that will be assumed by Buyer as disclosed on such
schedules as of the date hereof.

12.12. Jurisdiction; Court Proceedings; Waiver of Jury Trial.

Any Litigation against any party to this Agreement arising out of or in any
way relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware or in any federal court located in the State of Delaware
and each of the parties hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts for the purpose of any such Litigation; provided, that a final judgment
in any such Litigation shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to assert (a) any
objection which it may ever have to the laying of venue of any such Litigation
in such courts, (b) any claim that any such Litigation brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and (c) any claim that such
court does not have jurisdiction with respect to such Litigation. To the
extent that service of process by mail is permitted by applicable Law, each
party irrevocably consents to the



service of process in any such Litigation in such courts by the mailing of
such process by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, at its address
for notices provided for herein. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any right to a trial by jury and agrees that any of them may file a
copy of this paragraph with any court as written evidence of the knowing,
voluntary and bargained-for agreement among the parties irrevocably to waive
its right to trial by jury in any Litigation.

12.13. No Other Duties.

The only duties and obligations of the parties under this Agreement are as
specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no other duties or obligations
shall be implied in fact, Law or equity, or under any principle of fiduciary
obligation.

12.14. Remedies.

All remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded to
the parties hereunder, except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, shall
be cumulative and not alternative, and any Person having any rights under any
provision of this Agreement will be entitled to enforce such rights
specifically, to recover damages by reason of any breach of this Agreement and
to exercise all other rights granted by Law, equity or otherwise.

12.15. Specific Performance.

The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties agree
that, in addition to any other remedies, each party shall be entitled to
enforce the terms of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy.
Each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy. Each party further agrees that the only
permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action for equitable
relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of
this Agreement.

12.16. Local Agreements.

(a) The parties hereto do not intend this Agreement to transfer title to any
Company Common Stock or Transferred Assets in any jurisdiction in which such
transfer is required to be made pursuant to a Local Agreement, and any such
Company Common Stock and Transferred Assets, as applicable, shall only be
transferred by the applicable Local Agreement. With respect to each Local
Agreement, the consideration thereunder for Company Common Stock or
Transferred Assets, as applicable, is included in and shall be payable as a
part of (and not in addition to) the purchase price hereunder.

(b) To the extent that the provisions of a Local Agreement are inconsistent
with or (except to the extent they implement a transfer in accordance with
this Agreement) additional to the provisions of this Agreement:

(i) the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail; and



(ii) so far as permissible under applicable Law of the relevant jurisdiction,
Seller and Buyer shall cause the provisions of the relevant Local Agreement to
be adjusted, to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of this
Agreement or, to the extent the foregoing is not permissible, Seller shall
indemnify Buyer against all Losses suffered by Buyer or, as the case may be,
Buyer shall indemnify Seller against all Losses suffered by Seller or any of
its Affiliates, in each case through or arising from any inconsistency between
the relevant Local Agreement and this Agreement or such additional provisions
(except to the extent they implement a transfer in accordance with this
Agreement).

(c) Each party hereto shall not, and shall cause its respective Affiliates not
to, bring any claim (including for breach of any warranty, representation,
undertaking, covenant or indemnity relating to the Contemplated Transactions)
against any other party hereto or any of its Affiliates in respect of or based
upon any of the Local Agreements, except to the extent necessary to enforce
any transfer of Company Common Stock or Transferred Assets or assumption of
Assumed Liabilities hereunder in a manner consistent with the terms of this
Agreement. All such claims (except as referred to above) shall be brought and
be subject to the provisions, rights and limitations set out in this Agreement
and no party hereto shall be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment,
reimbursement, restitution or indemnity under or pursuant to any of the Local
Agreements (but without prejudice to the establishment of the existence of the
claim hereunder).

12.17. Counterparts.

This Agreement may be executed by facsimile signatures and in any number of
counterparts with the same effect as if all signatory parties had signed the
same document. All counterparts shall be construed together and shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

12.18. Further Assurance.

If at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary or desirable
to fully effect the Contemplated Transactions, each of the parties shall take
such further action (including the execution and delivery of such further
instruments and documents) as any other party reasonably may request.
