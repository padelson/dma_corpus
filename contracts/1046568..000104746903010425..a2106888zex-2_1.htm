in accordance with, the terms of Section&nbsp;3.2(c). Any payment received by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to fractional share interests is merely intended to provide a

of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a list of each Company Benefit Plan (as hereinafter defined) maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has delivered to Parent prior to the date hereof, a true and correct copy of (1)&nbsp;such Company Benefit Plan and all
amendments thereto, (2)&nbsp;each trust agreement, insurance contract or administration agreement relating to such Company Benefit Plan, (3)&nbsp;the most recent summary plan description for each
Company Benefit Plan for which a summary plan description is required, (4)&nbsp;the most recent annual report (Form&nbsp;5500) filed with the IRS, (5)&nbsp;the most recent determination letter,
if any, issued by the IRS with respect to any Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under section&nbsp;401(a) of the Code, (6)&nbsp;any request for a determination currently pending before
the IRS and (7)&nbsp;all correspondence with the Internal Revenue Service ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>IRS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), the Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
relating to any outstanding controversy. Except as set forth on Section&nbsp;4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each Company Benefit Plan complies in all material respects with ERISA, the
Code and all other applicable statutes and governmental rules and regulations. At no time has the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates (as hereinafter defined) been required to contribute to, or
otherwise had any liability (including potential liability) with respect to, a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, a plan subject to the funding requirements of Section&nbsp;412 of the Code or a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section&nbsp;4001(a)(3) of ERISA). Except as set forth in Section&nbsp;4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, all IRS Forms 5500 with respect to the Company
Benefit Plans have been timely filed, or will be filed as provided in Section&nbsp;4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and the Company will comply with the understandings set forth therein. </FONT></P>

exemption under Section&nbsp;408 of ERISA applies. All Company Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section&nbsp;401(a) of the Code are the subject of either a favorable
determination letter issued by the IRS or operate under a prototype arrangement with respect to which the IRS issued a favorable opinion letter, and there is no reason why, to the Company's Knowledge,
any Company Benefit Plan is not so qualified in operation. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability or obligation under any welfare plan to provide life insurance or
medical benefits after termination of employment to any employee or dependent other than as required by Part&nbsp;6 of Title I of ERISA, Section&nbsp;4980B of the Code or applicable state Law. </FONT></P>
