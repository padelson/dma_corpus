ARTICLE 3 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES 

  

 3.1 _ Merger Consideration._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

  

 (a) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and unchanged following the Effective Time as shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, or any Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no stock of Parent, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 3.1, each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any shares of Company Common Stock canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(b)), shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof become and be converted into the right to receive the following (the "Per Share Merger Consideration"): (1) $6.00 in cash without interest and (2) the number (the "Exchange Ratio") of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by dividing $8.25 (the "Per Share Stock Consideration Value") by the average closing price of the Parent Common Stock as quoted on the Stock Market (as reported in the _Wall Street Journal_ , Midwest Edition) for the twenty (20) trading days (the "Average Share Value") ending on and including the trading day two (2) trading days prior to the day of the Effective Time (the "Effective Time Share Value"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of calculating the Exchange Ratio, if the Effective Time Share Value is calculated to be less than $44.00 but greater than or equal to $37.00, then the Per Share Stock Consideration Value will be reduced by $0.10 per dollar below $44.00, subject to proportionate adjustment for fractions of a dollar, and if the Effective Time Share Value is calculated to be more than $58.00 but less than or equal to $65.00, then the Per Share Stock Consideration Value will be increased by $0.10 per dollar above $58.00, subject to proportionate adjustment for fractions of a dollar; _provided_ ,  _however_ , subject to the provisions of Section 8.1(c)(2) and 8.1(d)(6) hereof, notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of calculating the Exchange Ratio, if the Effective Time Share Value is less than $37.00, the Exchange Ratio shall be fixed at 0.204 and if the Effective Time Share Value is more than $65.00, the Exchange Ratio shall be fixed at 0.138 (collectively, the "Collar"). No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued, and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to Section 3.2(e). For purposes of this Agreement, all calculations made with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be rounded to the nearest one thousandth of a share. 

  

 (d) At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, Stockholders, other than to receive any dividend or other distribution with respect to such Company Common Stock with a record date occurring on or before the Effective Time (permitted under Section 6.1 hereof) and the consideration provided under this _Article 3_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock. 

  

 (e) If, during or after determination of the Exchange Ratio but prior to or simultaneously with the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares, by reason of any reclassification, stock dividend, stock split or combination of shares (or if during such period a record date with respect to any of the foregoing should occur), the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such reclassification, stock dividend, stock split or combination of shares. 

  

    
 

  

 3.2 _ Exchange of Certificates._ 

  

  

 (a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Computershare Trust Company of New York, or such other bank or trust company designated by the Company and who is reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the "Exchange/Paying Agent") for the benefit of the holders of certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Stock Certificates") for exchange and payment in accordance with this _Article 3_, through the Exchange/Paying Agent, (1) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock ("Parent Stock Certificates"), (2) cash, equal to the amount payable to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1 and the amount payable to holders of Existing Options to acquire Company Stock pursuant to Section 3.4 and (3) an estimated amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares (such cash and such Parent Stock Certificates, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto (without any interest thereon), being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange/Payment Fund") to be paid pursuant to this _Article 3_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The Exchange/Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange/Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange/Payment Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that all such investments shall be in (1) obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America having a maturity of three (3) months or less, (2) commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moody\'s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation or (3) certificates of deposit of federally insured commercial banks with capital exceeding $1.0 billion having a maturity of three (3) months or less. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. Any losses resulting from such investments shall be the sole responsibility of Parent and shall not in any way limit Parent\'s obligations to holders of Company Stock Certificates. 

  

 (b) Prior to or upon the Effective Time, Parent will instruct the Exchange/Paying Agent to mail as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) business days after the Exchange/Paying Agent receives an electronic copy of the Company\'s stock records as of the Effective Time, suitable for the Exchange/Paying Agent\'s use, from the Company\'s transfer agent, to each holder of record of Company Stock Certificates who has not previously surrendered his or her Company Stock Certificates (other than holders of any shares of Company Common Stock cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(b)): (1) a letter of transmittal reasonably acceptable to the Company (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such holder\'s Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange/Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as to which Parent and the Company may agree) and (2) instructions reasonably acceptable to the Company for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Stock Certificates in exchange for Parent Stock Certificates and cash in accordance with Section 3.1 (collectively, the "Letter of Transmittal"). 

  

 (c) Upon the later of the Effective Time and the surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for cancellation (or the affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificates reasonably acceptable to Parent) to the Exchange/Paying Agent together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant thereto, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Exchange/Paying Agent shall deliver in accordance with the Letter of Transmittal: (1) Parent Stock Certificates representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with Section 3.1, (2) cash which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with Section 3.1 and (3) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(e) (the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash 

  

    
  

 described in clauses (1), (2) and (3) being collectively referred to as the
"Merger Consideration"), and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares
of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a certificate evidencing the proper number of shares of Parent
Common Stock and/or cash may be issued and/or paid in accordance with this
_Article 3_ to a transferee if the Company Stock Certificate evidencing such
shares is presented to the Exchange/Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
reasonably acceptable to the Exchange/Paying Agent that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 3.2, each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration together with any dividends or other
distributions declared or paid on shares of Parent Common Stock after the
Effective Time.

  

 (d) All shares of Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Company Stock Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article 3_ shall be deemed to have been issued and paid, respectively, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Company Stock Certificates. 

  

 (e) Subject to this Section 3.2(e), no certificates or scrip evidencing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Stock Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock, upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for exchange pursuant to this Section 3.2, shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest), rounded up to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying (1) the Effective Time Share Value by (2) the fractional interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held of record by such holder). The Exchange/Paying Agent shall promptly pay such amounts to such holders of Company Stock Certificates subject to, and in accordance with, the terms of Section 3.2(c). Any payment received by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to fractional share interests is merely intended to provide a mechanical rounding off of, and is not separately bargained for, consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if more than one Company Stock Certificate shall be surrendered for the account of the same holder, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to such holder in exchange for the Company Stock Certificates which have been surrendered shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares represented by all of the Company Stock Certificates surrendered for the account of such holder. 

   

 (f) Any portion of the Exchange/Payment Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Company Stock Certificates for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Exchange/Paying Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this _Article 3_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (g) None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the Exchange/Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock or cash from the Exchange/Payment Fund in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Company Stock Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to seven (7) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration and any cash payable to the holder of such Company Stock Certificate pursuant to Section 3.2(e) would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

    
 

   

   

  

 (h) Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Existing Options of the Company such amounts as Parent or Merger Sub is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or Merger Sub, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or Existing Options of the Company in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or Merger Sub. 

  

 (i) If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of a customary affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Exchange/Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration, pursuant to this _Article 3_. 

  

 (j) In the event this Agreement is terminated without the occurrence of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Exchange/Paying Agent to, return promptly, but, in any event, within three (3) business days after such termination, any Company Stock Certificates theretofore submitted or delivered to the Exchange/Paying Agent, without charge to the Person who submitted such Company Stock Certificates. 

  

  

 3.3 _ Stock Transfer Books._ After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange/Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article 3_,  except as otherwise required by Law. 

  

 3.4 _ Existing Options of the Company._ 

  

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions necessary under and legally permissible in accordance with the terms of the 1996 Plan and the Pfenniger Option (and use its commercially reasonable efforts with respect to the 1986 Plan and 1992 Plan), including without limitation, satisfying any applicable notice requirements, so that each Existing Option to purchase Company Common Stock granted by the Company which is outstanding at the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled effective at and as of the Effective Time, without any payment therefor except as otherwise provided for herein. In consideration for the cancellation of each Existing Option to purchase Company Common Stock, the holder of each such Existing Option to purchase Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive from Parent, promptly after the Closing, cash equal to the product of (1) the positive difference, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration, expressed in terms of cash (with the portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in Parent Common Stock being first determined in accordance with Section 3.1(c) including the Collar, but then valued at the actual Effective Time Share Value, without regard to the Collar) less the exercise price of each such Existing Option, multiplied by (2) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock (whether vested or unvested) covered by such Existing Option to purchase Company Common Stock (the "Per Option Merger Consideration"), net of any withholding obligations; _provided, however_ , that prior to payment of the Per Option Merger Consideration to a holder of an Existing Option to purchase Company Common Stock, such holder must have (i) delivered such Existing Option to Purchase Company Common Stock (or a duly executed affidavit of loss in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent) and (ii) duly authorized, executed and delivered to the Exchange/Paying Agent an acknowledgment of cancellation and termination or such other document necessary, or customarily required, in a form 

  

    

 which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, indicating
such holder\'s acknowledgment that, except for such holder\'s rights to
receive the consideration set forth in this Section 3.4(a), any and all
claims with respect to any Existing Option to purchase Company Common Stock
shall be fully released and terminated (the "Option Cancellation and
Termination Acknowledgment"). Prior to or upon the Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Exchange/Paying Agent to mail as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5)
business days after the Exchange/Paying Agent receives an electronic copy of
the Company\'s option records as of the Effective Time, suitable for the
Exchange/Paying Agent\'s use, to each Existing Option holder who has not
previously exercised his or her Existing Option to purchase Company Common
Stock: (1) a letter of transmittal reasonably acceptable to the Company
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected only upon proper delivery
of (i) the Existing Option to purchase Company Common Stock (or a
duly executed affidavit of loss in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent)
and (ii) the duly executed Option Cancellation and Termination
Acknowledgement, to the Exchange/Paying Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as to which Parent and the Company may agree) and
(2) instructions reasonably acceptable to the Company for use in effecting the
surrender, cancellation and termination of the Existing Option to purchase
Company Common Stock in exchange for cash in accordance with this Section
3.4(a).

  

 (b) As of the Effective Time, all Company Option Plans shall terminate and all rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be cancelled. At and after the Effective Time, no Person shall have any right under the Company Option Plans or any other plan, program or arrangement with respect to equity securities of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries (other than as set forth in Section 3.4(a) above). Without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Existing Options to purchase Company Common Stock to receive the consideration set forth in Section 3.4(a) above, the Company shall take all such actions necessary under the 1996 Plan and the Pfenniger Option (and use its commercially reasonable efforts with respect to the 1986 Plan and 1992 Plan) to terminate each such Company Option Plan with respect to Existing Options as of the Effective Time.

 4.15 _ Employee Benefits._ 

  

  

 (a) Section 4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a list of each Company Benefit Plan (as hereinafter defined) maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has delivered to Parent prior to the date hereof, a true and correct copy of (1) such Company Benefit Plan and all amendments thereto, (2) each trust agreement, insurance contract or administration agreement relating to such Company Benefit Plan, (3) the most recent summary plan description for each Company Benefit Plan for which a summary plan description is required, (4) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS, (5) the most recent determination letter, if any, issued by the IRS with respect to any Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, (6) any request for a determination currently pending before the IRS and (7) all correspondence with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), the Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation relating to any outstanding controversy.

All Company Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code are the subject of either a favorable determination letter issued by the IRS or operate under a prototype arrangement with respect to which the IRS issued a favorable opinion letter, and there is no reason why, to the Company\'s Knowledge, any Company Benefit Plan is not so qualified in operation. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability or obligation under any welfare plan to provide life insurance or medical benefits after termination of employment to any employee or dependent other than as required by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, Section 4980B of the Code or applicable state Law.

other arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries with or relating to its
employees which contain change of control or similar provisions. The Company

such plan is designed so that the limit described in Code Section 280G of the
Code will not apply to payment made under the plan.

  

 (e) The Company has complied in all material respects with all of its obligations under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), and will not incur any material liability in connection with benefit continuation rights under COBRA with respect to its employees or former employees or any other employees.

 6.10 _ Additional Reports._ In accordance with Section 6.3, the Company and Parent shall each furnish to the other copies of any Company SEC Documents or Parent SEC Documents, as the case may be, which it files with the SEC on or after the date hereof, and the Company and Parent, as the case may be, represents and warrants that as of the respective dates thereof, such reports will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Any unaudited consolidated interim financial statements included in such reports (including any related notes and schedules) will fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, as of the dates thereof and the results of operations and changes in financial position or other information included therein for the periods or as of the dates then ended, in each case in accordance with such Party\'s past practice and GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved (except as otherwise disclosed in the notes thereto and subject, where appropriate, to normal year-end adjustments).

 6.12 _ Regulatory and Other Approvals._ 

  

  

 (a) The Company and Parent will (1) take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to file as soon as practicable, notifications under the HSR Act and the other Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger, (2) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request for additional information received from the Federal Trade Commission or Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR Act or from any other Governmental Entity pursuant to the other Antitrust Laws, and (3) request early termination of all applicable waiting periods. 

  

 (b) The Company and Parent will take all commercially reasonable steps necessary, and proceed diligently and in good faith and use all commercially reasonable efforts, as promptly as practicable to (1) solicit input from Governmental Entities and Educational Agencies regarding the process of obtaining Educational Agency and DOE approvals of the Merger, obtain all Educational Agency and DOE approvals of the Merger, make all filings with and give all notices to Governmental Entities and Accrediting Bodies, (2) provide such other information and communications to such Governmental Entities and Accrediting Bodies or other persons as such Governmental Entities and Accrediting Bodies may request and (3) obtain all Educational Agency and DOE approvals of the Merger, make all filings with and give all notices to Governmental Entities and Accrediting Bodies and obtaining all licenses required to consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party will promptly and regularly advise the other Parties concerning the occurrence and status of any material discussions or other communications, whether oral or written, with any Educational Agency, other Governmental Entity or other third party with respect to any Educational Approval or other regulatory approval which must be obtained either prior to or after Closing in order for Parent and Merger Sub to operate the Schools and to participate in any Student Financial Assistance Programs, including the Title IV Programs (the "Consents"), including any difficulties or delays experienced in obtaining any Consent and of any conditions proposed, considered, or requested for any Consent. Parent will cooperate with the Company, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent, in their respective efforts to obtain any Consents, but neither party will be required (1) to make any expenditure or payment of funds or to give any other consideration in order to obtain any Consent other than fees or expenses incident to any applications as filings with respect thereto, or (2) to permit any adverse and unduly burdensome changes in, or the imposition of any adverse and unduly burdensome condition to, any Educational Approval as a condition to obtaining any Consent. Parent may contact any Educational Agency or Governmental Entity of the Company with respect to the proposed Merger after seven (7) business days after the date hereof, in order to allow the Company to inform its regulators of the proposed Merger, _provided, however,_ that Parent shall make such contacts for the sole purpose of facilitating its receipt of any Consents. After that date, the Company and Parent will provide advance notice to allow the other Party and its agents and representatives to participate in any meetings or telephone calls initiated by such Party with any Educational Agency or Governmental Entity with regard to any Consent with respect to which the parties are experiencing any significant difficulty or delay in obtaining. Each Party will promptly advise the other of any telephone calls initiated by any Educational Agency or Governmental Entity with respect to any such Consent. The Company and Parent will submit to the other Party for prior review each filing proposed to be submitted to any Educational Agency or Governmental Entity regarding the proposed Merger; _provided, however,_ if the other Party does not respond to the Party requesting review of the filing within three (3) business days, the Party requesting such review may presume that the other Party has approved and may proceed to submit such filing. The Company and Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that their respective appropriate officers and employees shall be available to attend, as any Governmental Entity may reasonably request, any scheduled hearings or meetings in connection with obtaining any Consent. 

  

    
  

 (c) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, the Company and Parent will take all commercially reasonable steps necessary or desirable, and proceed diligently and in good faith and use all reasonable efforts to obtain all approvals required by any contract to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (d) The Company and Parent shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the Antitrust Laws, but neither Party will be required (1) to make any expenditure or payment of funds or to give any other consideration in order to resolve any such objections other than fees or expenses incident to any applications as filings with respect thereto, or (2) to permit any adverse and unduly burdensome changes in, or the imposition of any adverse and unduly burdensome condition to resolving any such objections. In connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened in writing to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, and, if by mutual agreement, Parent and the Company decide that litigation is in their best interests, each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use all commercially reasonable efforts vigorously to contest and resist any such action or proceedings and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of any such transaction. Each of Parent and the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the date of this Agreement. The obligations of Parent under this Section 6.12 with respect to the Antitrust Laws shall not require Parent to obtain or attempt to obtain any such waiver, permit, consent, approval or authorization if obtaining such waiver, permit, consent, approval or authorization would require disposition of any assets of Parent. 

  

  

 6.13 _ No Solicitation._ 

  

  

 (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, the Company will not, and will not permit its directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other representatives, agents or Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (1) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage any Acquisition Proposals or any inquiries or proposals that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposals, (2) engage in negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any non-public information to any person or entity in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal or (3) agree to, approve, recommend or otherwise endorse or support any Acquisition Proposal. As used herein, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any proposal relating to a possible (1) merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (2) sale, lease or other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise, of any assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, ten percent (10%) or more of the assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, (3) issuance, sale or other disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase or securities convertible into, such securities) representing ten percent (10%) or more of the votes attached to the outstanding securities of the Company, (4) transaction with the Company in which any person shall acquire beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or any "group" (as such term is defined under the Exchange Act) shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, ten percent (10%) or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (5) liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other similar type of transaction with respect to the Company, or (6) transaction which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions; _provided, however,_ that the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall not include the Merger and the 

  

    

 transactions contemplated hereby or any proposal or modification thereof
submitted by Parent or any of its Affiliates. The Company will, and will
direct all its directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other representatives, agents and Affiliates to, immediately
cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.13(a) above, if a corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, partnership, person or other entity or group other than Parent or any of its Affiliates (a "Third Party") after the date of this Agreement submits to the Company or its Board of Directors, not resulting from a breach of Section 6.13(a) above, an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal, and the Company\'s Board of Directors reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel (which may include its regularly engaged outside counsel) and any nationally recognized investment bank (which may include the Financial Advisor), that such Acquisition Proposal will result in, or upon further discussion with or due diligence by such Third Party could reasonably be expected to constitute or result in, a Superior Proposal (as defined below), then, in such case (1) the Company may (A) furnish information about its business, to the Third Party under protection of an appropriate confidentiality agreement on substantially the same terms as the Confidentiality Agreements containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all non-public written or oral information furnished to such Third Party, provided that the Company contemporaneously furnishes to Parent all such non-public information furnished to the Third Party and (B) negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations with such Third Party and (2) if the Company\'s Board of Directors determines that such an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, the Company\'s Board of Directors may (but subject in all events to the Company\'s obligation to hold the Special Meeting and allow the Stockholders to vote on the Merger) withdraw or adversely modify its recommendation of the Merger. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal for consideration consisting of cash (not subject to a financing contingency) and/or securities, and otherwise on terms which the Company\'s Board of Directors determines (based on the written advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, including, without limitation, the Financial Advisor) are more favorable to the Stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger (or other revised proposal submitted by Parent as contemplated above), after consultation with its outside legal counsel (which may be its regularly engaged outside legal counsel) and that the Third Party is reasonably likely to consummate the Superior Proposal on substantially the terms proposed. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Company from taking, and disclosing to its shareholders, a position required by Rule 14d-9(e) under the Exchange Act. 

  

 (c) The Company will notify Parent immediately, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, if (1) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal is made or is modified in any respect (including any written material provided by the offeror the principal terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or modification thereto and the identity of the offeror) or (2) the Company furnishes non-public information to, or enters into discussions or negotiations with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with, any Third Party. 

  

 (d) In addition to the obligations of Company set forth in paragraph (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 6.13, Company, as promptly as practicable, will advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for information which Company reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects of the status of any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. In addition to the foregoing, the Company will provide Parent with prior or reasonably contemporaneous telephonic (promptly confirmed in writing) or written notice of any meeting of the Company\'s Board of Directors (or 

  

    
  

 any committee thereof) at which the Company\'s Board of Directors is
expected or could reasonably be expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal,
together with a copy of the definitive documentation relating to such
Acquisition Proposal to the extent such documentation is then available (and
otherwise provide such definitive documentation as soon as available).

   

 (e) It is understood and agreed that, without limitation of the Company\'s obligations hereunder, any violation of this Section 6.13 by any director, officer, Affiliate, investment bank, financial advisor, accountant, attorney or other advisor or representative of the Company, whether or not such person or entity is purporting to act on behalf of the Company, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.13 by the Company. 

  

  

 6.14 _ Public Announcements._ Any public announcement made by or on behalf of either Parent or the Company prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 8 _hereof concerning this Agreement, the transactions described herein or any other aspect of the dealings heretofore had or hereafter to be had between the Company and Parent and their respective Affiliates must first be approved by the other party (any such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), subject to either party\'s obligations under applicable Law or Stock Market or AMEX listing requirements or rules (but such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party as to all such public announcements). 

  

 6.15 _ Expenses._ 

  

  

 (a) Except as set forth in this Section 6.15 and Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

  

 (b) The Company and Parent each agree to pay one-half (1/2) of any printing, mailing and filing expenses of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and pre-merger notification and report forms under the HSR Act. 

  

 (c) In connection with any claim, dispute, disagreement or other conflict involving the enforcement of this _Article 6_ or Section 8.3, the parties agree that the prevailing party shall be reimbursed by the other party for all reasonable attorneys\' fees and costs and expenses associated with such conflict. 

  

  

 6.16 _ Certain Benefit Plans._ 

  

  

 (a) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Company\'s Board of Directors shall adopt resolutions to discontinue (for any applicable period that has not yet commenced) the distribution of Company Common Stock to any Company Benefit Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code and to discontinue the purchase of Company Common Stock under the Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company\'s Board of Directors shall adopt a resolution freezing and terminating each Company Benefit Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement subject to Section 401(k) of the Code. The Company shall provide written resolutions reasonably satisfactory to Parent authorizing the foregoing. A copy of such resolutions shall be delivered to Parent prior to the Closing Date. As soon as practical after the Closing, Parent may cause the Surviving Corporation to file the terminated Company Benefit Plans with the IRS for favorable determination letters and the Surviving Corporation shall take such other steps as it deems necessary in its sole discretion with respect to the terminated Company Benefit Plans. In connection with such terminations, the Company is authorized and directed to make, prior to the Closing Date, any matching contributions to any such 401(k) Plan in the amount or percentage required or customarily awarded under the plan for the plan year of the Closing Date and the previous plan year. 

  

 (b) From and after the date that active employees of the Company who are covered under any Company Benefit Plan cease to be covered under such Plan (herein called the "Continuing 

  

    
  

Employees"), Parent shall cause all Continuing Employees to be eligible to
participate in all applicable employee benefit plans in which similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries participate (called "Parent
Plans"), under the terms and conditions of the applicable Parent Plans, except
as provided herein. For purposes of any length of service requirement,
waiting periods, vesting periods or different benefits based on length of
service in any Parent Plans for which a Continuing Employee will be
eligible, the Parent shall ensure that service by such Continuing Employee
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to have been
service with the Parent or its Subsidiaries. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any right with respect to
continued employment with the Parent.

  

 (c) Parent shall cause each applicable Parent Plan to grant credit to each Continuing Employee for all service on or prior to the Closing Date with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual, benefit calculations or allowances (including, without limitation, entitlements to vacation, severance, sick days and other paid leave). 

  

  

 6.17 _ Indemnification._ 

  

  

 (a) The Company shall, and from and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall, indemnify, defend and hold harmless (and advance expenses to) each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company (each individually an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") to the same extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to any agreements between such person and the Company and the Company\'s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) as a result of or in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether criminal, civil or administrative, based on or arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or out of or in connection with activities in such capacity, whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time ("Indemnified Liabilities"), including all Indemnified Liabilities based on, or arising out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, in the event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any Indemnified Parties (whether arising before or after the Effective Time) and, in the written opinion of counsel to an Indemnified Party, under applicable standards of professional conduct, there may be a conflict of interest between the position of the Company or Parent, as applicable, and an Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company (or Parent after the Effective Time), and the Company shall (or after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefore are received, provided, however that (1) the Company and the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (2) neither Parent, the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without Parent\'s prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.17, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify both Parent and the Company (or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) (but the failure to so notify shall not relieve a party from any liability which it may have under this Section 6.17 except and only to the extent such failure materially prejudices such party). An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to the indemnification rights provided for in this Section 6.17 with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation against the Company brought by the 

  

    

 Indemnified Party (other than a claim against the Company for
indemnification for matters brought by a party other than the Indemnified
Party and wrongfully denied by the Company).

  

 (b) This Section 6.17 shall survive the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time, is intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties. 

   

 (c) For a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies from a financially capable insurer of at least the same coverage and amount containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less advantageous, or in the event such coverage is provided through Parent\'s insurer it may be on terms and conditions (other than coverage and amounts) consistent with Parent\'s current coverage), or in lieu thereof obtain single limit tail coverage for such period (which shall be purchased by the Company immediately prior to Closing upon the request of Parent), with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred before the Effective Time. 

  

  

 6.18 _ Takeover Law._ Neither the Company, Parent nor Merger Sub shall take any action that would cause the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement to be subject to the requirements of any Takeover Law. If any Takeover Law shall become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement, each of the Company and Parent and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement, and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Law on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement. 

  

 6.19 _ Notification of Certain Matters._ Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent will promptly notify the other in writing if such Party becomes aware of any development, fact or condition that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or with other existing developments, facts or conditions, to result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to such Party, or (b) causes or constitutes a breach of any agreement or covenant under this Agreement applicable to such Party, or of such Party\'s representations and warranties as of the date of this Agreement, or if such Party becomes aware of the occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any fact or condition that would cause or constitute a breach of any such representation or warranty had such representation or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or condition. No such notice will constitute a cure of any such breach. 

  

 6.20 _ Disclosure Letter Supplements._ From time to time prior to the Effective Time, each Party hereto will promptly supplement, update or modify (by written notice to the other) its respective Disclosure Letters delivered pursuant hereto with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such Disclosure Letter or which is necessary to correct any information in such Disclosure Letter which has been rendered inaccurate thereby. For the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article 7 and subject to Sections 7.2(a) and 7.3(a), no effect will be given to any supplement, update or modification of the respective Disclosure Letters made or purported to be made pursuant to this Section 6.20. No such supplement, update or modification to the respective Disclosure Letter will constitute a cure of any breach of any agreement, representation or covenant under this Agreement. 

     

 6.21 _ Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment._ The Parties shall use their best efforts to cause the Merger to be treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and shall not knowingly take or fail to take any action which action or failure to act would jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Parties shall execute and deliver to counsel to each of the Parties such representation letters as may be reasonably requested by such law firms in connection with their delivery of opinions with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 6.22 _ Exemption from Liability under Section 16(b)._ 

  

  

 (a) Provided that Company delivers to Parent the Section 16 Information (as defined below) with respect to Company prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), will adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective Time providing that the receipt by Company Insiders of Parent Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. 

  

 (b) "Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all respects regarding Company Insiders, the number of shares of Company Common Stock or other Company equity securities deemed to be beneficially owned by each Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger. 

  

 (c) "Company Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act who are listed in the Section 16 Information. 

  

  

 6.23 _ Real Estate Deliveries._ The Company shall use its good faith efforts in cooperating with Parent in obtaining the following, in forms reasonably requested by Parent, with respect to each of the Leases; provided, however, the Company shall not be required to unreasonably burden its business operations in so cooperating: (a) an estoppel, consent and amendment agreement from each of the landlords, joined by the tenant thereof, and (b) a subordination, nondisturbance and attornment agreement from each mortgagee or trustee under a deed of trust or underlying or ground lessor. 

  

 6.24 _ Reasonable Efforts._ So long as this Agreement has not been terminated, the Company, the Parent and Merger Sub shall: (a) promptly make their respective filings (including, without limitation, filings required pursuant to the Securities Act and the Exchange Act), obtain waivers, consents, permits and approvals, and thereafter make any other submissions required under all applicable Laws in order to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (b) use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or appropriate to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 6.25 _ Affiliate Agreements._ 

  

  

 (a) Not later than the fifteenth (15th) day prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Company shall deliver to Parent a schedule of each Stockholder that is or is reasonably likely to be, as of such date, deemed to be an Affiliate of the Company and who was not previously disclosed pursuant to Section 4.36 or for whom the Company has not delivered an Affiliate Letter pursuant to Section 4.36. 

  

 (b) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Stockholder referred to in Section 6.25(a) who may be deemed to be an Affiliate of the Company, to execute and deliver to the Parent on or before the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus an Affiliate Letter. 

  

    
 

  

 6.26 _ No Rights Triggered._ Each of the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that the entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and any other action or combination of actions, or any other transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any Person under the Parent Rights Plan or under any agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. 

  

 6.27 _ Shareholder Litigation._ The Parties shall cooperate and consult with one another, to the fullest extent possible, in connection with any stockholder litigation against any of them or any of their respective directors or officers with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of and without in any way limiting the foregoing, each of the Parties shall use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to prevail in such litigation so as to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the manner contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not compromise or settle any litigation commenced against it or its directors or officers relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) without Parent\'s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 (f) The Company shall have received an opinion from Stearns Weaver Miller Weissler Alhadeff and Sitterson, P.A., dated the Closing Date, based upon factual representations of Parent and the Company, to the effect that the Merger will constitute a reorganization for federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and no gain or loss will be recognized by the Company or its Stockholders as a result of receipt of the Merger Consideration, other than gain with respect to the receipt of the cash portion of the Merger Consideration; _provided, however,_ that if Stearns Weaver Miller Weissler Alhadeff and Sitterson, P.A. does not

 (h) All actions to be taken by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and all certificates, opinions, instruments and other documents required to effect the transactions contemplated hereby shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Company and its counsel. 

  

  

 7.3 _ Conditions to Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s Obligation to Effect the Merger._ The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate and effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are further subject to the fulfillment of the following conditions, any of which may be waived only in writing in whole or part by Parent or Merger Sub: 

  

  

 (a) Except for the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 4.19, Sections 4.20(b), (e) and (f)(2) and Section 4.21(b) that are qualified by reference to the Company\'s Knowledge and "Material Adverse Impact" (i) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement that are qualified by materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" shall have been true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and shall be true and correct as of the Effective Time as if made on and as of the Effective Time, and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement that are not so qualified shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the Effective Time as if made on and as of the Effective Time except for those representations and warranties which address matters only as of a particular date (which shall remain true and correct as of such date).

 (b) The Company shall have in all material respects performed all obligations and complied in all material respects with all covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it at or prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, there shall not have been any event or development which results in a Material Adverse Effect upon the business of the Company. 

  

    
 

   

   

  

 (d) The Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate, dated the Closing Date and signed by its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, certifying the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.3(a), (b) and (c). 

   

 (e) Parent shall have received all written consents, approvals, interim approvals, assignments, waivers, orders, authorizations or other certificates reasonably necessary to provide for the continuation in full force and effect of those Material Contracts set forth on Section 7.3(e) of the Parent Disclosure Letter and all of the Existing Permits of the Company and for the Company to consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the approval of applicable Educational Agencies, Accrediting Bodies and Governmental Entities, except (1) approval from the DOE, (2) approval from any Educational Agency that, under the agency\'s policies or standards, cannot be obtained or, due to administrative preference, may be obtained solely in interim form prior to Closing or (3) where the failure to receive such consents, approvals, interim approvals, assignments, waivers, orders, authorizations or certificates could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or could not affect adversely the ability of the Surviving Corporation to continue to conduct the business of the Company consistent with the Company\'s historical ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent that Parent receives an interim approval from any applicable Educational Agency or Accrediting Body, such interim approval will not satisfy this condition to closing if such interim approval is issued because there is some substantive issue with respect to issuance of full approval as opposed to being issued because it is such Educational Agency\'s or Accrediting Body\'s normal practice or procedure or administrative preference. Parent shall have received written or oral assurances from the Georgia Nonpublic Postsecondary Education Commission, the Accrediting Bureau Of Health Education Schools, the Missouri Coordinating Board for Higher Education, the Pennsylvania State Board of Private Licensed Schools, and the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, confirming that such Educational Agency does not believe that any impediment exists with respect to issuance of the Educational Approvals which Parent requires for its operation of the Company\'s Schools after the Closing. 

  

 (f) Parent shall have received an opinion from Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman dated the Closing Date, based upon factual representations of Parent and the Company, to the effect that the Merger will constitute a "reorganization" for federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and no gain or loss will be recognized by Parent or its stockholders as a result of the Merger; _provided, however_ , that if Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman does not render such opinion, this condition shall nonetheless be deemed to be satisfied with respect to the Parent if Stearns Weaver Miller Weissler Alhadeff and Sitterson, P.A. renders such opinion to Parent. 

  

 (g) All actions to be taken by the Company in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and all certificates, opinions, instruments and other documents required to effect the transactions contemplated hereby shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Parent and its counsel. 

  

 (h) Parent shall have obtained a written statement from DOE providing, without unduly burdensome limitations, that DOE does not see any impediment to issuing a Temporary Program Participation Agreement with respect to each Institution following the Closing. 

  

 (i) All consents, approvals, interim approvals, orders or authorizations of, or registrations, declarations or filings with, any Governmental Entity or Accrediting Body required by or with respect to the Company, Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained or made, including, without limitation, 

  

    
  

 the Colorado Commission on Higher Education, the Florida Commission for
Independent Education, the Illinois State Board of Education, the Maryland
Higher Education Commission, the Massachusetts Department of Education, the
New Jersey Department of Education, the New York State Education Department,
the Bureau of Proprietary School Supervision, the Ohio State Board of Career
Colleges and Schools, the Texas Workforce Commission, and the North Central
Association of Colleges and Schools, except for (1) approval from the DOE, (2)
approval from any Educational Agency that, under the agency\'s policies or
standards, cannot be obtained prior to Closing or, due to administrative
preference, may be issued in interim form, provided that such interim approval
is not issued because there is some substantive issue with respect to
issuance of full approval as opposed to being issued because it is such
Educational Agency\'s or Accrediting Body\'s normal practice or procedure or
administrative preference at the time of issuance and (3) such other consents,
approvals, interim approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations, or filings of a type the failure of which to be obtained or
made could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent or materially
impair the Company\'s, Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s ability to consummate the
Merger.

 (b) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 8.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth in this Section 8.3, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the applicable amounts at the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

giving rise to such payment obligations.
