 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 ** _CONVERSION OF SECURITIES_**

 



 

Section 2.01 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of the Company Common Stock or the holder of any shares of capital stock of
Sub:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, of Sub shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Conversion of
Company Common Stock Owned by any Subsidiary of the Company_.

 



 

(i) All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned directly by the Company,
including any shares of Company Common Stock held as treasury stock, or owned
by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, "
_Canceled Shares_ ") shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than Sub)
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, " _Subsidiary Converted
Shares_ ") shall be converted into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation, such that each such direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
that owned capital stock in the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall own the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, and any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and no other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
Canceled Shares, (ii) Dissenting Shares, and (iii) Subsidiary Converted
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $190.00 in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, such shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or evidence of shares in
book-entry form that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Statutory Right of Appraisal_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Canceled Shares and Subsidiary
Converted Shares), and which are held by a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock (a " _Company Shareholder_ ") who has neither voted in favor of adoption
of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who has properly and
validly exercised its statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares
of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such
shares being referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until
such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such
holderÂ’s appraisal rights under the Laws of the State of Delaware with respect
to such shares) shall not be converted into, or represent a right to receive,
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.01_. Such Company
Shareholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such Dissenting Shares to the extent afforded by Section 262 of the DGCL (in
such case, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting
Shares shall cease to have any rights with regard thereto except with regard
to such holdersÂ’ right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares to
the extent afforded by Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ , _however_ , that
if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holderÂ’s right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine

 



     

 

 



 

that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.01_, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate that formerly represented such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of _Section
2.02_.

 



 

(ii) The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock (or
written threats thereof), any written withdrawal or purported withdrawal of
any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Laws of the State of
Delaware that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity
and right to participate in and direct all negotiations and any litigation,
suit, action or other proceeding with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, or approve the withdrawal of, any
such demands or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the
payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the "
_Paying Agent_ "). No later than substantially concurrently with the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent funds in an amount necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ upon surrender of Certificates; it being
understood that all such funds shall be invested as directed by Parent and
that any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to funds made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over
to Parent.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event within five Business Days following the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company
Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_, (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall include an accompanying IRS Form W-9 or the applicable IRS Form W-8,
shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates held by such person shall pass only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in a form and have such
other provisions (including customary provisions regarding delivery of an
"agentÂ’s message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
cash equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the

 



     

 

 



 

right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer
books of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor
may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the
terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day
on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any
other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article II_.

 



 

(d) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any Merger Consideration that would otherwise have been payable in respect of
any Certificate which is delivered to a public official in accordance with any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates
shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity),
any Merger Consideration payable in accordance with this _Article II_ in
respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond
in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay the
Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
Certificate.

 



 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
(including amounts payable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock,
Stock Options, Restricted Shares, RSUs, PSUs or DSUs) such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),

 



     

 

 



 

or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the one year anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.02(a)_ and that have not been disbursed to holders of
Certificates, and, thereafter, subject to time limitations in _Section
2.02(d)_, such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by
such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest
thereon.

 



 

(h) _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company and Sub
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all such lawful and
necessary action.

 



 

(i) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. If, during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock occurs as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend, or any record date
for any such purpose is established, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement will be appropriately adjusted;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.02(i)_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action that is otherwise
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_**

 



 

Section 3.01 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except (i) to
the extent disclosed in publicly available Company SEC Documents filed by the

3.01(c)_, _Section 3.01(d)_ or _Section 3.01(s)_) or (ii) as set forth in

power and authority to carry on its business as currently conducted and (iii)

ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, other than where the failure to be so organized,
existing, qualified or licensed or in good standing (except, in the case of
clause (i) above, with respect to the Company) would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
The copies of the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as amended to
the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Charter"_ ), and the bylaws of the
Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Bylaws_ "),

party to any partnership, joint venture or limited liability company agreement
(other than any such agreement solely between or among the Company and its
wholly owned Subsidiaries) that is material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

outstanding rights of any person to receive Company Common Stock under the
Company Stock Plans or otherwise, on a deferred basis or otherwise.

 



 

(d) _Authority; Noncontravention_.

 



 

(i) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with the provisions of this
Agreement, subject, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, to
obtaining the Shareholder Approval. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company, the consummation by the Company of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the performance by
the Company of its obligations hereunder have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement, the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the performance by the Company
of its obligations hereunder, subject, in the case of the consummation of the
Merger, to obtaining the Shareholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Sub, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with

Section 4.02 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Upon execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company and its

officers and employees to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the other Company Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any third party conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal. In
furtherance of the foregoing, promptly following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Company will (i) request that each person and its
representatives (other than Parent and its representatives) that has, prior to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with such personÂ’s consideration of making a Takeover
Proposal, to promptly return or destroy all non-public information furnished

to the date of this Agreement and (ii) immediately terminate all physical and
electronic data room access for such persons and their representatives to
diligence or other information regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Company shall not modify, amend or terminate, or waive,
release or assign, any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement (or any similar agreement) to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party relating to any such Takeover Proposal and shall
enforce the provisions of any such agreement; _provided_ that the Company
shall be permitted on a confidential basis to release or waive any explicit or
implicit standstill obligations solely to the extent necessary to permit the
party referred therein to submit a Takeover Proposal to the Company Board on a
confidential basis. The Company shall provide written notice to Parent of
waiver or release of any standstill by the Company, including disclosure of
the identities of the parties thereto and circumstances relating thereto. The
Company agrees that it shall promptly inform any Company Representatives of
the obligations undertaken in this _Section 4.02_.

 



 

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 4.02_, the Company shall
not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, or any of
its SubsidiariesÂ’ directors, officers or employees to, and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause each investment banker, attorney,
accountant or other advisor or representative of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, and shall not publicly announce any intention to, directly or
indirectly (and it shall instruct and cause each applicable Subsidiary, if
any, to instruct each such director, officer, employee, investment banker,
attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Company Representatives_ ") not to), (i)

 



     

 

 



 

solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or knowingly take any other action
to facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal (it
being understood and agreed that ministerial acts that are not otherwise
prohibited by this _Section 4.02(b)_ (such as answering unsolicited phone
calls) shall not (in and of itself) be deemed to facilitate for purposes of,
or otherwise constitute a violation of, this _Section 4.02_), (ii) enter
into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person (or any representative thereof) any
information with respect to any Takeover Proposal or (iii) execute or enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Takeover Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, in
response to a _bona fide_ written unsolicited Takeover Proposal received after
the date of this Agreement that the Company Board determines in good faith
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal,
and which Takeover Proposal did not result from a breach of this _Section
4.02_ or any other provision of this Agreement, the Company may, and may
permit and authorize its Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives to, in
each case subject to compliance with _Section 4.02(e)_ and the other
provisions of this Agreement, (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover Proposal (and
its representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement which contains
terms that are at least as restrictive in all material respects on such person
as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement dated October 3, 2018
between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and which shall not contain any exclusivity
provision or other term that would restrict, in any manner, the CompanyÂ’s
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to
comply with its disclosure obligations to Parent pursuant to this Agreement
(it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a
standstill (or similar obligation) to the extent that Parent is, concurrently
with the entry by the Company or its Subsidiaries into such confidentiality
agreement, released from any standstill (or similar obligation) in the
Confidentiality Agreement); _provided_ that all such information has
previously been provided, or is concurrently provided, to Parent, and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with, and only with, the person
making such Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such
Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
4.02(b)_, the Company and the Company Representatives may, in response to a
bona fide written unsolicited Takeover Proposal, contact the person who made
such Takeover Proposal solely to determine whether such person intends to
provide any documents (or additional documents) containing the terms and
conditions of such Takeover Proposal.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any
proposal or offer from any person or group (other than Parent or Sub or any of
their affiliates) with respect to a transaction or a series of transactions,
any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation
or dissolution involving the Company or any direct or indirect acquisition,
including by way of any merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer,
stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or
transaction with a similar acquisitive intent, of (1) assets or businesses
that constitute or represent 20% or more of the total revenue, net income,
EBITDA or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2)
20%

 



      

 

 



 

or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or of any class of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, one or more of the
Subsidiaries of the Company (or in each case, options, rights, or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such
securities) which, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly hold the assets or
businesses referred to in clause (1) above.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any
binding _bona fide_ unsolicited written offer which did not result from a
breach of _Section 4.02(b)_ or any other provision of this Agreement, made by
any person (other than Parent or Sub or any of their affiliates), that, if
consummated, would result in such person acquiring, directly or indirectly,
more than 50% of the voting power of the Company Common Stock or all or
substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and which offer, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company
Board (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel), (x) would result in a transaction more
favorable to the Company Shareholders than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or
otherwise) and (y) would reasonably be expected to be consummated in
accordance with its terms, taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory, timing and other aspects of such proposal.

 



 

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (or shall agree
or resolve to) (x) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the Company Board Recommendation (or the
recommendation or declaration of advisability by any such committee of this
Agreement or the Merger) (any such action, resolution or agreement to take
such action being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
"), (y) recommend, declare advisable or propose to recommend or declare
advisable, the approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal or resolve or
agree to take any such action, or adopt or approve any Takeover Proposal, or
(z) cause or permit the Company to enter into any Acquisition Agreement
constituting or related to, or which is intended to or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in, and in accordance with, _Section 4.02(b)_), or
resolve or agree to take any such action. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder
Approval, the Company Board may, in response to a Superior Proposal received
after the date of this Agreement and not resulting from a breach of this
_Section 4.02_ or any other provision of this Agreement, effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into an alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance
with _Section 7.01(f)_, or resolve or agree to take any such action, only if
all of the following conditions are satisfied:

 



 

(i) (A) the Company Board shall have first provided prior written notice to
Parent (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") at least four (4) Business Days in
advance (as modified, extended or continued by this _Section 4.02(c)_, the "
_Superior Proposal Notice Period_ ") to the effect that the Company Board is
prepared to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior
Proposal, or to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section_

 



     

 

 



 

 _7.01(f)_ , as applicable, which notice shall attach in full the most current
version of any written agreement relating to the transaction that constitutes
such Superior Proposal, (B) during the applicable Superior Proposal Notice
Period (or any extension or continuation thereof), prior to its effecting an
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.01(f)_, the Company and the Company Representatives shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent and its officers, directors and
representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent and (C)
Parent does not make, within the applicable Superior Proposal Notice Period
(or any extension or continuation thereof) after the receipt of such notice, a
proposal that would, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company
Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor
of national reputation), cause the offer previously constituting a Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment or modification of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Superior Proposal Notice with a new Superior Proposal Notice
Period of three (3) Business Days); and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that, in light of such Superior Proposal and taking
into account any revised terms proposed by Parent, such Superior Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make such
Adverse Recommendation Change or to so terminate this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 7.01(f)_, as applicable, would be inconsistent with the
directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, and other than in connection
with a Takeover Proposal, the Company Board may, in response to an Intervening
Event, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or resolve or agree to take
such action, only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

 



 

(i) (A) the Company Board shall have first provided prior written notice (an "
_Intervening Event Notice_ ") to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in
advance (as modified, extended or continued by this _Section 4.02(d)_, the "
_Intervening Event Notice Period_ ") to the effect that the Company Board is
prepared to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section
4.02(d)_, which notice will describe the Intervening Event in reasonable
detail and (B) during the applicable Intervening Event Notice Period (or any
extension or continuation thereof), prior to its effecting an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, the Company and the
Company Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
officers, directors and representatives regarding any revisions to the terms
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent and (C) Parent does not make, within the applicable
Intervening Event Notice Period (or any extension or continuation thereof)
after the receipt of such

 



     

 

 



 

notice, a proposal that would, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the
Company Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of national reputation), cause the Intervening Event to no longer
constitute an Intervening Event (it being understood and agreed that any
material change in any event, occurrence or facts relating to such Intervening
Event (other than in respect of any revisions proposed or proposals made by
Parent as referred to above) shall require a new Intervening Event Notice with
a new Intervening Event Notice Period of three (3) Business Days); and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation that, in light of such Intervening Event and taking into
account any revised terms proposed by Parent, such Intervening Event continues
to constitute an Intervening Event and that the failure to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Intervening Event_ " means any
event, development or change in circumstances that was not known to the
Company Board, or the consequences of which were not reasonably foreseeable as
of the date of this Agreement, which event, change or development becomes
known to the Company Board prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval and
which causes the Company Board to determine in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national reputation,
that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ that in no event shall the following events, changes or
developments constitute an Intervening Event: (A) the receipt, existence or
terms of a Takeover Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence
thereof or (B) any change in the price or trading volume of the Company Common
Stock or any other securities of the Company ( _provided_ that the underlying
causes of such changes may constitute or be taken into account in determining
whether there has been an Intervening Event).

 



 

(e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a),
(b), (c) and (d) of this _Section 4.02_, the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable and in any event within 24 hours after the receipt thereof, advise
Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Takeover Proposal or any request for
information or inquiry that contemplates or that could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Takeover Proposal and (ii) the terms and conditions of such
Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry (including any subsequent amendment or
other modification to such terms and conditions) and the identity of the
person making any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry. Commencing upon
the provision of any notice referred to above, the Company (or its outside
counsel) shall (A) keep Parent (or its outside counsel) informed on a
reasonably current basis regarding the status and terms of discussions and
negotiations relating to any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry and
(B) the Company shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours following the receipt or delivery thereof), provide
Parent (or its outside legal counsel) with unredacted copies of all writings
or media (whether or not electronic) containing any terms or conditions of any
proposals or proposed transaction agreements (including all schedules and
exhibits thereto) relating to any Takeover Proposal.

 



     

 

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.02_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof take, agree or
resolve to take any action prohibited by _Section 4.02(c)._

 



 

 **ARTICLE V**

 



 

 ** _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_**

 



 

Section 5.01 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary
Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning such person to the other as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent
with copies of all correspondence between it and its representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Each of the Company and Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and the Company shall
cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Shareholders
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date the SEC staff advises
that it has no further comments thereon and that the Company may commence
mailing the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i)
shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response, (ii) shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to all
comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (iii) shall not file or mail such
document, or respond to the SEC, prior to receiving the approval of Parent,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If,
at any time prior to the Shareholders Meeting, any information relating to the
Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors
should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.
Except in connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change, no amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without the
approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and that none of
the information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement
will, at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the
shareholders of the Company or at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, or at
the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
covenant is made by the Company with respect to statements made in the Proxy
Statement based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent
specifically for inclusion or incorporation for reference therein. Parent
agrees that no information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent
specifically for inclusion or incorporation for reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or
mailed to the shareholders of the Company or at the time of the Shareholders
Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

 



 

(c) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing
of the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC, establish a record date for,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the
" _Shareholders Meeting_ "). The Company shall cause the Shareholders Meeting
to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of mailing
of the Proxy Statement to the Company Shareholders, for the purpose of
obtaining the Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Company will be permitted to postpone or adjourn the
Shareholders Meeting if, but only if, (i) the Company is unable to obtain a
quorum of its shareholders at such time, to the extent (and only to the
extent) necessary in order to obtain a quorum of its shareholders and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such a quorum as
promptly as practicable, (ii) there are not sufficient affirmative votes in
person or by proxy at such meeting to adopt this Agreement to allow reasonable
time for the solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining the Shareholder
Approval, (iii) the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that such delay is required by
applicable Law (A) to comply with comments made by the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement or (B) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company has
determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is reasonably
likely to be required under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of the
Company prior to the Shareholder Meeting or (iv) the Company is required to do
so by a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with any Transaction
Litigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the Shareholders
Meeting be postponed or adjourned (x) with respect to _Section 5.01(c)(i)_ or
_(c)(ii)_ , by more than thirty (30) days after the date on which the
Shareholders Meeting was (or was required to be) originally scheduled, without
the prior written consent of Parent, (y) with respect to _Section
5.01(c)(iii)_, by more than ten (10) Business Days, or such other amount of
time reasonably agreed by the Company and Parent to be necessary to comply
with applicable Law (it being agreed by the parties that such ten (10)
Business Day period shall recommence if the Company (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) shall determine supplemental or amended disclosure is
required to be disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of the Company

 



     

 

 



 

during such original ten (10) Business Day period) or (z) except with respect
to postponements or adjournments pursuant to _Section 5.01(c)(iv)_, by more
than ten (10) days at a time without the prior written consent of Parent. The
Company shall, at the instruction of Parent, postpone or adjourn the
Shareholders Meeting if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person
or by proxy at such meeting to adopt this Agreement to allow reasonable time
for the solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining the Shareholder
Approval. In no event will the record date of the Shareholders Meeting be
changed without ParentÂ’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company may change the record date of the Shareholders Meeting without
prior written consent of Parent in the event that (1) supplemental or amended
disclosure is required to be disseminated to shareholders, the meeting is
postponed or adjourned, in accordance with this _Section 5.01(c)_ or (2) the
Company postpones the Shareholders Meeting at the instruction of Parent and,
in either case, as a result, the initial record date fixed by the Company
Board is more than 60 days before the date of the subsequent meeting. The
notice of such Shareholders Meeting shall state that a resolution to adopt
this Agreement will be considered at the Shareholders Meeting. Except to the
extent an Adverse Recommendation Change expressly permitted by _Section
4.02(c)_ or _Section 4.02(d)_ has been effected, (A) the Company Board shall
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (B) the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit votes of the Company
Shareholders in favor of obtaining the Shareholder Approval. The Company shall
provide updates to Parent with respect to the proxy solicitation for the
Shareholders Meeting (including interim results) as reasonably requested by
Parent.

 



 

Section 5.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to ParentÂ’s
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants
and other representatives and advisors access upon reasonable advance notice,
during normal business hours in a manner as to not interfere unreasonably with
the conduct of business of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the period
prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to their
respective properties, assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents,
information, directors, officers and employees, and during such period the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish to Parent
and its representatives, as promptly as reasonably practicable, any
information concerning its business as may be reasonably requested by or on
behalf of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or disclose
information where the Company reasonably determines (upon the advice of
outside counsel) that such access or disclosure could jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or conflict with or
violate any applicable Law or any Contract, including any confidentiality
obligations contained therein, to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party; _provided_ that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts (A) to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not
result in a loss of attorney-client privilege or (B) to develop an alternative
to providing such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company. Except as required by any applicable Law
or Judgment, Parent will hold, and will direct its officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and
representatives to hold, any and all information received from the Company
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

_Section 5.03(a)_, each of Parent and the Company shall (A) prepare and file
any notification and report forms and related material required under the HSR
Act and other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as set forth on _Section 5.03(a)(ii)_ of the

to _Sections 5.03(a)(i)_ and _(a)(ii)_ , Parent and the Company (if
requested by Parent), along with their respective Subsidiaries, shall use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain clearance under any applicable
Antitrust Laws so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable, and in any event prior to the Termination Date, which reasonable
best efforts shall include (A) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, disposition, license

 



     

 

 



 

or other disposition of any Subsidiaries, operations, divisions, businesses,
product lines, contracts, customers or assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), (B) taking or
committing to take such other actions that may limit or impact ParentÂ’s or any
of its SubsidiariesÂ’ (including the CompanyÂ’s or any of its SubsidiariesÂ’)

Governmental Entity so as to enable the Closing to occur no later than the

commit to or effect any action contemplated in clause (A), (B), (C) or (D) of
the immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 5.03(a)(iii)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, but
subject to the provisions set forth in _Section 5.03(a)(iii)_ of the Company
Letter, none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall be required to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree
to any condition or limitation that (x) is not conditioned on the consummation
of the Merger or (y) that would result in, or would reasonably be expected to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, (1) a material adverse effect on
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) a material adverse
effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, measured on a scale
relative to the size of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(any of the foregoing, a " _Burdensome Condition_ ").

 



 

(iv) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.03(a)_, if any administrative or judicial action

efforts to (A) oppose fully and vigorously, including by defending through
litigation, any such action or proceeding, (B) pursue vigorously all available
avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and (C) seek to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any judgment that is in effect that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
5.03(a)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, but subject to the provisions set
forth in _Section_

 



     

 

 



 

 _5.03(a)(iii)_ of the Company Letter, none of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to (and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent) take any
action, or commit to take any action, under this _Section 5.03(a)(iv)_ that
(x) is not conditioned on the consummation of the Merger or (y) would result
in, or would reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Burdensome Condition. To assist Parent in complying with its
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.03(a)_, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent such cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by Parent.

 



 

(v) Subject to applicable Law and the requirements of applicable Governmental
Entities, the Company and Parent and their respective counsel shall, in
connection with the efforts referenced in _Sections 5.03(a)(i)_ and _(a)(ii)_
, (A) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing
or submission with a Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Entity relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any proceeding initiated by a
private person, (B) where legally permissible, have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult and consider in good
faith the views of the other regarding, any material filing made with, or
written materials to be submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
person, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this
agreement, (C) promptly inform each other of any material communication (or
any other material correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given to,
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other applicable Governmental
Entity and (D) where legally permissible, promptly furnish each other with
copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications between them
or their Subsidiaries or affiliates, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Entity or its respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable Law and
the requirements of applicable Governmental Entities, the Company and Parent
shall (with respect to any in-person discussion or meeting), and shall to the
extent practicable (with respect to any telephonic discussion or meeting),
provide the other party and its counsel with advance notice of and the
opportunity to participate in any material discussion or meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company and Parent shall jointly develop, consult and cooperate with one
another with respect to the strategy for obtaining any necessary approvals
under the Antitrust Laws or responding to any request from, inquiry by, or
investigation by (including directing the timing, nature and substance of all
such responses) any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including determining the timing and
content of any registrations, filings, agreements, forms, notices, petitions,
statements,

 



     

 

 



 

submissions of information, applications and other documents, communications
and correspondence contemplated by, made in accordance with, or subject to
this _Section 5.03(a)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any
dispute between the parties relating to the strategy or appropriate course of
action or content of any submission made in connection with obtaining any
clearances under applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger, the
parties shall escalate such dispute to the general counsels of the Company and
Parent for resolution. If such dispute is not resolved pursuant to the
preceding sentence, Parent shall have the right to make the final
determination with respect to such matter. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 5.03(a)(v)_ or in any other provision of this
Agreement, Parent shall, on behalf of the parties and in reasonable
consultation with the Company, have the right, in its sole discretion, to
determine the nature and timing of any divestitures or other remedial
undertakings made for the purpose of securing any required approvals under the
Antitrust Laws to the extent any such divestitures or other remedial
undertakings would be conditioned upon and only be effective after the
Closing. The Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this _Section 5.03(a)_ as " _Antitrust Counsel Only Material_."
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.03(a)_,
materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Antitrust
Act of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act of 1914, Council Regulation 139/2004 of the European Union and
all other national, federal or state, domestic or foreign, if any, statutes,
rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and
other Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade,
affecting competition or market conditions through merger, acquisition or
other transaction or effectuating foreign investment, in any case that are
applicable to the Merger.

 



 

(vi) Neither Parent nor Sub shall, nor shall they permit their respective
Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets, business,
person or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture,
collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition would reasonably be expected
to increase the risk of not obtaining, or the risk of materially delaying the
obtaining of, the consent, approval order or authorization of any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) (i) In connection with and without limiting the generality of the
obligations set forth in _Section 5.03(a)(i)_, each of the Company and
Company Board shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation, including the DGCL, is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, or
to any of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, take all actions necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or

 



      

 

 



 

regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) The Company, upon having knowledge, shall give prompt notice to Parent of
any Effect that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or taken together with all other Effects, a Material Adverse Effect, provided
that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect
to any Effect shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this _Section
5.03(b)(ii)_ or the failure of any condition set forth in _Sections 6.02(a)_
and _6.02(c)_ to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the Company by failing to give such notice, in each case unless
the underlying Effect would independently result in a failure of the
conditions set forth in _Sections 6.02(a)_ and _6.02(c)_ to be satisfied.

 



 

(iii) Parent, upon having knowledge, shall give prompt notice to the Company
of any Effect that has had or would reasonably be expected to, individually or
taken together with all other Effects, impair in any material respect the
ability of Parent and Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
prevent or materially impeded or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_
that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect
to any Effect shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this _Section
5.03(b)(iii)_ or the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 6.03(a)_
to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
Parent by failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying
Effect would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.03(a)_ to be satisfied.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any litigation against the Company and/or its
directors relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (" _Transaction Litigation_ ") (including by providing copies
of all pleadings with respect thereto) and keep Parent reasonably informed
with respect to the status thereof. The Company will (i) give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any
Transaction Litigation, (ii) consult with Parent with respect to the defense,
settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation and (iii) consider in
good faith ParentÂ’s advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation. The
Company will obtain the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to settling or
satisfying any such claim. It is understood and agreed that this _Section
5.03(c)_ shall not give Parent the right to direct the defense of any such
Transaction Litigation.

 



 

(d) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each
of the parties hereto, Parent, as the sole shareholder of Sub, will adopt this
Agreement.

be required to effect the following:

 



 

(i) at the Effective Time, each Cash-Out Stock Option shall, in accordance
with any applicable Company Stock Plan or any applicable award agreement
thereunder, be canceled and each holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
in consideration for such cancelation an amount in cash equal to the product
of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are subject to such

(B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Cash-Out Stock Option, which

following the Effective Time in accordance with _Section 5.04(d)_;

 



 

(ii) each Rollover Stock Option shall, in accordance with any applicable

terms and conditions as were applicable under such Rollover Stock Option, the
number of shares of Parent common stock, par value $0.20 per share (" _Parent
Common Stock_ ") (rounded down to the nearest whole share), determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Rollover Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock applicable to such Rollover Stock Option divided by (B) the
Exchange Ratio;

 



 

(iii) each Cash-Out Restricted Share outstanding at the Effective Time shall
be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.01(c)_, which
amount shall be payable to such holder at or as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time in accordance with _Section 5.04(d)_;

 



 

(iv) each Rollover Restricted Share shall, in accordance with any applicable
Company Stock Plan or any applicable award agreement thereunder, be converted

determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Rollover Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share);

 



     

 

 



 

(v) at the Effective Time, each Cash-Out RSU outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, in accordance with any applicable Company Stock Plan
or any applicable award agreement thereunder, be canceled and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive in consideration for such cancelation an
amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that are subject to such Cash-Out RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (B) the Merger Consideration, which amount shall be payable
to such holder at or as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective

terminate this Agreement, Parent shall be entitled to receipt of any
Termination Fee that would have been (or would have subsequently become)
payable had Parent terminated this Agreement at such time. In no event shall
the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, but subject to
_Section 8.11_, the parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee, as
liquidated

 



     

 

 



 

damages and not as a penalty, shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy
available to the Parent, Sub and their respective affiliates with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the
event any such payment becomes due and payable, and, upon payment of the
Termination Fee, the Company (and the CompanyÂ’s affiliates and its and their
respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders and the other Company
Representatives) shall have no further liability to Parent, Sub and their
respective affiliates under this Agreement except that, Parent shall be
entitled to the payment of the Termination Fee (to the extent owed pursuant to
_Section 5.06(b)_) and to any Damages, to the extent proven, resulting from
or arising out of any pre-termination Willful Breach of this Agreement by the
Company (as such Damages are determined taking into account any Termination
Fee previously paid by the Company). If the Company fails promptly to pay the
amounts due pursuant to _Section 5.06(b)_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment
against the Company for the amounts set forth in _Section 5.06(b)_, the
Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including
attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses) in connection with such Legal Proceeding and any
appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts set forth in
_Section 5.06(b)_ at the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

other parties to this Agreement before making, and give such other parties to
this Agreement a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger

reasonably practicable consultation, except as may be required by applicable
Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with

Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

the applicable party with respect to which such party has complied with the
provisions of this sentence and would not otherwise require the other party to
make additional public disclosure

any supplemental indentures required in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation thereof

counsel deliverable prior to the Effective Time and any officerÂ’s
certificates, as may be necessary to comply with all of the terms and
conditions of the Notes Indenture in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that opinions of counsel
required by the Notes Indenture, as may be necessary to comply with all of the
terms and conditions of the Notes Indenture in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be delivered by
Parent and its counsel to the extent required to be delivered at or after the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not make any
settlement election (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by not delivering
a Settlement Notice (as defined in the Notes Indenture) with respect to any
Conversion Date (as defined in the Notes Indenture)) under the Notes Indenture
without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(b) The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any notices, certificates, press releases, supplemental
indentures, legal opinions, officersÂ’ certificates or other documents or
instruments deliverable pursuant to or in connection with any Convertible
Notes or the Notes Indenture prior to the dispatch or making thereof, each of
which shall be subject to the prior approval of Parent (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



 

(c) In connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in the event that Parent desires to consummate a repurchase
offer or similar transaction (including any tender offer) with respect to any
or all of the Convertible Notes (any such transaction, a " _Repurchase
Transaction_ "), each of the Company, Parent and Sub shall use its respective
reasonable best efforts to, and will use its respective reasonable best
efforts to cause its respective Subsidiaries and representatives (and, in the
case of the Company, the Trustee under the Notes Indenture) to, cooperate with
one another in good

 



     

 

 



 

faith to permit such Repurchase Transaction to be effected on such terms,
conditions and timing as reasonably requested by Parent, including if so
requested by Parent, causing such Repurchase Transaction to be consummated
substantially concurrently with, but not prior to, the Closing, and the
Company shall prepare any documentation related thereto in form and substance
reasonable satisfactory to Parent; it being understood that in no event shall
the Company be required to prepare or commence any documentation for any
Repurchase Transaction that will result in such Repurchase Transaction being
effective prior to the Effective Time or incur any other cost or expense in

the Company for all costs and expenses incurred by the Company in connection
therewith.

unwinding or otherwise settling the Warrants and the Call Options, _provided_
that, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, each such election, amendment,
waiver, unwinding and settlement shall take effect at or after the Effective
Time. For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise required by the terms of
any Call Option or Warrant, nothing in this _Section 5.10(d)_ shall be
interpreted as an independent requirement for the Company to be required to
terminate any Call Option or Warrant or be required to make any termination
payment thereunder to any Hedge Counterparty prior to the Effective Time.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with Parent at ParentÂ’s request in connection with, and
at ParentÂ’s request shall use its reasonable best efforts to initiate or
continue, any discussions or negotiations with the counterparties to the Call
Options or the Warrants or any of their respective affiliates or any other
person, in each case, to the extent such affiliate or other person expressly
represents the interests of the counterparties to the Call Options or the
Warrants or is empowered to make any determinations, cancelations,
terminations, exercises, settlements, adjustments or computations under the
Call Options or the Warrants (any such counterparty, affiliate or person, a "
_Hedge Counterparty_ "), with respect to any determination, adjustment or
computation in connection with the Call Options or the Warrants, including
with respect to any cash amounts or shares of Company Common Stock that may be
receivable, issuable, deliverable or payable by the Company pursuant to the
Call Options or the Warrants (including upon termination thereof), _provided_
that no such determination, adjustment or computation, including with respect
to any cash amounts or shares of Company Common Stock that may be receivable,
issuable, deliverable or payable by the Company pursuant to the Call Options
or the Warrants (including upon termination thereof), shall take effect prior
to the Effective Time unless Parent agrees to reimburse the Company for all
costs and expenses incurred by the Company in connection therewith. The
Company shall promptly provide Parent with any written notices or other
documents received from any Hedge Counterparty with respect to any

cause Company Representatives not to, except as contemplated herein, enter
into any discussions, negotiations or agreements in respect of the Call
Options or the Warrants or make any elections, amendments, modifications or
other changes to the terms of the Call Options or the Warrants, or make any
cash payments or share deliveries with respect to the Call Options or the
Warrants without ParentÂ’s prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, except

 



      

 

 



 

as required pursuant to the terms thereof (as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms thereof) and except
any discussions, negotiations or agreements in respect of the Call Options or
the Warrants or any elections, amendments, modifications or other changes to
the terms of the Call Options or the Warrants, or any cash payments or share
deliveries with respect to the Call Options or the Warrants that are, in each
case, contingent on the termination of this Agreement prior to the
consummation of the Merger (in each case, " _Alternative Arrangements_ "),
which Alternative Arrangements the Company may enter into or make, as the case
may be, in its sole discretion, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
keep Parent fully informed on a reasonably current basis of all such
discussions and negotiations and shall give Parent the option to participate
(or have its counsel participate) in any such discussions and negotiations.
The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any written response to any written notice or other
document received from any Hedge Counterparty with respect to any
determination, adjustment or computation under, or in connection with any
discussions or negotiations related to, the Call Options or the Warrants prior
to making any such response, and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly respond to any reasonable questions from, and reflect any
reasonable comments made by, Parent or its counsel with respect thereto prior
to making any such response.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time and without limitation to the other provisions
of this _Section 5.10_, the Company shall take all such actions as may be
required or contemplated by the terms of the applicable Call Options and
Warrants, including the giving of any written notices or communication in
connection with the Merger and/or any conversions and/or repurchases of the
Convertible Notes or any adjustment to the Conversion Rate thereunder or
occurring as a result of or in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide Parent and its counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any such written notice or communication prior to the dispatch or making
thereof, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
respond to any reasonable questions from, and reflect any reasonable comments

Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to honor all compensation and benefit plans, programs, policies,
practices or agreements maintained or sponsored by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
as such plans, programs, policies, practices or agreements are in effect on
the date hereof (it being understood that this _Section 5.11(a)_ shall not be
deemed to prohibit Parent or its affiliates from amending, modifying,
replacing or terminating such arrangements in accordance with their terms).
For the period beginning on the Closing and ending on the first anniversary of
the Closing (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall
cause one of its affiliates to provide, to employees of the Company who remain
employed after the Closing (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), (i) base salaries
or wages that are no less favorable than those provided to Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Closing,

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) target incentive opportunities (excluding retention, change in control
and equity-based compensation), if any, that are no less favorable than those
provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing and (iii)
retirement and welfare benefits (excluding any severance benefits, post-
employment health benefits, post-employment welfare benefits and defined
benefit pension and nonqualified deferred compensation plans) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to those provided to Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) Parent or its applicable affiliates shall, unless prohibited by applicable
Law give, or cause to be given, to Continuing Employees credit for purposes of
eligibility to participate (other than any defined benefit pension, post-
employment health benefits or post-employment welfare benefits plan), vesting
and, with respect to severance and vacation benefits only, determining level
of benefits, but not for benefit accrual, under employee benefit plans
maintained by Parent or its affiliates and in which such employees participate
after the Closing, for such employeesÂ’ service prior to the Closing with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the same extent recognized by the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Such crediting of service
shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit.

 



 

(c) With respect to any Welfare Plan maintained by Parent in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such
conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees
under the Welfare Plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing (other than with respect to pre-existing health conditions pursuant to
underwriting requirements under fully insured plans) and (ii) provide
Continuing Employees with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to the Closing in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements only to the same extent recognized by the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

 



 

(d) With respect to performance periods under any annual and quarterly cash
incentive compensation plans and programs (" _Cash Bonus Plans_ ") which are
ongoing as of the Closing, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board
may, prior to the Closing, reasonably determine in good faith the level of
attainment of the applicable performance goals (and in connection with such
determination, may make adjustments in respect of non-recurring items, costs
and expenses associated with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).
Payment with respect to such Cash Bonus Plans shall be made following the
Closing Date at the time Parent normally pays bonuses to similarly situated
employees (or, if sooner, the time the Company normally pays such bonuses) at
the greater of the target or actual level of performance, pro-rated for the
portion of the applicable performance period which has elapsed as of the
Closing Date.

 



 

(e) During the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, provide Continuing Employees whose employment is
terminated (in a manner that would trigger severance benefits) with severance
benefits in accordance with such employeeÂ’s individual employment agreement or
severance agreement or, in the absence of any such agreement, in accordance
with the applicable severance policy of the

(f) From and after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company and its

(g) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or its
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person. Furthermore, no provision of
this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting the ability of
Parent or its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or
terminate any plans, programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or
understandings of Parent, its Subsidiaries, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation and nothing therein shall be construed as an amendment to any such
plan, program, policy, arrangement, agreement or understanding for any
purpose. Without limiting the scope of _Section 8.06_, nothing in this

upon any Continuing Employee (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof) or

for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
the Company, its Subsidiaries and any Company Representatives in connection
with the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to _Section
5.12(a)_. If this Agreement is terminated following the Company or its
Subsidiaries taking, in accordance with _Section 5.12(a)_, any action to
effectuate (or cause to be effectuated) the matters set forth in _Section
5.12_ of the Company Letter prior to Closing, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives from
and against (i) the excess, if any, of the amount of taxes actually imposed on
the Company and its Subsidiaries over the amount of taxes that would have been
imposed on the Company and its Subsidiaries if such actions necessary to
effectuate the matters set forth in _Section 5.12_ of the Company Letter had
not occurred and (ii) all other losses, claims, liabilities, damages and
expenses (including incremental taxes arising from the Company or its
Subsidiaries reversing any action taken to effectuate the matters set forth in
_Section 5.12_ of the Company Letter following such termination), in each
case to the extent arising out of such action or from reversing any such
action. The foregoing sentence shall be unaffected by the termination of this

way

 



     

 

 



 

relating to any debt financing related to the Merger, shall be exclusively
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the domestic Laws of the State

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Parent and Sub may assign, in their
sole discretion, any or all of their rights, interests and obligations under
this Agreement to any affiliate of Parent, but no such assignment shall
relieve the assigning party of its obligations under this Agreement if such
assignee does not perform such obligations. Except as provided in the
provision in the immediately preceding sentence, any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 8.09 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Venue_. Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if
such court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, then in
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or, if
jurisdiction is not then available in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware (but only in such event), then in any Delaware state
court sitting in New Castle County) and any appellate court from any of such
courts (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), for the purposes of any suit, action or
other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (and agrees that no such action,
suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought by it or any of
its Subsidiaries except in such courts). Each of the parties further agrees
that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such personÂ’s
respective address set forth above shall be effective service of process for
any action, suit or proceeding in the Chosen Courts with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the
immediately preceding sentence. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim), any objection to
the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in the Chosen Courts, or that any such action, suit or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including this
_Section 8.09_), each party agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement
or any debt financing related to the Merger, in any forum other than the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in
the Borough of Manhattan (or if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,
the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan).

 



 

Section 8.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding directly or
indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each
party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of

 



     

 

 



 

any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would
not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto
have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the
mutual waiver and certifications in this _Section 8.10_.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law
or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable
for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide
an adequate remedy for any such breach. In the event any party hereto brings
any action, claim, complaint, suit, action or other proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
prior to the Closing, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended by
(i) the amount of time during which such action, claim, complaint, suit,
action or other proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or (ii)
such other time period established by the court presiding over such action,
claim, complaint, suit, action or other proceeding. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Financing Sources shall have
any liability to the Company or any person that is an affiliate of the Company
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Commitment Letter, whether
at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company
nor any person that is an affiliate of the Company shall have any rights or
claims against any Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Financing Sources_ " means any agent, arranger, Lender
or other entity that has committed to provide or arrange, or has entered into
definitive agreements related to, any debt financing related to the Merger, or
any of such personÂ’s affiliates or its or their respective officers,
directors, employees, partners, trustees, shareholders, controlling persons,
agents, representatives, successors or assigns.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision hereof, and
the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall
not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
