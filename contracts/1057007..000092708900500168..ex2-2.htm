 HUDSON RIVER BANCORP, INC. TO ACQUIRE COHOES BANCORP, INC.  
  Hudson River Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq-NNM: HRBT) ("Hudson River")
and Cohoes Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq-NNM: COHB) ("Cohoes"), announced today that
they have executed a definitive agreement for Hudson River to acquire Cohoes.
Upon completion of the merger Hudson River will be the largest locally
headquartered savings bank in the Capital District region, with approximately
$1.9 billion in total assets and a total of 39 branches throughout
the counties of Columbia, Rensselaer, Albany, Schenectady, Dutchess, Greene
and Warren.  
  
  The agreement provides that the common shareholders of Cohoes
will receive $19.50 in cash for each Cohoes common share. The merger, which
would be accounted for as a purchase, is expected to close in the second
quarter of 2001. The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors
of both companies and is subject to approval by bank regulatory
authorities and Cohoes\' shareholders. The merger is valued at approximately
$158 million. The pricing reflects 125% of Cohoes\' book value at September
30, 2000 and 25.7 times Cohoes\' last 12-month earnings.  
  
  Hudson River estimates that the synergies of the transaction
will produce annual cost savings equal to approximately 43% of Cohoes\'
operating expenses, or approximately $8.0 million, pre- tax. The targeted
cost savings would be created by elimination of duplicative back office
operations as well as efficiencies to be gained from merging the two banks
into one. One-time pre-tax charges in conjunction with the merger are
expected to be approximately $13 to $16 million.  
  
  Hudson River expects that the transaction will be approximately
17% accretive to earnings per share calculated under generally accepted
accounting principles and approximately 37% accretive to cash earnings per
share in the first full year of combined operation. Additionally, revenue
enhancement opportunities would be created by integrating Hudson River\'s
products and services with Cohoes. These revenue enhancement opportunities are
not factored into the resulting earnings accretion estimates.  
  
  "This combination strengthens Hudson River by adding a franchise
that has been a fixture in our community for almost 150 years. This is a
tailor-made opportunity for us to continue our market extension efforts,"
commented Carl A. Florio, Hudson River\'s President and Chief Executive
Officer. Mr. Florio further stated that "the additional branches we will
acquire in Albany, Rensselaer, Schenectady and Saratoga counties coupled with
our expansion into Greene and Warren counties gives us one contiguous market
of similar demographic character ideal for our retail lending and savings
products. With this acquisition, Hudson River continues to build an
attractive upstate New York franchise that will offer a broad array of
products to meet the needs of our customer base. In terms of shareholder
value, this acquisition is expected to generate strong earnings growth to
provide additional momentum to our efforts to further enhance the value of
our franchise."

  In addition to market expansion, the structure of the
transaction using the purchase method of accounting will leave intact
Cohoes\' ability prior to completion of the merger and Hudson River\'s
ability to continue repurchasing shares to enhance Hudson River\'s
shareholder value.  
  
  "We are very pleased with what this transaction means for our
customers, our community and our shareholders," stated Harry L. Robinson,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Cohoes. Mr. Robinson added that "As
part of our marketing efforts we contacted twelve companies, including
TrustCo and Ambanc and asked for their highest and best price. In terms
of shareholder value, Hudson River\'s offer was unequaled. Hudson River is
one of the premier financial institutions in our area and offers a broad
array of products that meet the needs of our customer base."  
  
  "Our Board of Directors has fulfilled their fiduciary duties and
as promised has acted in the best interests of all Cohoes shareholders. We
previously said we believed we could obtain a better price for our
shareholders than what TrustCo offered, and we were successful in doing
so. We urge the Cohoes shareholders to vote for our director nominees and for
the other proposals at our annual meeting next week," concluded Mr.
Robinson.  
  
  Hudson River Bancorp, Inc., Hudson, New York, with 18 branch
offices, had $1.2 billion in assets and $751 million in deposits as of
September 30, 2000.  
  
  Cohoes Bancorp, Inc., Cohoes, New York, with 21 branch offices,
had $739 million in assets and $498 million in deposits as of September 30,
2000.
