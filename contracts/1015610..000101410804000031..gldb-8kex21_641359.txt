                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the  "Agreement")  made and entered into
as of the 24th day of February,  2004, by and among SILVER  ACQUISITION CORP., a
Delaware corporation  ("SILVER"),  SAC ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ACQUISITION ("SAC"), and GOLD BANC CORPORATION,
INC., a Kansas corporation ("GOLD").

                               W-I-T-N-E-S-S-E-T-H

     WHEREAS,  subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Boards
of Directors of SILVER,  SAC and GOLD have approved the merger (the "Merger") of
SAC with and into GOLD and the second merger (the "Second  Merger") of GOLD with
and into  SILVER,  pursuant to which each  outstanding  share of common stock of
GOLD ("GOLD  Common") shall be converted into the right to receive cash, as more
fully set forth herein,  and determined  that the Merger is in the best interest
of the parties and their stockholders;

     WHEREAS,  SILVER and SAC have been formed for the sole purpose of acquiring
GOLD by  consummating  the merger and as such,  SILVER and SAC have conducted no
business apart from raising capital to consummate the transactions  contemplated
herein; and

     WHEREAS,  in furtherance  of the  consummation  of the Merger,  the parties
hereto desire to enter into this Agreement;

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
and agreements  contained  herein,  the parties hereto,  intending to be legally
bound, hereby agree as follows:

                ARTICLE I - THE MERGER; CERTAIN RELATED MATTERS

1.1   Merger and Second Merger.
      ------------------------
      (a)   The  Merger.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
at the  Effective  Time SAC shall  merge with and into  GOLD.  GOLD shall be the
surviving  corporation  (hereinafter  sometimes referred to as the "First Merger
Surviving  Corporation")  in  the  Merger,  and  shall  continue  its  corporate
existence  under  the laws of the  State of  Kansas.  Upon  consummation  of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of SAC shall terminate.

      At the  Effective  Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of GOLD:


                  (i)  subject  to  Section  1.1(a)(ii)  and  1.1(a)(iii),  each
      outstanding  share of GOLD Common  (together  with the related GOLD Rights
      issued  pursuant to the Rights  Agreement ) shall, by virtue of the Merger
      and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, no longer be
      outstanding,  be  canceled  and  retired  and  cease to exist and shall be
      converted into the right to receive in cash, without interest,  $16.60 per
      share,


<PAGE>

     from the Surviving  Corporation  in the manner  provided  herein,  provided
     that, if the Closing  shall not have  occurred  within 150 days of the date
     hereof,  holders of GOLD Common  shall also be entitled to receive,  at the
     Effective  Time,  an  additional  amount per share  equal to the product of
     $0.00230  times the number of days  following  such 150th day  through  and
     including the Closing Date;

                  (ii) each share of GOLD Common and GOLD  Preferred  stock held
     in  the treasury of GOLD shall not be  converted  into the right to receive
     cash  pursuant  to 1.1(a)(i) and shall be canceled and retired and cease to
     exist;

                  (iii)  SILVER  will  provide  funds   sufficient  to  pay  the
     obligations  of the  Surviving  Corporation  set out in  Section  1.1(a)(i)
     above;

                  (iv)  shares  of  GOLD  Common  held  by   shareholders   duly
     exercising  rights,  if any,  pursuant to K.S.A.  ss. 17-6712  ("Dissenting
     Shareholders")  shall  not be  converted  into the  right to  receive  cash
     pursuant to Section 1.1(a)(i); and

                  (v) each share of common stock,  par value $0.01 per share, of
     SAC shall be converted into one share of common stock,  par value $1.00 per
     share, of the First Merger Surviving Corporation.


      (b)   Second Merger.  Immediately  following completion of the Merger, the
First Merger  Surviving  Corporation  shall merge with and into  SILVER.  SILVER
shall be the surviving  corporation  (hereinafter  sometimes  referred to as the
"Surviving  Corporation") in the Second Merger, and shall continue its corporate
existence  under the laws of the State of  Delaware.  Upon  consummation  of the
Second  Merger,  the separate  corporate  existence  of First  Merger  Surviving
Corporation shall terminate.

      At the effective time of the Second Merger, by virtue of the Second Merger
and  without  any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the  capital
stock of the First Merger Surviving Corporation:

                  (i) each share of common stock,  par value $1.00 per share, of
     the First Merger Surviving  Corporation  shall be cancelled and retired and
     no shares of SILVER common stock or other  consideration shall be delivered
     in exchange therefor; and

                  (ii) each share of common stock and preferred  stock of SILVER
     issued and  outstanding  prior to the  effective  time of the Second Merger
     shall be  unaffected  by the  Second  Merger  and shall  remain  issued and
     outstanding.

GOLD shall, at the request of SILVER,  take all necessary and appropriate action
prior to the Merger  (including  executing any  appropriate  consent,  notice or
other  instrument)  to cause the Second Merger to become  effective  immediately
after the Merger in  accordance  with  Section  17-6703  of the  Kansas  General
Corporation Code and Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

                                       2

<PAGE>

     1.2  Merger/Conversion  of Subsidiary Banks.  Subject to the reservation of
rights  set forth in Section  9.18 and any  changes  as may be  required  by any
applicable Regulatory  Authority,  (i) GOLD before the Effective Time will cause
Gold Bank, an Oklahoma  state bank, and Gold Bank, a Florida state bank and Gold
Bank,  a Kansas  state bank to be merged into a single bank  (collectively,  the
"Bank Mergers"),  provided that the merger of Gold Bank, an Oklahoma state bank,
into Gold Bank, a Kansas state bank,  shall be  consummated  as soon as possible
after the date hereof and (ii) immediately following the Second Merger, the bank
surviving the Bank Mergers will be converted into a federal  savings bank either
directly,  or  indirectly  by  merger  with  an  interim  federal  savings  bank
established  by SILVER for that purpose (the  "Conversion").  As a result of the
Bank Mergers, the Merger and the Conversion,  Surviving Corporation shall become
a savings and loan holding  company subject to the supervision and regulation of
the Office of Thrift Supervision (the "OTS").

     1.3 Payment and Cancellation of Options.  As soon as practicable  following
the date of this Agreement,  the Board of Directors of GOLD (or, if appropriate,
any  committee  thereof  administering  the GOLD  stock  plans)  shall make such
commercially  reasonable  efforts to affect the  adjustment  of the terms of all
outstanding  options to acquire GOLD  Common,  whether  vested or  unvested,  as
necessary to provide  that,  immediately  after the  Effective  Time,  each such
option  outstanding  immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled,
and  the  holder  thereof  (as  designated  on  Schedule  2.2 of the  Disclosure
Memorandum previously delivered to SILVER by GOLD) shall then become entitled in
full  satisfaction of such  cancellation to receive,  immediately  following the
Effective Time, a single lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the product
of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price described in Section 1.1(a)(i)
over the exercise  price per share of such option,  and (2) the number of shares
of GOLD Common for which such option shall not theretofore  have been exercised.
Following  the  Effective  Time,  Surviving  Corporation  shall pay all  amounts
payable to holders of such options  according to the preceding  sentence,  which
shall be subject to any required  withholding of taxes and shall be paid without
interest.  GOLD  shall  use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  ensure  that
following the  Effective  Time no holder of any option to acquire GOLD Common or
any  participant  in any GOLD  stock  plan or GOLD  Plans  shall  have any right
thereunder to acquire  capital stock of GOLD, SAC or the Surviving  Corporation.
The Board of Directors shall adopt  resolutions  which shall include  provisions
that any such cash payment will not be subject to Section  16(b) of the Exchange
Act. GOLD will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all of its directors
and officers to agree in writing  that they will  exercise  outstanding  options
prior to closing or accept a cash out payment  equal to the  difference  between
the exercise price of such options and $16.60, subject to withholding applicable
taxes.

     1.4  Closing;  Closing  Date;  Filing  of  Merger  Documents.  Unless  this
Agreement  shall have been terminated and the Merger herein  contemplated  shall
have been abandoned  pursuant to Article VIII, a closing (the "Closing") will be
held as soon as  practicable,  on a date mutually  agreed upon, but in any event
within five (5) business days after all conditions hereto (other than conditions
which  relate to actions to be taken at Closing)  shall have been  satisfied  or
waived,  as  appropriate.  The Closing  shall be held at a location  and time as
agreed by the Parties,  on the same date that the Effective Time occurs,  unless
otherwise  agreed by the Parties (the "Closing  Date"),  at which time and place
the documents referred to in Articles VI and VII hereof will be exchanged by the
parties  hereto and,  immediately  thereafter,  Certificates  of Merger shall be
filed

                                       3
<PAGE>

with the Delaware Secretary of State, and Articles of Merger shall be filed with
the Kansas Secretary of State for both the Merger and the Second Merger.

     1.5 Effect on Shares.  After the Effective Time,  each  shareholder of GOLD
shall be entitled,  upon surrender of certificates  representing  shares of GOLD
Common accompanied by a duly completed and executed letter of transmittal in the
form to be sent to all such  shareholders (as provided in Section 1.6 hereof) to
the paying agent,  which shall be the American  Stock  Transfer & Trust Company,
unless otherwise  agreed to by the Parties (the "Paying  Agent"),  to receive in
substitution  therefor,  an amount  determined by multiplying  (i) the number of
shares of GOLD Common  represented by the  certificates  surrendered by (ii) the
amount set forth in Section 1.1(a)(i). If outstanding certificates for shares of
GOLD Common are not  surrendered or the cash payment  therefor not claimed prior
to three (3) years after the Effective Time (or, in any particular  case,  prior
to such earlier date on which such cash payments would  otherwise  escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority), the unclaimed amounts shall,
to the extent  permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation,  free and clear of all claims or interest of any person  previously
entitled thereto.

     1.6  Paying Procedures.
          -----------------

          (a) As soon as practicable  after the Effective  Time, and in no event
later than five (5) business  days  thereafter,  the Paying Agent shall mail and
otherwise make  available to each person who, as of the Effective  Time, was the
record holder of one or more certificates  representing shares of GOLD Common, a
form letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to such certificate or certificates  shall pass, only
upon proper  delivery of such  certificate or  certificates to the Paying Agent)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such  certificates.  Upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of certificates  representing GOLD Common together
with such letter of transmittal,  duly executed, the Paying Agent shall promptly
pay to the persons entitled thereto in cash an amount  determined by multiplying
(i) the  number of shares  of GOLD  Common  represented  by the  certificate  or
certificates  so surrendered by (ii) the amount set forth in Section  1.1(a)(i),
less any transfer or other taxes, if any,  payable in connection  therewith.  No
interest  will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of such
certificates.

          (b) If  payment is to be made to a person other  than the one in whose
name a surrendered certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the certificate so surrendered be properly  endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer  and that the person  requesting  such payment  either pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than
the  registered  holder  of the  certificate  surrendered  or  establish  to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such transfer or other taxes have
been paid or are not applicable.

          (c)  Each of the Paying Agent and the  Surviving  Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and  withhold  from any  consideration  payable or  otherwise
deliverable  pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of GOLD Common such
amounts as may be  required  to be  deducted  or  withheld  therefrom  under the
Internal Revenue Code or state, local or foreign law. To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or  withheld,  such  amounts  shall be treated for all

                                       4
<PAGE>

purposes  under this  Agreement  as having  been paid to the person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

          (d)   Notwithstanding   anything to the contrary in this  Section 1.6,
neither the Paying Agent,  the Surviving  Corporation nor any party hereto shall
be liable to a holder of shares of GOLD Common for any amount properly paid to a
public  official  pursuant  to any  applicable  abandoned  property,  escheat or
similar law.

     1.7  Certificate  Delivery.  At or after the  Effective  Time the Surviving
Corporation   shall  deliver  to  the   shareholders   of  SILVER   certificates
representing the Surviving  Corporation  common stock and Surviving  Corporation
preferred stock.

     1.8 Lost or Stolen Certificate. In the event that any certificates for GOLD
Common shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,  the Paying Agent shall pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates,  upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, together with such other documents
required  under  Section 1.6 above,  such cash as is  required  pursuant to this
Agreement;  provided, however, that the Paying Agent, may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the payment of cash, require the owner of such lost,

Surviving  Corporation  or the  Paying  Agent with  respect to the  certificates

              ARTICLE II - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF GOLD

     Except as set forth in the GOLD SEC Reports filed prior to February 1, 2004
and the  memorandum  previously  delivered  by GOLD to  SILVER,  which  contains
specific  disclosures   corresponding  to  each  applicable  representation  and
warranty set forth below ("GOLD Disclosure Memorandum"),  GOLD hereby represents
and warrants to SILVER as follows:

      2.1  Corporate Organization, Authorization, etc.
           ------------------------------------------

      (a)  GOLD is a corporation  duly organized,  validly existing and in  good
standing under the Laws of the State of Kansas and has full corporate  power and
authority to

                                       6
<PAGE>

conduct  its  business  as it is now  being  conducted  and to own or lease  the
properties  and assets it now owns or holds under  lease;  is duly  qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in every  jurisdiction where the
character  of  its  business  or  the  nature  of  its  properties   makes  such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such jurisdictions in which the
failure to be so qualified or licensed is not reasonably likely, individually or
in the  aggregate,  to have a  Material  Adverse  Effect on GOLD.  GOLD has full
corporate  power and  authority to enter into this  Agreement,  and,  subject to
shareholder approval,  to consummate the transactions  contemplated herein. This
Agreement  has been duly  executed  and  delivered  by GOLD and,  is a valid and
binding agreement of GOLD enforceable against GOLD in accordance with its terms,
subject to Laws relating to  bankruptcy,  insolvency  (including  all applicable
laws relating to fraudulent  transfers),  reorganization,  moratorium or similar
laws now or hereafter in effect  relating to creditors'  rights  generally or to
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in
a  proceeding  in  equity  or at  law)  and  subject  to  the  approval  of  the
shareholders  as  required  by the  Kansas  General  Corporation  Code  and  the
approvals  described in Section 2.4, the  consummation by GOLD of the Merger has
been duly authorized by all necessary  corporate action. GOLD is duly registered
as a bank  holding  company  under  the Bank  Holding  Company  Act of 1956,  as
amended.  GOLD has  heretofore  delivered to SILVER true,  accurate and complete
copies of the Articles of  Incorporation  and By-Laws of GOLD as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement.

          (b) The Board of Directors of GOLD, at a meeting duly called and  held
under  applicable  laws and its  Articles of  Incorporation  and By-Laws  ("GOLD
Approval"),  has (i) approved this Agreement and the  transactions  contemplated
herein;  (ii)  subject to Sections  5.4(c) and 5.10 hereof,  directed  that this
Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereby be submitted for consideration
by GOLD's  shareholders  at a special meeting to be duly called and held as soon
as  practicable;  (iii) subject to Sections  5.4(c) and 5.10 hereof,  determined
that this Agreement and this transaction  contemplated hereby are fair to and in
the  best  interests  of GOLD and its  shareholders,  and  recommended  that the
shareholders  of GOLD adopt this  Agreement.  The Board of Directors of GOLD has
taken all actions so that the restrictions contained in Section 17-12,100 of the
Kansas  General  Corporation  Code  applicable to a "business  combination"  (as
defined  in  Section  17-12,101),  will not  apply to SAC or SILVER  during  the
pendency of this Agreement,  including the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions  contemplated herein. No
other state takeover statute, or similar statute or regulation,  applies to GOLD
with respect to this Agreement or the Merger.

     2.2 Authorized and Outstanding  Stock. The authorized capital stock of GOLD
consists of 50,000,000  shares of common stock,  par value $1.00 per share,  and
50,000,000  shares of preferred  stock,  no par value.  As of February 17, 2004,
39,840,142  shares of GOLD  Common were issued and  outstanding,  and  4,824,575
shares of GOLD Common were held as treasury  stock by GOLD,  and after such date
the only additional  shares issued or that will be issued were or will have been
so issued pursuant to those stock options and restricted  stock awards described
in the Disclosure  Memorandum described below. As of the date of this Agreement,
no  shares  of  preferred  stock  of GOLD are  issued  and  outstanding,  and no
previously  issued and redeemed shares are held in treasury.  All of such issued
and  outstanding  shares of GOLD  Common  are  validly  issued,  fully  paid and
nonassessable.  Except as set forth above,  GOLD does not have  outstanding  any
other shares of its capital stock or any other securities or indebtedness having
the right to vote on any  matters  on which  holders  of GOLD  Common  may vote.
Except  as  set

                                       7
<PAGE>

forth in the Disclosure Memorandum,  GOLD does not have outstanding,  and is not
bound by, any subscriptions,  options,  warrants,  calls,  commitments,  Rights,
"phantom" stock rights, stock rights agreements,  stock-based performance units,
Contracts  or any  other  instrument  obligating  GOLD to issue or  deliver  any
additional  shares of its capital stock or any other  securities or indebtedness
having  the right to vote on any  matters on which  holders  of GOLD  Common may
vote,  including  any right of  conversion  or  exchange  under any  outstanding
security or other instrument. There are no outstanding stock appreciation rights
or other Rights that are in any way linked to the price of any capital  stock of
GOLD.  There  are  not  any  outstanding  contractual  obligations  of  GOLD  to
repurchase,  redeem or otherwise  acquire any shares of GOLD Common  Stock.  The
holders of the capital stock of GOLD have no preemptive  rights.  As of February
17, 2004, there were outstanding and unexercised  options to purchase a total of
1,196,142  shares of GOLD Common.  The Disclosure  Memorandum  lists the name of
each optionee holding such outstanding and unexercised options and includes with
respect to each optionee:  (a) the number of options granted;  (b) the number of
such options  which are vested and  unvested as of February  11,  2004;  (c) the
exercise  price;  (d)  identification  of the plan,  agreement or other document
under  which  such  options  were  issued to the  optionee  or by which they are
governed;  and (e) the number of options of the optionee  that are qualified and
non-qualified pursuant to the Code.

     2.3 Subsidiaries, Affiliates, etc. The Disclosure Memorandum sets forth, as
of the date thereof, a true and complete list of GOLD's Subsidiaries. GOLD owns,
either  directly or indirectly  through a wholly-owned  Subsidiary,  100% of the
issued and  outstanding  capital  stock of each  Subsidiary,  including  without
limitation,  Gold Bank, a duly organized and validly existing Kansas state bank,
Gold Bank, a duly organized and validly  existing  Oklahoma state bank, and Gold
Bank, a duly  organized and validly  existing  Florida  state bank  (hereinafter
referred to  individually as a "Bank  Subsidiary" and  collectively as the "Bank
Subsidiaries").  Neither GOLD nor any Subsidiary owns any material amount of any
shares of stock of any  corporation or material amount of any equity interest in
a partnership,  joint venture or other business entity, and neither GOLD nor any
of the Subsidiaries controls any other corporation,  partnership,  joint venture
or  other  business  entity  by  means  of a  management  contract.  Each of the
Subsidiaries is duly organized,  validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws  of the  jurisdiction  set  forth  opposite  its  name  in  the  Disclosure
Memorandum.  Each  Subsidiary has full corporate power and authority to carry on
its business as it is now being  conducted  and to own or lease the property and
assets it now owns or holds under lease; and is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing in every other state of the United States where
the  character  of its  business  or the  nature  of its  properties  make  such
qualification or licensing  necessary except for such jurisdictions in which the
failure to be so qualified or licensed is not reasonably likely, individually or
in  the  aggregate,   to  have  a  Material  Adverse  Effect  on  GOLD  and  its
Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole. None of the Subsidiaries has outstanding, or is
bound by, any subscriptions,  options,  warrants,  calls,  commitments,  Rights,
"phantom" stock rights,  stock-based performance units or Contracts or any other
instrument  obligating  GOLD or any of its  Subsidiaries to issue or deliver any
shares of its capital stock or any other  securities or indebtedness  having the
right to vote on any matters on which holders of  Subsidiaries  common stock may
vote,  including  any right of  conversion  or  exchange  under any  outstanding
security or other  instrument  and  Subsidiaries  are not obligated to issue any
shares of their capital stock for any purpose.  There are no  outstanding  stock
appreciation  rights or other  Rights that are in any way linked to the price of
any capital stock of  Subsidiaries.  There are not any  outstanding  contractual
obligations  of a Subsidiary  to  repurchase,  redeem or  otherwise  acquire any
shares of

                                       8
<PAGE>

its capital stock. All shares of the Subsidiaries which are owned by GOLD or one
of the Subsidiaries are free and clear of all Liens,  claims and encumbrances of
whatever  nature  and all  such  shares  are  validly  issued  and  fully  paid.
Subsidiaries do not have outstanding any other shares of their capital stock, or
any other securities or indebtedness  having the right to vote on any matters on
which a holder of  Subsidiary  common stock may vote.  There are no  unsatisfied
preemptive  rights in respect to the capital  stock of any of the  Subsidiaries.
Each of GBCI  Capital  Trust,  GBCI Capital  Trust II and ABI Capital  Trust has
fewer than 300 record owners of preferred  securities.  The deposit  accounts of
each of the Bank  Subsidiaries  are  insured by the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance
Corporation  through the Bank Insurance Fund to the fullest extent  permitted by
law (some of the deposit  accounts of Gold Bank, a Kansas state  chartered bank,
are insured by the Savings  Association  Fund), and all premiums and assessments
required to be paid in  connection  therewith  have been paid when due. GOLD has
previously  made available to SILVER true,  accurate and complete  copies of the
currently  effective  Articles  of  Incorporation  and  By-Laws,  or  equivalent
organizational documents, of each of the Subsidiaries.

     2.4 Consents, Approvals, Filings, etc., of Governmental Authorities. Except
for (i) approval of the Board of Governors  of the Federal  Reserve  System (the
"Federal Reserve"), the Office of Thrift Supervision (the "OTS"), and the Kansas
State  Bank  Commissioners;   (ii)  notice  to  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance
Corporation (the "FDIC") and the Oklahoma and Florida State Bank  Commissioners;
(iii) any required filing with Kansas  Insurance  Department;  (iv) any required
filing or  notification  with the  Department  of Justice  and/or  Federal Trade
Commission pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
as amended;  (iv) with respect to Gold  Financial  Services,  Inc. or any of its
subsidiaries, any required filings or approvals under the Investment Company Act
of 1940,  as amended,  or the  Investment  Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the
"Advisors  Act"),  (v) any  required  filings or  approvals  with respect to the
change in control  of GOLD's  trust  company  Subsidiary  and its  broker-dealer
subsidiary;  (vi)  filings  and  consents  required  with  respect  to  SILVER's
assumption of liability for GOLD's  outstanding  trust preferred  securities and
the delisting of such trust preferred securities from the Nasdaq, (vii) filing a
proxy  statement  with  the SEC in  accordance  with  the  Exchange  Act and the
regulations  promulgated  thereunder;  and  (viii)  filing  and  recordation  of
appropriate merger documents as required by Kansas General  Corporation Code and
the Delaware General  Corporation Law, the Florida Business  Corporation Act and
the Oklahoma General  Corporation Act, no consents or approvals of or filings or
registrations with any Governmental Authority of the United States, of any state
thereof or with any third party are necessary in  connection  with the execution
and  delivery  by GOLD  of this  Agreement  or the  consummation  by GOLD of the
transactions contemplated herein, other than any such consent, approval, filings
or registrations  which if not obtained or made, would not be reasonably  likely
to have a  Material  Adverse  Effect  on GOLD and its  Subsidiaries,  taken as a
whole.

     2.5   SEC Filings and Financial Statements.
           ------------------------------------

           (a)  GOLD  has filed and made available to SILVER a true and complete
copy of each report,  schedule,  registration  statement  and  definitive  proxy
statement  filed by GOLD with the SEC  since  January  1,  1999  (the  "GOLD SEC
Reports"), which are all the reports that GOLD was required to file with the SEC
since such date. As of their  respective dates (or if amended or superseded by a
filing after such date, then on the date of such subsequent filing), each of the
GOLD SEC Reports complied in all material  respects with the requirements of the

                                       9
<PAGE>

Securities  Act or the  Exchange  Act,  as the case may be,  and the  rules  and
regulations  of the SEC thereunder  applicable to such GOLD SEC Report,  and, to
the  extent  not  included  in  the  Securities  Act or the  Exchange  Act,  the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley  Act"), and none of the GOLD SEC
Reports  contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements
therein,  in  light  of the  circumstances  under  which  they  were  made,  not
misleading  (except any  statements  or omissions  therein  which were  amended,
corrected  or otherwise  disclosed or updated in a subsequent  GOLD SEC Report).
Each of the "principal  executive officer" of GOLD and the "principal  financial
officer"  of GOLD (in each case,  as defined by the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act),  or a
predecessor  thereto,  has made all certifications  required by Sections 302 and
906 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act,  and  the  rules  and  regulations  of the  SEC
promulgated  thereunder,  with  respect  to  GOLD  SEC  Reports  requiring  such
certifications.

          (b)   The  audited  financial  statements  and the unaudited financial
statements of GOLD (including in each case, the notes thereto) contained in GOLD
SEC Reports  filed on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q,  including  GOLD SEC Reports filed
subsequent  to the date  hereof on such  forms,  (i) are or will be  prepared in
accordance  with GAAP (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial
statements or, in the case of unaudited  financial  statements,  as permitted by
Form 10-Q and by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X  promulgated by the SEC), and (ii)
present or will present fairly the consolidated  financial  position of GOLD and
its Subsidiaries as of their respective  dates, and the consolidated  results of
operations and cash flows for the periods  indicated  (except that the unaudited
interim  financial  statements  were or are  subject  to  normal  and  recurring
year-end adjustments, and except for the absence of certain footnote information
in the unaudited statements).

          (c)  Neither GOLD nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liabil-
ity or  obligation of a type which would be required to be included in a balance
sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP,  whether  accrued or contingent,  due or
not yet due,  liquidated or  unliquidated,  or otherwise,  (i) except and to the
extent disclosed or reflected in the financial  statements  included in the GOLD
SEC Reports,  or (ii) except for  liabilities  and  obligations  incurred in the
ordinary  course of  business  since the date of the last  financial  statements
included in the GOLD SEC Reports,  which  individually  and in the aggregate are
not  reasonably  likely to result in a Material  Adverse  Effect on GOLD and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

      2.6   Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities.
            ----------------------------------

            (a)  There are no liabilities of GOLD or any of the Subsidiaries  of
any nature, whether accrued, absolute,  contingent, or otherwise, whether due or
to become due, that are reasonably  likely to have a Material  Adverse Effect on
GOLD and its  Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole,  except for liabilities  incurred
since  December 31, 2003 (the  "Balance  Sheet Date") in the ordinary  course of
business.

            (b) Neither GOLD nor its Subsidiaries is a party to a pending action
which is reasonably  likely to result in a Material  Adverse  Effect on GOLD and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                                       10
<PAGE>

      2.7   Absence of Changes. Since the Balance Sheet Date,  there has been no
change  in  the  business,   results  of  operations,   financial  condition  or
liabilities (accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), or other occurrence or
events with respect to GOLD or the  Subsidiaries,  that has had or is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on GOLD and its Subsidiaries,  taken as
a whole.  Since the Balance  Sheet Date,  there has been no event or  occurrence
with respect to GOLD or the Subsidiaries  described in Section 4.2 hereof (as if
the restrictions in such section commenced on the Balance Sheet Date but subject
to the exceptions set forth in Article IV).

      2.8  Proxy Statement, etc.  GOLD's definitive proxy statement with respect
to the  Merger  (the  "Proxy  Statement"),  on the date it is  mailed  to GOLD's
shareholders,  will comply as to form with  requirements of the Exchange Act and
will not contain any untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omit to state any
material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading;  provided,  however,  that no  representation or warranty is made by
GOLD with  respect to any  information  which is  furnished to GOLD by SILVER in
writing for the specific purpose of inclusion in the Proxy Statement.

      2.9  No Violation. Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by GOLD, nor the consummation by GOLD of the transactions contemplated
hereby  will (i)  conflict  with or result in a breach of any  provision  of the
respective Articles of Incorporation or bylaws (or similar governing  documents)
of GOLD or any Subsidiary; (ii) result in a violation or breach of or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to
any right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration or Lien) under
any of the terms,  conditions or provisions of any Contract to which GOLD or any
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them or their respective  properties or
assets are bound;  (iii) violate any order,  writ,  injunction,  decree to which
GOLD or a  Subsidiary  is  subject,  or any  law,  statute,  rule or  regulation
applicable to GOLD or any  Subsidiary or any of their  respective  properties or
assets  except,  in the  case of the  foregoing  clauses  (ii)  and  (iii),  for
violations,  breaches or defaults that would not, either  individually or in the
aggregate,  be reasonably  likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on GOLD
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

      2.10  Brokerage/Fairness Opinion.  Except for fees payable to GOLD Advisor
(as set forth in the Advisor  Letter),  neither  GOLD nor any of its officers or
directors  has employed any broker or finder or incurred any  liability  for any
broker's  fees,  commissions  or  finder's  fees in  connection  with any of the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement.  A copy of the letter  agreement
between  GOLD  Advisor  and GOLD (the  "Advisor  Letter"),  has been  previously
delivered by GOLD to SILVER. Prior to the execution of this Agreement,  GOLD has
received an opinion from Sandler O'Neill & Partners,  L.P. (the "GOLD Advisor"),
dated  the date of this  Agreement,  to the  effect  that,  as of such  date the
consideration to be received by the stockholders of GOLD in the Merger,  is fair
to such  stockholders  from a financial point of view. Such opinion has not been
amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

      2.11  Tax Matters.
            -----------

            (a)  As of the date of this Agreement,  GOLD  and  the  Subsidiaries
have properly filed all federal,  state,  local and foreign Tax Returns required
to be filed ("Returns"),

                                       11
<PAGE>

and all Taxes shown by such  returns to be due and payable have been paid or are
or will be reflected  as a Liability  on the  December  31, 2003 Balance  Sheet.
GOLD's  federal  income tax Returns  have been filed with the  Internal  Revenue
Service (the "IRS")  through its fiscal year 2002,  and all of state,  local and
foreign tax  authorities  have been paid or such taxes have been reserved for in
the December 31, 2003 Balance Sheet, and, at the date hereof, GOLD has not given
or  received  an  outstanding  request  to give any  waiver  of any  statute  of
limitations  relating to the payment of federal,  state, local or foreign Taxes.
The reserves for Taxes  specifically  reflected on the December 31, 2003 Balance
Sheet  are  adequate  to  cover  all  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  Tax
liabilities  payable by GOLD and the  Subsidiaries  for the period  prior to the
date of such balance sheet.  GOLD has  previously  delivered to SILVER copies of
the  federal  income tax  returns of GOLD and the  Subsidiaries  for each of the
periods ended December 31, 2001 and 2002.

          (b) GOLD and the Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time will have with-
held with respect to their employees all federal,  state and local income taxes,
and other Taxes required to be withheld,  except such Taxes which would not have
a Material Adverse Effect on GOLD and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          (c)  No audit or other examination of any Returns  of  GOLD  or any of
the  Subsidiaries  by any Tax  authority is presently in progress,  nor has GOLD
been notified of any such audit or other examination.

          (d)  No adjustment relating to  any  Returns  filed  by  GOLD  or  any
of the Subsidiaries has been proposed in writing  formally,  or to the Knowledge
of GOLD informally, by any Tax authority to GOLD or any representative thereof.

          (e) There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which GOLD
or any  of the  Subsidiaries  is a  party  as of the  date  of  this  Agreement,
including  but not limited to the  provisions  of this  Agreement,  covering any
employee  or  former  employee  of  GOLD  or  any  of  the  Subsidiaries   that,
individually or  collectively,  would reasonably be expected to give rise to the
payment of any amount that would not be  deductible  pursuant to Sections  280G,
404 or 162(m) of the Code. There is no contract,  agreement, plan or arrangement
to which GOLD or any of the  Subsidiaries  is a party or by which it is bound to

any  unpaid or  delinquent  Tax due under any  consolidated  federal  income Tax

     2.12  Employee Benefit Plans.
           ----------------------

          (a)  All employee  compensation,  incentive,  fringe or benefit plans,
programs,  policies,  commitments,  agreements or other  arrangements  including
golden parachute  agreements (whether or not set forth in a written document and
including,  without limitation,  all "employee benefit plans" within the meaning
of Section  3(3) of the Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act of 1974,  as
amended  ("ERISA"))  covering  any  active  or  former  employee,   director  or
consultant  of GOLD  ("GOLD  Employee"  which  shall  for this  purpose  mean an
employee of GOLD or an ERISA  Affiliate (as defined  below)),  any subsidiary of
GOLD or any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is a member of
a controlled group or which is under common control with GOLD within the meaning
of Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"), or with respect to which GOLD
has or, to its  Knowledge,  may in the  future  have  Liability,  are  listed in
Disclosure  Memorandum  (the  "GOLD  Plans").  GOLD has  provided  or will  make
available to SILVER: (i) correct and complete copies of all documents  embodying
each GOLD Plan  including  (without  limitation)  all  amendments  thereto,  all
related  trust  documents,  and all material  written  agreements  and contracts
relating  to each such GOLD Plan;  (ii) the most  recent  annual  reports  (Form
Series 5500 and all schedules and financial  statements  attached  thereto),  if
any,  required under ERISA or the Internal  Revenue Code in connection with each
GOLD Plan;  (iii) the most recent  summary plan  description  together  with the
summary(ies) of material  modifications  thereto,  if any,  required under ERISA
with  respect  to  each  GOLD  Plan;  (iv)  all  IRS   determination,   opinion,
notification and advisory  letters;  (v) all material  correspondence to or from
any  governmental  agency  relating to any GOLD Plan; (vi) all forms and related
notices required under the  Consolidated  Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation  Act of
1985, as amended ("COBRA");  (vii) the most recent discrimination tests for each
GOLD Plan;  (viii) the most recent actuarial  valuations,  if any,  prepared for
each GOLD Plan; (ix) if the GOLD Plan is funded, the most recent annual periodic
accounting of the GOLD Plan assets;  and (x) all communication to GOLD Employees
relating to any GOLD Plan and any proposed GOLD Plan, in each case,  relating to
any  amendments,  terminations,   establishments,   increases  or  decreases  in
benefits,  acceleration of payments or vesting schedules,  or other events which

                                       13
<PAGE>

would result in any material liability to GOLD and its Subsidiaries,  taken as a
whole, or any ERISA Affiliate.

         (b) Each GOLD Plan has been maintained and administered in all material
respects in compliance  with its terms and with the  requirements  prescribed by
any and all Laws (foreign or  domestic),  including but not limited to ERISA and
the Code,  which are  applicable  to such GOLD  Plans and all  Returns  that are
required  to be filed  have been  filed.  No  Litigation  (excluding  claims for
benefits  incurred  in the  ordinary  course of GOLD Plan  activities)  has been
brought,  or to the Knowledge of GOLD, is threatened  against or with respect to
any such GOLD Plan. There are no audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to
the Knowledge of GOLD,  threatened by the IRS or Department of Labor (the "DOL")
with respect to any GOLD Plans. All contributions,  reserves or premium payments
required to be made or accrued as of the date hereof to the GOLD Plans have been
timely made or accrued.  Any GOLD Plan  intended to be qualified  under  Section
401(a) of the Code and each trust  intended to qualify under  Section  501(a) of
the  Internal  Revenue Code (i) has either  obtained a favorable  determination,
notification, advisory and/or opinion letter, as applicable, as to its qualified
status  from the IRS or still has a  remaining  period of time under  applicable
Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such letter and
to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable  determination,  and (ii)
incorporates  or has been  amended to  incorporate  all  provisions  required to
comply with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation.  No condition
or circumstance  exists giving rise to a material  likelihood that any such GOLD
Plan would not be treated as qualified  by the IRS.  GOLD does not have any plan
or commitment to establish any new GOLD Plan, to modify any GOLD Plan (except to
the extent required by law or to conform any such GOLD Plan to the  requirements
of any  applicable  Law,  in each  case as  previously  disclosed  to  SILVER in
writing, or as required by the terms of any GOLD Plan or this Agreement),  or to
enter  into any new GOLD  Plan.  Each GOLD Plan can be  amended,  terminated  or
otherwise  discontinued  after the Effective Time in accordance  with its terms,
without  liability to SILVER,  GOLD or any of its ERISA  Affiliates  (other than
ordinary administration expenses).

         (c)  Neither GOLD, any of  its Subsidiaries,  nor  any of  their  ERISA
Affiliates has at any time ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated
in, or  contributed  to any plan  subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code and at no time has GOLD  contributed to or been requested to contribute
to any "multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in ERISA. Neither GOLD, any
of  its  Subsidiaries,  nor  any  officer  or  director  of  GOLD  or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any material  Liability or penalty under Section 4975
through  4980B of the Code or Title I of  ERISA.  No  "prohibited  transaction,"
within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA,
and not  otherwise  exempt  under  Section  4975 of the Code and  Section 408 of
ERISA,  has occurred  with respect to any GOLD Plan which could  subject GOLD or
its ERISA Affiliates to material Liability.

         (d)  None of the GOLD  Plans promises  or provides  retiree  medical or
other  retiree  welfare  benefits to any person except as required by applicable
law, and neither GOLD nor any of the Subsidiaries  has represented,  promised or
contracted  to  provide  such  retiree  benefits  to any GOLD  Employee,  former
employee, director, consultant or other person, except to the extent required by
statute.

                                       14
<PAGE>

          (e)  Except  as  would  not  have a  Material  Adverse  Effect on GOLD
and its  Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole,  GOLD is in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable  material foreign,  federal,  state and local Laws,
respecting employment,  employment practices, terms and conditions of employment
and wages and hours.

          (f)  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the con-
summation of the transactions  contemplated hereby either alone or in connection
with any other  event  will (i)  result  in any  payment  (including  severance,
unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to
any stockholder,  director or GOLD Employee or any of the Subsidiaries under any
GOLD Plan or otherwise;  (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable
under any GOLD Plan, or (iii) result in the  acceleration of the time of payment
or vesting of any such benefits.

     2.13  Real and Personal Property.
           --------------------------

          (a)  GOLD or one of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable  title to
all real  property and owns all personal  property (i) reflected on the December
31,  2003  Balance  Sheet  as  being  owned  by GOLD or its  Subsidiaries,  (ii)
thereafter acquired by GOLD or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) owned by GOLD or
any of its  Subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 but which assets have been written
down  to zero  (except  in  each  case  for  assets  disposed  of by GOLD or its
Subsidiaries  in the ordinary  course of business since  December 31, 2003),  in
each case free and clear of any Liens,  except as  reflected on the December 31,
2003 Balance Sheet,  and except for (i) Liens for current Taxes and  assessments
not yet due and payable or which can be paid  hereafter  without  penalty,  (ii)
inchoate  mechanic and materialmen's  Liens for construction in progress,  (iii)
workmen's,  repairmen's,  warehousemen's,  and carrier's and other similar Liens
arising  in the  ordinary  course of  business,  (iv) with  respect  to the Bank
Subsidiaries,  pledges  to secure  deposits  and  other  Liens  incurred  in the
ordinary  course  of  their  banking  business,  and (v) such  imperfections  or
irregularities of title or Liens as do not materially interfere with the present
or  proposed  use of such  assets or  property  which are  subject  thereto,  or
materially impair the business and operations  relating to real property of GOLD
and  its  Subsidiaries,   taken  as  a  whole;  provided,   however,  that  this
representation  and  warranty  shall not extend to those  assets of GOLD and its
Subsidiaries which in the aggregate are not material to the business, results of
operations, prospects or financial condition of GOLD and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole.  The  Disclosure  Memorandum  contains a  complete  list of all real
property owned by GOLD or any of its  Subsidiaries  (other than OREO  properties
acquired and held by the Bank in the ordinary course of business).

          (b)  Since December 31, 2003, neither GOLD nor any of its Subsidiaries
has entered  into any  agreement or  commitment  to sell any  property,  real or
personal,  or any other assets of GOLD or any of its Subsidiaries  other than in
the ordinary course of business,  nor has GOLD nor any of its Subsidiaries  made
any  commitment or taken or failed to take any action which would cause any Lien
to attach to any property, other than such Liens which are not reasonably likely
to have a  Material  Adverse  Effect  on GOLD and its  Subsidiaries,  taken as a
whole.

          (c)  All tangible property and assets of GOLD or any of its Subsidiar-
ies which are  material to the  business,  results of  operations,  prospects or
financial  condition of GOLD and

                                       15
<PAGE>

its  Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole,  have been well maintained and are in good
operating  condition and repair, in all material  respects,  except for ordinary
wear and tear.

     2.14  Leases.
           ------

          (a)  The Disclosure  Memorandum  hereof  contains  a list  of all real
property  leases  (the  "Real  Property  Leases")  to  which  GOLD or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party,  either as lessor or lessee (the facilities  subject to
such Real Property Leases being referred to as the "Leased Facilities"). Each of
the Real Property Leases is in full force and effect and neither GOLD nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor, to GOLD's knowledge, any other party thereto has committed
any Default  thereunder,  except for any Default,  that  individually  or in the
aggregate,  is not reasonably  likely to result in a Material  Adverse Effect on
GOLD and its  Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole. No Consent is necessary under the
terms  of any  Real  Property  Lease  in  connection  with  the  Merger  and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement except for any Consent, which if not
obtained,  would not  reasonably  be  expected  to result in a Material  Adverse
Effect upon GOLD and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          (b)  The  Disclosure  Memorandum  contains a list  of all Leases  with
respect to personal property involving  aggregate future payments of $100,000 or
more (the "Personal  Property  Leases") to which GOLD or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party,  either as lessor or lessee (the personal  property  subject to such
Personal  Property Leases being referred to as the "Leased Personal  Property").
Each of the  Personal  Property  Leases is in full force and effect and  neither
GOLD nor any of its  Subsidiaries  nor,  to GOLD's  knowledge,  any other  party
thereto has committed any material Default  thereunder,  except for any Default,
that  individually or in the aggregate,  is not reasonably likely to result in a
Material  Adverse  Effect  on GOLD and its  Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole.  No
Consent  is  necessary  under  the  terms  of any  Personal  Property  Lease  in
connection with the Merger and the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement
except for any Consent, which if not obtained,  would not reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect upon GOLD and its Subsidiaries,  taken as
a whole.

     2.15  Intellectual Property.
           ---------------------

          (a) The Disclosure  Memorandum lists all Intellectual Property that is
owned  by,  and  all  licenses  of   Intellectual   Property  to,  GOLD  or  its
Subsidiaries.  Each license of Intellectual Property is in full force and effect
and neither GOLD nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to GOLD's knowledge, any other
party thereto, has committed a Default thereunder,  except when any such Default
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect upon GOLD or
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          (b)  To the knowledge of GOLD, (i) neither GOLD nor any of its Subsid-
iaries have infringed the Intellectual  Property rights of any Person, (ii) none
of the  Intellectual  Property used in the business of GOLD or its  Subsidiaries
infringes the Intellectual Property rights of any Person, and (iii) neither GOLD
nor  any  of  its   Subsidiaries  has  received  any  notice  of  any  claim  of
infringement,  except when any infringement, or claim of infringement, would not
reasonably  be  expected  to have a  Material  Adverse  Effect  on GOLD  and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                                       16
<PAGE>

          (c)  Except for payments due under the licenses of  Intellectual Prop-
erty listed in the  Disclosure  Memorandum,  neither GOLD nor any  Subsidiary is
obligated to pay any  royalties  or license  fees to any Party for  Intellectual
Property.

      2.16  Certain Contracts, Agreements, Licenses. Except for those agreements
set forth in the Disclosure  Memorandum pursuant to Sections 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15,
neither GOLD nor any  Subsidiary is a party to any agreement  which (i) involves
or may involve  aggregate  future  payments  (whether  in payment of debt,  as a
result of a guarantee or  indemnification,  for goods or services,  royalties or
otherwise) by any of them of $100,000 or more, other than Contracts which may be
canceled on thirty  (30) days notice or less  without the payment of any penalty
or other  termination  fee or agreements  incurred by any Bank Subsidiary in the
ordinary course and consistent with past practices of its banking business; (ii)
is a franchise  agreement of GOLD or any Subsidiary;  or (iii) restricts (a) the
geographical  area in which  GOLD or any of the  Subsidiaries  is  permitted  to
operate  or (b) GOLD or any of the  Subsidiaries  from  engaging  in any line of
business within the financial services industry.

      2.17 Governmental Authorization.  GOLD and each Subsidiary has all Permits
that are or will be  legally  required  to enable  GOLD and each  Subsidiary  to
conduct its business in all material  respects as now conducted,  except for any
Permits,  the  absence  of which  might not  reasonably  be  expected  to have a
Material Adverse Effect on GOLD and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

      2.18  Contracts With and Loans to Officers and Employees.
            --------------------------------------------------

          (a)   As of the date hereof, neither GOLD nor any of its  Subsidiaries
is a party to any written (i)  Contracts  for the  employment  of any officer or
employee of GOLD or any of its Subsidiaries  which is not terminable on 30 days'
(or less) notice without the payment of any penalty or other  termination fee or
(ii) consulting or similar Contracts with any officer or employee of GOLD or any
or its Subsidiaries that is not terminated on thirty (30) days' (or less) notice
without the payment of any penalty or other termination fee.

          (b)  As of the  date hereof,  neither GOLD nor any of its Subsidiaries
has made or committed to make any loan or extension of credit to, or  guaranteed
any obligation of, any officer or employee of GOLD or any of its Subsidiaries in
violation  of  applicable   banking  laws  or   applicable   provisions  of  the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

      2.19   Insurance.  GOLD and each of its Subsidiaries has in effect  insur-
ance coverage and bonds with nationally recognized insurers which, in respect to
amounts,  types and risks insured,  management of GOLD reasonably believes to be
adequate for the type of business  conducted by such  company.  Neither GOLD nor
any  of its  Subsidiaries  are  liable  for  any  material  retroactive  premium
adjustment.  All such insurance policies and bonds are valid, enforceable and in
full force and effect  according to their  respective  terms, and since December
31, 2003 neither GOLD nor any Subsidiary has received any notice of any material
premium increase or cancellation  with respect to any of its insurance  policies
or bonds.  All  policies of  insurance  presently  held or  policies  containing
substantially  equivalent  coverage will be  outstanding  and in full force with
respect to GOLD and each  Subsidiary  at all times  from the date  hereof to the
Effective Date.

                                       17
<PAGE>

      2.20  Adequacy of Allowance for Loan Losses.  All reserves for loan losses
shown on GOLD's  December 31, 2003 Financial  Statements have been calculated in
accordance with prudent and customary banking practices and, are adequate in all
material respects in relation to the Financial Statements as a whole, to reflect
all known and reasonably  anticipated risk inherent in the loans of GOLD and the
Subsidiaries.  GOLD has no  Knowledge  of any fact  which is likely to require a
future material increase in the provision for loan losses or a material decrease
in  the  loan  loss  reserve  reflected  in  the  December  31,  2003  Financial
Statements.  Each loan reflected as an asset on the financial statements of GOLD
and its Subsidiaries is the legal,  valid and binding  obligation of the obligor
of each loan, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of
bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium,  or  other  similar  laws
relating to creditors'  rights  generally and to general  equitable  principles.
Each loan  reflected  as an asset on the  financial  statements  of GOLD and its
Subsidiaries  complies in all material respects with applicable Laws, except for
any  noncompliance  with Laws which,  either  individually  or in the aggregate,
would not  reasonably  be expected to result in a Material  Adverse  Effect upon
GOLD and its  Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole.  No Subsidiary  Bank has any loan
exceeding its legal lending limit or known significant delinquent,  substantial,
doubtful,  loss  or  other  nonperforming  loan  that  is not  reflected  in the
Subsidiary  Bank's list of doubtful  loans,  copies of which list have been made
available to SILVER.

      2.21   Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments.  Neither  GOLD  nor  any
Subsidiary  is a  party  to  any  interest  rate  swaps,  caps,  floors,  option
agreements or other interest rate risk management  arrangements to which GOLD or
any of the Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their properties or assets
may be bound which could  reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on GOLD and its Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole. All interest rate swaps,
caps,  floors,  option  agreements  and  other  interest  rate  risk  management
arrangements to which GOLD or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any
of their  properties  or assets may be bound were  entered  into in the ordinary
course of business and, to the  Knowledge of GOLD,  in  accordance  with prudent
banking  practice and applicable  rules,  regulations and policies of Regulatory
Authorities and with  counterparties  believed to be financially  responsible at
the time Each of the interest rate swaps,  caps,  floors,  option  agreements or
other  interest  rate  management  arrangements  to  which  GOLD  or  any of its
Subsidiaries  is a party is a valid  obligation  in full  force and  effect  and
neither GOLD nor any of its  Subsidiaries  nor, to GOLD's  knowledge,  any other
party thereto has committed any material default thereunder.

      2.22   Material Contracts.  All Material Contracts  relating to the  busi-
ness,  operations  and finances of GOLD and its  Subsidiaries  are listed in the
Disclosure  Memorandum and are in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms,  and neither GOLD nor any  Subsidiary,  or to the Knowledge of GOLD,  any
counterparty,  is in breach or default of any Material Contract,  except for any
breach or default,  which either  individually  or in the  aggregate,  would not
reasonably  be expected to result in a Material  Adverse  Effect on GOLD and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

      2.23  Litigation.  Neither GOLD nor any of its Subsidiaries  is subject to
any Order, having continuing effect, of any Governmental Authority of the United
States or any state thereof. There is no Litigation or other proceedings pending
or, to the Knowledge of GOLD, threatened,  against GOLD or any Subsidiary or any
of their property or assets as to which there is a reasonable  possibility of an
adverse determination and which, if adversely determined, could

                                       18
<PAGE>

individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be  expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on GOLD and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

      2.24  Labor Matters.  There  is  no  pending or threatened union organiza-
tional effort,  labor dispute,  strike or work stoppage relating to employees of
GOLD or the Subsidiaries  which in the aggregate might reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on GOLD and its  Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole.
Neither  GOLD  nor  any  of  the  Subsidiaries  is the  subject  of any  pending
organization  effort or  representation  election by or with  respect to a labor
union.

      2.25  Environmental Matters.
            ---------------------

           (a)  GOLD and the Subsidiaries  are,  and have  been,  in  compliance
with all Environmental Laws, except for violations which would not reasonably be
expected to have  individually or in the aggregate a Material  Adverse Effect on
GOLD and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

           (b)  There is no  Litigation  pending or, to the  Knowledge  of GOLD,
threatened  before any Governmental  Authority of the United States or any state
thereof in which GOLD or any of its  Subsidiaries  has been or, with  respect to
threatened Litigation, may be named as a defendant (i) for alleged noncompliance
(including by any predecessor)  with any  Environmental  Law or (ii) relating to
the release  into the  environment  of any  Hazardous  Material,  whether or not
occurring at, on, under, adjacent to, or affecting (or potentially  affecting) a
site owned,  leased,  or operated by GOLD or any of the Subsidiaries nor, to the
Knowledge of GOLD, is there any  reasonable  basis for any  Litigation of a type
described in this sentence.

           (c)  During the period of GOLD's or any of the  Subsidiaries'  owner-
ship  or  operation  of any of  their  respective  real  properties,  to  GOLD's
Knowledge,  there have been no storage or releases of Hazardous Material in, on,
under,  adjacent to, or affecting (or potentially  affecting)  such  properties.
Prior to the period of GOLD's or any of the Subsidiaries' ownership or operation
of any of their  respective  current  properties to the Knowledge of GOLD, there
were no storage or releases of Hazardous  Material in, on,  under,  or affecting
any such property.

      2.26  Reports and Regulatory Communications.
            -------------------------------------

           (a)  GOLD and  its  Subsidiaries  have timely  filed all  reports and
statements,  together  with any  amendments  required  to be made  with  respect
thereto, that were required to be filed with Regulatory Authorities,  except for
any failure to file  which,  either  individually  or in the  aggregate,  is not
reasonably  likely  to  result  in a  Material  Adverse  Effect  on GOLD and its
Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole.  As of the date of each  such  filing  (or,  if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this  Agreement,  then on
the date of such filing),  each of such reports and documents,  was accurate and
complete and complied in all material  respects with all applicable Laws, except
for any inaccuracy or  noncompletion,  or any  noncompliance  with Laws,  which,
either  individually  or in the  aggregate,  would not reasonably be expected to
result in a  Material  Adverse  Effect on GOLD or its  Subsidiaries,  taken as a
whole.

           (b)  Neither  GOLD nor any  Subsidiary  is subject to any  regulatory
enforcement  action,  nor has GOLD or any  Subsidiary  received  during the past
three years, any written communication from any Regulatory Authority threatening
any  regulatory  enforcement

                                       19
<PAGE>

action,  that imposes or threatens  to impose any material  restrictions  on the
business or operations of GOLD or the Subsidiaries.

      2.27  No Action.  Neither  GOLD nor any of the Subsidiaries has taken  any
action or has any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance relating to GOLD that is
reasonably likely to (i) prevent the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger,  from being consummated,  or (ii) materially impede or delay receipt
of any consents of Regulatory Authorities.

      2.28  Certain SEC Filings.

             ARTICLE III - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SILVER

      SILVER and SAC hereby represent and warrant to GOLD that:

      3.2  Corporate  Action.  Each  of  SAC and  ACQUISITION has full corporate
power  and  authority  to  enter  into  this  Agreement  and to  consummate  the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement.  This  Agreement  has been  duly
authorized,  executed and  delivered  by each of SAC and SILVER,  is a valid and
binding agreement of each of SAC and SILVER enforceable  against each of SAC and
SILVER in accordance  with its terms,  subject to Laws  relating to  bankruptcy,
insolvency  (including  all applicable  laws relating to fraudulent  transfers),
reorganization,  moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in effect  relating
to creditors' rights generally or to general principles of equity (regardless of
whether  enforcement  is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and the

all necessary corporate action.

ment and the transactions  contemplated  hereby have been conducted  without the
intervention  of any Person

                                       21
<PAGE>

acting on  behalf  of SILVER or SAC in such  manner as to give rise to any valid
claim  against  SILVER  or SAC for  any  broker's  or  finder's  fee or  similar
compensation,  except  for such  fees  that  will be owed by  SILVER  to  Keefe,
Bruyette & Woods.

      3.5  Proxy Statement.  The  information  which is  furnished in writing by
SILVER to GOLD for  inclusion  in the proxy  statement  pursuant  to Section 5.4
hereof will include all information required with respect to SILVER and SAC that
is required by the Exchange  Act and the rules and  regulations  thereunder  and
will not be false or  misleading  with respect to any  material  fact or omit to
state a  material  fact  required  to be stated  therein  or  necessary  to make
statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under which they were made,
not misleading.

      3.6  Litigation.  There is no Litigation or other proceedings  pending or,
to the  Knowledge  of SILVER  and SAC,  threatened,  which  Litigation  or other
proceeding would  reasonably  likely have a Material Adverse Effect on SILVER or
SAC.

      3.7  Consents, Approvals, Filings, etc, of Governmental Authorities.
           --------------------------------------------------------------

          (a) Except for  (i) approval  of  the  Federal  Reserve,  the OTS, the
Kansas  State Bank  Commissioners;  (ii) notice to the FDIC and the Oklahoma and
Florida  State Bank  Commissioners;  (iii) any  required  filing with Kansas and
other state insurance departments; (iv) any required filing or notification with
the  Department  of Justice  and/or  Federal  Trade  Commission  pursuant to the
Hart-Scott-Rodino  Antitrust  Improvements  Act of 1976,  as amended;  (iv) with
respect  to  Gold  Financial  Services,  Inc.  or any of its  subsidiaries,  any
required  filings or  approvals  under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940,  as
amended,  or the Advisers Act (v) any required filings or approvals with respect
to  the  change  in  control  of  GOLD's  trust  company   Subsidiary   and  its
broker-dealer  subsidiary;  (vi) filings and consents  required  with respect to
SILVER's   assumption  of  liability  for  GOLD's  outstanding  trust  preferred
securities,  and (vii) filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as
required by Kansas General Corporation Code and the Delaware General Corporation
Law, the Florida Business  Corporation Act and the Oklahoma General  Corporation
Act, no  characteristic  of SILVER or SAC or the nature of either's  business or
operations,  requires any Consent, approval or authorization of, or declaration,
filing or  registration  with, any Regulatory  Authority in connection  with the
execution  and  delivery  of  this  Agreement  and  the   consummation   of  the
transactions contemplated herein, other than any such consent, approval, filings
or registrations  which if not obtained or made, would not be reasonably  likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on SILVER or SAC.

          (b) Each of SAC and  SILVER  has no  Knowledge of any fact that  would
make it  reasonably  likely that  SILVER or SAC,  as the case may be,  could not
obtain any regulatory approval or authorization contemplated by Section 3.7(a).

      3.8   Access to Funds.  Schedule 3.8 contains an accurate and complete de-
scription of the financing  (the  "Financing")  to be used by SILVER to complete
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the amounts of common equity
financing as to which SILVER has entered into binding  written  agreements  with
respect to the Financing as of the date of this  Agreement,  including the names
of the parties to such agreements. SILVER has previously provided to GOLD copies
of the subscription  agreements (the "Subscription  Agreements")

                                       22
<PAGE>

between SILVER and certain investors related to the common equity financing that
SILVER  intends  to  use to  consummate  the  Merger.  As of the  date  of  this
Agreement, the Subscription Agreements reflect binding written agreements for at
least eighty  percent (80%) of the total amount of the common equity  portion of
the Financing (the "Initial Equity  Commitments"),  such commitments are in full
force and effect, and SILVER has no reason to believe that any of the conditions
to  financing  specified  in the  Subscription  Agreements  that are  within the
control of SILVER  will not be  satisfied  in  accordance  with the terms of the
Subscription  Agreements.  SILVER has  recently  delivered  a letter from Keefe,
Bruyette & Woods,  Inc.,  dated as of a recent  date,  stating that it is highly
confident that the preferred stock and notes financing portions of the Financing
contemplated  by the Private  Placement  (as  defined in  Schedule  3.8) will be
obtained  by the Closing  Date in order to provide  funding,  together  with the
funding  committed  through  the  Subscription  Agreements,  to  consummate  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

      3.9   Ability to Pay  Break-up  Fee.  SILVER has on the date  hereof,  and
on  the  Closing  Date  will  have,  unencumbered  liquid  assets,  without  the
completion of any portion of the Financing, to pay the Break-up Fee (pursuant to
Section  8.3(b)(iv)) and all  transaction  costs that have been incurred and are
reasonably  expected to be incurred by SILVER in connection  with the Merger and
the Financing contemplated by this Agreement.

      3.10  Absence of Changes and Undisclosed Liabilities.  SILVER  and SAC are
not a party  to a  pending  action  which  is  reasonably  likely  to (i) have a
Material Adverse Effect on SILVER,  (ii) prevent the  transactions  contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, from being consummated, or (iii) materially impede
or delay the receipt of any consents of any Regulatory Authority.

      3.11  No Action.  Neither SILVER  nor SAC has taken any action or has  any
Knowledge  as of the  date  hereof  of any  fact  relating  to  SILVER  that  is
reasonably likely to (i) prevent the transaction  contemplated hereby, including
the  Merger,  from being  consummated,  or (ii)  materially  impede or delay the
receipt of any consents or approvals of any Regulatory Authority.

                    ARTICLE IV - CONDUCT OF BUSINESS OF GOLD
                      PRIOR TO EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE MERGER

Agreement.

obtain  the  Consents  set  forth in  Section  2.4 and such  Consents  as may be

filing with the SEC,  including by responding as promptly as  practicable to any
comments  of the SEC with  respect to the proxy  statement.  GOLD  shall  notify

<PAGE>

shall supply SILVER with copies of all correspondence between GOLD or any of its
representatives,  on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff,  on the other hand,
with respect to the proxy statement.

          If  at  any time after the mailing of proxy solicitation materials and
before the Effective  Time any  information  relating to GOLD,  SILVER or any of
their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by GOLD
or SILVER which should be set forth in an amendment or  supplement  to the proxy
statement, so that the proxy statement shall not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or  necessary  in  order  to  make  the  statements  therein,  in  light  of the
circumstances  under  which  they are made,  not  misleading,  the  Party  which
discovered such information  shall promptly notify the other Party thereof.  The
Parties shall promptly prepare,  in accordance with the procedures  provided for
above,  and distribute to the  shareholders of GOLD an appropriate  amendment or
supplement  to  the  proxy  solicitation   materials   previously   distributed.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  prior to filing any  preliminary or final proxy
statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or prior to responding to any
comments  of the SEC with  respect  thereto,  GOLD shall  provide  SILVER with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response.

          In   connection   with  the   setting  of  any  record  date  for  any
shareholders'  meeting,  GOLD shall give  SILVER  notice of such  record date at
least five (5) days prior to such record date.  Unless GOLD's Board of Directors
has withdrawn its  recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger in compliance
with Section 5.4(b),  subject to all applicable  federal  securities  laws, GOLD
shall use all commercially  reasonable  efforts to solicit from its shareholders
proxies in favor of the approval of this  Agreement  and the Merger  pursuant to
the Proxy  Statement  and shall take all other  action  reasonably  necessary to
promptly obtain the vote of shareholders in accordance with the  requirements of
the Kansas General  Corporation  Code,  applicable NASDAQ National Market rules,
other applicable Law and GOLD's Articles of Incorporation  and By-Laws.  Subject
to Section 5.4(b) or 5.4(c),  GOLD's obligation to call, give notice of, convene
and hold the GOLD  Shareholders'  Meeting in accordance with this Section 5.4(a)
shall not be limited to or otherwise  affected by the commencement,  disclosure,
announcement or submission to GOLD of any Acquisition Proposal.

          (b)  Except as provided  hereinbelow:  (i) the Board of  Directors  of
GOLD shall  recommend  that GOLD's  shareholders  vote in favor of and adopt and
approve this Agreement and the Merger at the GOLD  Shareholders'  Meeting;  (ii)
the Proxy  Statement  shall  include a statement to the effect that the Board of
Directors of GOLD has recommended that GOLD's  shareholders vote in favor of and
to adopt and  approve  this  Agreement  and the Merger at the GOLD  Shareholders
Meeting;  and (iii)  neither the Board of  Directors  of GOLD nor any  committee
thereof  shall  withdraw,  amend or modify,  or propose or resolve to  withdraw,
amend or modify in a manner adverse to SILVER or SAC, the  recommendation of the
Board of Directors of GOLD that GOLD's  shareholders  vote in favor of and adopt
and approve this Agreement and the Merger;  provided,  however,  that nothing in
this  Agreement   shall  prevent  the  Board  of  Directors  of  GOLD  from  (i)
withholding,  withdrawing,  amending or modifying its recommendation in favor of
adopting and  approving  this  Agreement and the Merger or (ii) not including in
the Proxy Statement its  recommendation  in favor of adopting and approving this
Agreement and the Merger if the Board of Directors of GOLD reasonably determines
in good

                                       28

faith,  after  consultation  with outside counsel,  that, due solely to facts or
circumstances  coming to the  attention  of the Board of Directors of GOLD after
the date of this Agreement, the failure to take such action is reasonably likely
to  result  in a breach  by the  Board  of  Directors  of GOLD of its  fiduciary
obligations to GOLD's  shareholders  under applicable Law; and provided further,
however,  that  neither  GOLD  nor its  Board of  Directors  may take any of the
actions described in clauses (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding proviso if
prior thereto GOLD shall have received an Acquisition Proposal that has not been
withdrawn as of the time of such action of the Board of Directors;

          (c)  Notwithstanding  anything  to the contrary contained in this Sec-
tion 5.4, in the event that the Board of  Directors of GOLD  determines  in good
faith,  after  consultation  with outside  counsel,  that in light of a Superior
Offer it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its  fiduciary  duties to
GOLD or the  Shareholders  under  applicable law, the Board of Directors of GOLD
may terminate this Agreement in the manner contemplated by Section 8.1(h) solely
in order to  concurrently  enter into a definitive  agreement  with respect to a
Superior  Offer,  but only  after the fifth day  following  SILVER's  receipt of
written notice  advising  SILVER that the Board of Directors of GOLD is prepared
to accept a Superior Offer, and only if, during such five-day period,  if SILVER
so elects, GOLD and its advisors shall have negotiated in good faith with SILVER
to make such  adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable  GOLD to  proceed  with  the  transactions  contemplated  herein  on such
adjusted terms.

          For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,  "Superior  Offer"  shall  mean an
unsolicited,  bona fide written offer made by a third party to consummate any of
the following transactions in one or a series of related transactions:

                (i)   a   merger,  consolidation,  business combination, recapi-
     talization, liquidation,  dissolution or similar transaction involving GOLD
     pursuant to which those  shareholders  of GOLD  immediately  preceding such
     transaction will hold less than 51% of the equity interest in the surviving
     or resulting entity of such transaction,

                (ii) a sale or other disposition by GOLD of substantially all of
     its assets, or

                (iii)  the acquisition by any person  or group (including by way
     of a tender  offer or an exchange  offer or issuance by GOLD),  directly or
     indirectly,  of  beneficial  ownership  or a right  to  acquire  beneficial
     ownership  of shares  representing  in excess of 50% of the voting power of
     the then outstanding shares of capital stock of GOLD;

provided,  however,  that in each of case (i), (ii) or (iii) immediately  above,
the  Superior  Offer  shall be on  terms  that the  Board of  Directors  of GOLD
determines, in its reasonable judgment to be more favorable to GOLD shareholders
(taking into account all factors which the Board may  reasonably  deem relevant,
including,  without limitation, the relative value and form of the consideration
offered,  all other  terms and  conditions  of the  respective  offers,  and the
relative likelihood of consummation of the respective offers, including, without
limitation, the presence of a financing contingency, the likelihood of obtaining
financing  on a timely  basis if a financing  contingency  is  present,  and the
likelihood of obtaining any required regulatory approvals) than

                                       29
<PAGE>

the  terms of the  Merger  (after  receipt  and  consideration  of  advice  of a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation).

      5.5  Supplements to Information.  From time to time prior to the Effective
Time, GOLD will deliver to SILVER,  in writing,  information  concerning  events
subsequent to the date hereof in order to keep the information in the Disclosure
Memorandum  previously  delivered timely,  complete and accurate in all material
respects.

      5.6  Further Assurances.  Subject  to Sections  5.4(b) and (c), each Party
hereto  agrees to  execute  and  deliver  such  instruments  and take such other
actions as the other  Parties may  reasonably  require in order to carry out the
intent of this  Agreement.  Subject to Sections 5.4(b) and (c), each Party shall
use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts to perform and fulfill all conditions
and  obligations  on its part to be performed or fulfilled  under this Agreement
and to effect the Merger in  accordance  with the terms and  conditions  of this
Agreement.

      5.7  Deposit of Funds with Paying Agent. On the Closing Date, SILVER shall
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent as depository for the GOLD Common an
amount in  immediately  available  funds  sufficient  to satisfy  the  Surviving
Corporation's obligations pursuant to Section 1.1(a)(i) and Section 1.3.

      5.8  Adverse  Changes  in  Condition.  Each  Party  agrees to give written
notice  promptly to the other Party upon  becoming  aware of the  occurrence  or
impending  occurrence of any event or circumstance  relating to it or any of its
Subsidiaries which (i) is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
it and any of its  Subsidiaries,  taken  as a  whole,  or (ii)  would  cause  or
constitute  a  material  breach of any of its  representations,  warranties,  or
covenants  contained herein,  and to use its commercially  reasonable efforts to
prevent or promptly to remedy the same.

      5.9  Reports.  Each  Party  and  its  Subsidiaries  shall file all reports
required to be filed by it with Regulatory  Authorities between the date of this
Agreement  and the  Effective  Time and, to the extent  permitted by Law,  shall
deliver to the other Party  copies of all such reports  promptly  after the same
are filed.

      5.10  No Solicitation.
            ---------------

          (a)  From and after the date of this  Agreement  until  the  Effective
Time or  termination of this  Agreement  pursuant to Article VIII,  GOLD and the
Subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or permit any of their respective
officers, directors,  affiliates or employees or any investment banker, attorney
or other  advisor or  representative  retained  by any of them to,  directly  or
indirectly:

                (i)  solicit,   initiate,   encourage  or  induce   the  making,
     submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below),

                (ii) participate in any discussions or  negotiations  regarding,
     or furnish to any person any material  non-public  information with respect
     to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiry or the making of any
     proposal  that  constitutes  or may  reasonably be expected to lead to, any
     Acquisition Proposal, or

                                       30
<PAGE>

                (iii)  enter into  any  Contract  relating  to  any  Acquisition
     Transaction (as defined below);

provided,  however, this Section 5.10(a) shall not prohibit GOLD or its Board of
Directors from:

                      (A) furnishing material nonpublic  information (other than
information  regarding SILVER supplied to GOLD by SILVER)  regarding GOLD or the
Subsidiaries to, or entering into a customary  confidentiality agreement with or
entering or re-entering into  discussions  with, any person or group in response
to an Acquisition Proposal submitted by such person or group (and not withdrawn)
if (x) the Board of Directors of GOLD  reasonably  determines in good faith that
such  Acquisition  Proposal  constitutes or is reasonably  likely to result in a
Superior Offer,  and (y) the Board of Directors of GOLD concludes in good faith,
after  consultation  with its outside legal  counsel,  that failure to take such
action is  reasonably  likely to result in a breach by the Board of Directors of
GOLD of its fiduciary  obligations to GOLD's  shareholders under applicable Law,
provided that in any such case neither GOLD nor any  representative  of GOLD and
the  Subsidiaries  shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.10, or

                      (B) taking the actions described in Sections 5.4(b) or (c)
as permitted thereby, provided that neither GOLD nor any representatives of GOLD
and the  subsidiaries  shall have violated any of the  restrictions set forth in
Section 5.10.

            At least five (5) days prior to  furnishing  any material  nonpublic
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any person or
group, GOLD shall:

                  (i)  give SILVER written notice of the identity of such person
     or group and of GOLD's intention to furnish material nonpublic  information
     to, or enter into  discussions or negotiations  with, such person or group,
     and

                  (ii)  receive   from  such    person  or  group  an   executed
     confidentiality  agreement containing customary  limitations on the use and
     disclosure of all written and oral nonpublic  information furnished to such
     person  or  group  by or on  behalf  of GOLD,  and  contemporaneously  with
     furnishing any such information to such person or group, GOLD shall furnish
     such  information  to SILVER (to the extent such  information  has not been
     previously furnished by GOLD to SILVER).

            Nothing in this Section  5.10(a)  shall prevent GOLD or its Board of
Directors  from  complying  with  Rules  14e-2 and 14d-9  promulgated  under the
Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition  Proposal.  GOLD and the Subsidiaries
will immediately cease, as of the date hereof, any and all existing  activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties  conducted  heretofore with respect
to any  Acquisition  Proposal,  subject to the right to renew  such  activities,
discussions or  negotiations  in accordance with Section 5.4(c) or Section 5.10.
Without  limiting the  foregoing,  it is  understood  that any  violation of the
restrictions  set forth in this  Section 5.10 by any officer or director of GOLD
or any of the Subsidiaries or any investment  banker,  attorney or other advisor
or  representative  of GOLD or any of the  Subsidiaries  shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 5.10 by GOLD.

            For purposes of this  Agreement,  "Acquisition  Proposal" shall mean

relating to any  Acquisition  Transaction.  For the purposes of this  Agreement,
"Acquisition  Transaction"  shall  mean any  transaction  or series  of  related
transactions  other  than  the  transactions   contemplated  by  this  Agreement
involving:

                       (i)  any  acquisition or purchase from GOLD by any person
     or "group" (as defined  under  Section  13(d) of the  Exchange  Act and the
     rules and regulations  thereunder) of more than a 15% interest in the total
     outstanding  voting  securities of GOLD or any of its  Subsidiaries  or any
     tender  offer or exchange  offer that if  consummated  would  result in any
     person or "group" (as defined  under  Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
     the rules and regulations  thereunder)  beneficially  owning 15% or more of
     the total outstanding voting securities of GOLD or any of the Subsidiaries,
     or any merger,  consolidation,  business combination or similar transaction
     involving GOLD or any of the Bank Subsidiaries;

                        (ii) any  sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course
     of  business),  exchange,  transfer,  license  (other than in the  ordinary
     course of business),  acquisition  or  disposition  of more than 15% of the
     assets of GOLD; or

                        (iii) any liquidation or dissolution of GOLD.

          (b)  In  addition to the obligations of GOLD set forth in Section 5.10
(a), GOLD as promptly as  practicable  shall advise SILVER orally and in writing
of any request received by GOLD after the date hereof for information which GOLD
reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition  Proposal or of any Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiry received by GOLD after the date hereof with respect to,
or which GOLD reasonably  believes would lead to any Acquisition  Proposal,  the
material terms and conditions of such request,  Acquisition Proposal or inquiry,
and the  identity of the person or group  making any such  request,  Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry.  GOLD will keep SILVER informed in all material respects of
the status and details (including material amendments or proposed amendments) of
any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

      5.11  Indemnification.
            ---------------

           (a) In the event of any threatened  or  actual claim,  action,  suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which
any  person  who is now,  or has  been at any  time  prior  to the  date of this
Agreement,  or who becomes prior to the Effective  Time, a director,  officer or
employee  of GOLD or the  Subsidiaries  (the  "Indemnified  Parties")  is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole
or in part out of, or pertaining to:

                (i) the fact that he is or was a  director, officer or  employee
     of GOLD or the Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or

                (ii) this  Agreement or  any  of the  transactions  contemplated
     hereby,

                                       32
<PAGE>

whether in any case  asserted  or arising  before or after the  Effective  Time,
SILVER,  Surviving  Corporation  and  GOLD  agree  to  cooperate  and use  their
commercially  reasonable  efforts to defend against and respond  thereto.  It is
understood and agreed that after the Effective Time, Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each
such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,  costs,
expenses  (including  reasonably  attorney's fees and expenses in advance of the
final  disposition  of any claim,  suit,  proceeding  or  investigation  to each
Indemnified  Party to the fullest  extent  permitted  by law upon receipt of any
undertaking  required by applicable Law),  judgments,  fines and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or  investigation,  and in the event of any such threatened or actual
claim,  action, suit,  proceeding or investigation  (whether asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified  Parties may retain counsel
reasonably  satisfactory to them after consultation with Surviving  Corporation;
provided, however, that

                (iii) Surviving  Corporation  shall have the right to assume the
     defense thereof and upon such assumption Surviving Corporation shall not be
     liable to any Indemnified  Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or
     any  other  expenses  subsequently  incurred  by an  Indemnified  Party  in
     connection with the defense thereof,  except that if Surviving  Corporation
     elects not to assume such  defense or counsel for the  Indemnified  Parties
     reasonably  advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest
     between  Surviving  Corporation,  on the  one  hand,  and  the  Indemnified
     Parties,  on the other hand,  the  Indemnified  Parties may retain  counsel
     reasonably   satisfactory  to  them  after   consultation   with  Surviving
     Corporation,  and Surviving  Corporation  shall pay the reasonable fees and
     expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties,

                (iv)  Surviving Corporation shall in all cases be obligated pur-
     suant  to this  paragraph  to pay for  only  one  firm of  counsel  for all
     Indemnified Parties,

                (v)  Surviving Corporation shall not be liable  for any  settle-
     ment effected  without their prior written consent (which consent shall not
     be unreasonably withheld), and

                (vi) Surviving Corporation shall have no obligation hereunder to
     any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent  jurisdiction  shall
     ultimately  determine,  and such determination  shall have become final and
     nonappealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
     contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law.

            Any Indemnified  Party wishing to claim  Indemnification  under this
Section  5.11,  upon  learning of any such claim,  action,  suit,  proceeding or
investigation,  shall promptly notify Surviving  Corporation  thereof,  provided
that the  failure to so notify  shall not affect the  obligations  of  Surviving
Corporation under this Section 5.11, except to the extent such failure to notify
materially  prejudices  Surviving  Corporation.  The  obligations  of  Surviving
Corporation  under this  Section  5.11 shall  continue  in full force and effect
without time limit from and after the Effective Time.

                                       33
<PAGE>

          (b) Surviving  Corporation  shall  continue  existing  directors'  and
officers'  liability  insurance  or  enter  into  continuation   directors'  and
officers'  liability  insurance  policies with GOLD's current carrier(s) so that
persons serving as officers and directors of GOLD as of the date hereof,  or any
subsequent period after the date hereof until immediately prior to the Effective
Time,  will be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Effective  Time by
the  directors'  and officers'  liability  insurance  policies,  including  both
primary  and  excess  coverage,  maintained  by GOLD  (provided  that  Surviving
Corporation may substitute  therefor  policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts  containing  terms and conditions which are not less  advantageous  than
such policy) with respect to acts or omissions  occurring prior to the Effective
Time which were  committed by such officers and  directors in their  capacity as
such;  provided,  however,  that in no  event  shall  Surviving  Corporation  be
required  to expend  on an annual  basis  more than 200% of the  current  amount
expended by GOLD on such primary and excess  coverages per year (the  "Insurance
Amount") to maintain or procure insurance coverage, and further provided that if
Surviving  Corporation is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance  called for
by this Section 5.11(b), Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance
Amount.

          (c) The parties hereto intend, to the extent not prohibited by applic-
able Law, that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.11 shall apply
without limitation to negligent acts or omissions by an Indemnified Person. This
Section  5.11  shall not limit or  otherwise  adversely  affect  any  rights any
Indemnified  Person  may have  under any  agreement  with  GOLD or under  GOLD's
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws as presently in effect.

          (d) In the  event  Surviving  Corporation  or any of its successors or
assigns (i)  consolidates  with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the  continuing  or surviving  corporation  or entity of such  consolidation  or
merger,  or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
or assets to any person,  then, and in each such case, to the extent  necessary,
proper  provision  shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Surviving
Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.

          (e) The  provisions  of this  Section 5.11  are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each  Indemnified  Party and his or her
heirs and  representatives.  Each  Indemnified  Person is intended to be a third
party beneficiary of this Section 5.11.

      5.12  Environmental  Assessments.  SILVER may have performed on its behalf
and at its cost,  such  environmental  assessments of all real property owned or
leased by GOLD or the Subsidiaries, as it deems desirable.

      5.13  Adequate Funding.  SILVER will use commercially  reasonable  efforts
to (a) have entered into subscription  agreements  constituting  binding written
agreements with respect to the remaining  amount of the common equity portion of
the Financing (the "Remaining Equity Commitments") within 60 days after the date
hereof  (b)  receive  a  commitment  letter  or other  documentation  reasonably
satisfactory to GOLD from an FDIC insured financial  institution giving evidence
of such  institution's  commitment to fund a credit facility  sufficient for the
remainder of the  Financing  within 60 days after the date hereof and (c) obtain
immediately  available  funds  from the  Financing  by the  Closing  to  perform
Surviving  Corporation's  obligations to make the payments  required in Sections
1.1(a)(i) and 1.3.

this  Agreement,  and except as  otherwise  provided  herein,  SILVER or SAC, as
applicable,  shall prepare,  with the assistance of GOLD, all necessary  filings
with  any  Regulatory  Authorities  which  may  be  necessary  for  approval  to
consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement,  and  shall use
commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  secure  all  such  approvals  as  soon as

      5.15  Resignations.  GOLD shall  use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to
obtain and tender  resignations,  or give such notice of such meetings as may be
necessary,  and as requested by SILVER, so that at Closing Surviving Corporation

deem desirable.

Merger and shall permit SILVER to make or cause to be made such investigation of

      9.9  Severability.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement,  or
the  application  thereof,  becomes  or is  declared  by a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction  to be  illegal,  void  or  unenforceable,  the  remainder  of this
Agreement  will  continue in full force and effect and the  application  of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably
to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace
such  void or  unenforceable  provision  of  this  Agreement  with a  valid  and
enforceable  provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,  the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

      9.10  Other Remedies; Specific Performance.  Except  as otherwise provided
herein,  any and all remedies  herein  expressly  conferred upon a Party will be
deemed  cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred  hereby,
or by law or equity  upon such  Party,  and the  exercise  by a Party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other  remedy.  The parties  hereto
agree  that  irreparable  damage  would  occur  in  the  event  that  any of the
provisions  of this  Agreement  were not  performed  in  accordance  with  their
specific terms or were  otherwise  breached.  It is accordingly  agreed that the
Parties  shall be  entitled  to seek an  injunction  or  injunctions  to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce  specifically the terms and provisions
hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction,  this
being in  addition to any other  remedy to which they are  entitled at law or in
equity.  In any action at law or suit in equity to enforce this Agreement or the
rights of any of the Parties,  the prevailing Party in such action or suit shall
be entitled to receive a reasonable  sum for its  attorneys'  fees and all other
reasonable costs and expenses incurred in such action or suit.

      9.11  Rules of  Construction.  The  parties  hereto  agree  that they have
been  represented  by  counsel  during the  negotiation  and  execution  of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,  holding
or rule of  construction  providing  that  ambiguities  in an agreement or other
document  will be  construed  against  the  party  drafting  such  agreement  or
document.
