For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) &#8220;Good Clinical Practices&#8221; means the FDA&#8217;s  standards  for  the  design,  conduct,  performance,  monitoring,  auditing,  recording,  analysis  and  reporting of clinical trials contained in 21 C.F.R.

(a)   Schedule 3.10(a) sets forth, as of the date hereof, a list of all of the real  property owned by any Group Company (such real property, the &#8220;Owned Real Property&#8221;).  The  Group Companies have good and marketable title to the Owned Real Property free and clear of  any Lien other than Permitted Liens.                 (b)   Schedule 3.10(b) sets forth, as of the date hereof, a list of all material real  property to which any Group Company has a valid leasehold interest (collectively, the &#8220;Leased  Realty&#8221;).               (c)   One of the Group Companies possesses leasehold interests in the Leased  Realty pursuant to the leases set forth on Schedule 3.10(b) (the &#8220;Leases&#8221;), free and clear of any  Liens except Permitted Liens.  The Company has provided the Parent with copies of all Leases.  Each  Lease is  in  full  force  and  effect  and  enforceable against the  applicable Group  Company  party  to  such  Lease  and,  to  the  knowledge  of  the  Company,  each  other  party  thereto  in  accordance with its terms in all material respects.  To the knowledge of the Company, no event  has occurred or condition exists that constitutes, or after notice or lapse of time or both would  constitute, a material default under any of the Leases that would have a Material Adverse Effect.  Additionally,  one  of  the  Group  Companies  previously  held  leasehold  interests  in  certain  real  property  pursuant  to  the  terminated  leases  as  identified  on  Schedule 3.10(b)  (the  &#8220;Terminated  Leases&#8221;).  The Company  has provided the Parent with copies of all Terminated Leases.  Each  Terminated Lease properly has been terminated and is no longer in effect, with the exception of  certain indemnification provisions thereof which by their terms survive such termination.  To the  knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred or condition exists that constitutes, or after  notice or lapse of time or both would constitute, a claim under such indemnification provisions  of the Terminated Leases, or a claim otherwise by the former landlord thereunder.         3.11  Tax Matters.               (a)   Each  member  of  the  Group  Companies  has  timely  filed  with  the  appropriate Governmental Entity all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by it (taking into  account any extensions of time to file that have been duly perfected), and all such Tax Returns  are true, correct and complete in all material respects.               (b)   All  Taxes  due  and  payable  by  any  member  of  the  Group  Companies  (whether or not shown or required to be shown on any Tax Return) have been timely and fully  paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity or properly accrued.  The provision for Taxes on the  Latest Balance Sheet is sufficient for all accrued and unpaid Taxes of the Group Companies as of  the date thereof.  Since the date of the Last Balance Sheet, no member of the Group Companies  has incurred any liability for Taxes outside the Ordinary Course of Business.  All Taxes that any  member of the Group Companies is obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee,  customer, creditor, stockholder, or third party have been fully paid or properly accrued, and each  member  of  the  Group  Companies  has  maintained  all  material  required  records  with  respect  thereto,  in  connection  with  amounts  paid  or  owing  to  any  employee,  customer,  creditor,  stockholder, or other third party.                                         17  </FONT></DIV>

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 3  of this Article Eighth, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify an Indemnified Person in  connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Indemnified Person only if  the  commencement  of  such  Proceeding  (or  part  thereof)  by  the  Indemnified  Person  was  authorized in advance by the Board of Directors.               2.    Prepayment of Expenses of Directors and Officers.  The Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys&#8217; fees) incurred by an Indemnified Person in defending any  Proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that such payment of expenses  in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding shall, to the extent required by law, be made  only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Indemnified Person to repay all amounts advanced if  it should be ultimately determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified  under this Article Eighth or otherwise.               3.    Claims  by  Directors  and  Officers.   If  a  claim  for  indemnification  or advancement  of  expenses  under  this  Article  Eighth  is  not  paid  in  full  within  30  days  after  a  written  claim  therefor  by  the  Indemnified  Person  has  been  received  by  the  Corporation,  the  indemnified Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in  whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim.

Amendment  or  Repeal.   The  right  to  indemnification  and  advancement conferred in this Article Eighth shall be a contract between the Corporation and each person who  is covered by this Article Eighth while this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is  in effect.

(b)    The Corporation shall prepare, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders,  a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (provided, however, if the record date for  determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the date of the meeting, the list shall  reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical  order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each  stockholder.

If the meeting is to be held at a  place, then a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place  of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be examined by any stockholder who is present.  If the  meeting  is  to  be  held  solely  by  means  of  remote  communication,  then  the  list  shall  also  be  open  to  the  examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic  network,  and  the  information  required  to  access  such  list  shall  be  provided  with  the  notice  of  the  meeting.

(c)    The Board of Directors shall determine from time to time whether and, if allowed,  when and under what conditions and regulations the accounts and books of the Corporation (except such as  may be by law specifically open to inspection or as otherwise provided by these Bylaws) or any of them shall  be open to the inspection of the stockholders and the stockholders&#8217; rights in respect thereof.          Section 2.   Waivers  of  Notice.  Any  waiver  of  notice,  given  by  the  person  entitled  to  notice,  whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at  a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the  express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the  meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any  regular  or  special  meeting  of  the  stockholders,  directors,  or  members  of  a  committee  of  directors  need  be  specified in a waiver of notice.

Paragraph  Titles.   The  titles  of  the  paragraphs  have  been  inserted  as  a  matter  of  reference only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of the terms and provisions  hereof.                                              8  </FONT></DIV>

Waiver. No failure on the part of Parent or any other of the Parent Indemnified Parties, the Released Parties and the Released Party Affiliates (collectively, the &#8220;Parent Parties&#8221;) to exercise any  power, right,  privilege or remedy  of  this Agreement, and  no delay  by  Parent in  exercising  any  power,  right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, will operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege  or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy will preclude  any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. None of the Parent  Parties  will  be  deemed  to  have  waived  any  claim  arising  out  of  this  Agreement,  or  any  power,  right,  privilege  or  remedy  under  this  Agreement,  unless  the  waiver  of  such  claim,  power,  right,  privilege  or  remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Parent  Party; and any such waiver will not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in  which it is given.         h.    Counterparts; Exchanges by Electronic Transmission or Facsimile.

Interpretation.   The  use  of  the  words  &#8220;or&#8221;,  &#8220;and/or&#8221;,  &#8220;either&#8221;  and  &#8220;any&#8221;  shall  not  be exclusive.         j.    Effectiveness.  This  Agreement  shall  become  effective  with  respect  to  each  party  only upon (a) execution of the Merger Agreement by all parties thereto, and (b) execution by each party of this  Agreement.   This  Agreement  will  terminate  automatically  and  be  of  no  further  force  or  effect  if  the  Merger  Agreement  terminates  for  any  reason  in accordance  with  its  terms  without the  Closing  having  occurred.
