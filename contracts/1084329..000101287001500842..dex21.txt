                                   THE OFFER
                                   ---------

     Section 2.1  The Offer. (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have
                  ---------
been terminated in accordance with its terms and none of the conditions set
forth in Annex A hereto shall have occurred or be continuing, Parent shall cause
         -------
Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub shall, commence the Offer as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days after the date hereof. The obligation of Merger Sub to accept
for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to (i) the
condition that at least the number of Shares that when added to Shares already
owned by Parent and its direct and

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries, if any, shall constitute a majority of the
then outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis (including, without limitation,
all Shares issuable upon the conversion of any outstanding convertible
securities or upon the exercise of any outstanding options or warrants which are
vested as of the date hereof or are capable of vesting during the ninety (90)
day period following the consummation of the Offer and have an exercise price of
$10.00 per Share or less) shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn
prior to the expiration of the Offer (the "Minimum Condition") and (ii) there
                                           -----------------
shall not have occurred or be continuing any of the conditions set forth in
Annex A hereto. Parent expressly reserves the right to waive any such condition,
-------
to increase the Per Share Amount, and to make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer; provided, however, that no change may be made by Parent
without the prior written consent of the Company which (A) decreases the Per
Share Amount or changes the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (B)
waives the Minimum Condition, (C) reduces the maximum number of Shares to be
purchased in the Offer, (D) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those
set forth in Annex A hereto or (E) amends any term of the Offer in any other
             -------
manner materially adverse to the holders of the Shares.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub may, without the consent of the
Company, (i) extend the Offer beyond the scheduled expiration date, which shall
be twenty (20) Business Days following the commencement of the Offer, if, at the
scheduled expiration of the Offer, any of the conditions to Merger Sub's
obligation to accept for payment Shares shall not be satisfied or waived, (ii)
extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation
or position of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"),
                                                                          ---
or the staff thereof, applicable to the Offer, or (iii) extend the Offer for an
aggregate period of not more than ten (10) Business Days beyond the latest
applicable date that would otherwise be permitted under clause (i) or (ii) of
this sentence, if, as of such date, all of the conditions to Merger Sub's
obligations to accept for payment Shares are satisfied or waived, but the number
of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer totals less
than ninety percent (90%) of the issued and outstanding Shares on a fully
diluted basis.  The Per Share Amount shall, subject to any applicable
withholding of Taxes, be net to the sellers of the Shares in cash, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer.  Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
and Merger Sub shall, accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered
and not withdrawn as promptly as practicable following satisfaction of the
Minimum Condition.  Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence and
subject to the applicable rules of the SEC and the terms and conditions of the
Offer, Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to delay payment for Shares in
order to comply in whole or in part with applicable Laws.  Any such delay shall
be effected in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").  If the payment equal to the Per Share
                          ------------
Amount in cash is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered certificate formerly evidencing Shares is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid
all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of such amount to
a Person other than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or
shall have established to the satisfaction of Merger Sub that such Taxes either
have been paid or are

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

not applicable. If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or by the Company,
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub shall, terminate promptly the
Offer.

     (c)  As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of
the Offer, Parent shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO")
                                                               -----------
with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or shall incorporate by
reference an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") and forms of the
                                     -----------------
related letter of transmittal and any related summary advertisement (the
Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and such other documents, together with all
supplements and amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the
"Offer Documents"). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to correct
 ---------------
promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents that
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and
Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO,
as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and Merger Sub
shall give the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Offer Documents prior to such documents being filed with the SEC
or disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the
Company and its counsel with copies of any comments Parent, Merger Sub or their
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall provide the
Company and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
formulation of the response of Parent or Merger Sub to such comments.

     Section 2.2  Company Action. (a) The Company hereby approves of and
                  --------------
consents to the Offer and represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that
(i) the Board, at a meeting duly called and held on May 13, 2001, has
unanimously (A) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including each of the Offer and the Merger (the Offer and the Merger,
collectively, the "Transactions"), are fair to, and in the best interests of,
                   ------------
the holders of Shares, (B) approved, adopted and declared advisable this
Agreement and the Transactions (such approval and adoption having been made in
accordance with the DGCL, including, without limitation, Section 203 thereof
assuming that neither Parent nor Merger Sub are Interested Stockholders (as such
term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL with respect to the Transactions))
and (C) resolved to recommend that the holders of Shares accept the Offer and
tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer, and approve and adopt this Agreement
and the Transactions, and (ii) Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation ("CSFB")
                                                                        ----
has delivered to the Board its opinion that, as of the date of such opinion, the
consideration to be received by the holders of Shares pursuant to each of the
Offer and the Merger is fair to the holders of Shares from a financial point of
view (the "Fairness Opinion"), subject to the assumptions and qualifications
           ----------------
contained in such opinion. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the
Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Board described in the immediately
preceding sentence, and neither the Board nor the Company shall withdraw or
modify such recommendation in any manner adverse to Merger Sub or Parent except
as and to the extent expressly provided in Section 7.4(b).

     (b)  On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company
shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-
9 containing the

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

Fairness Opinion and, except and to the extent expressly provided in Section
7.4(b), the recommendation of the Board described in Section 2.2(a), and an
information statement (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the
"Schedule 14D-9"), and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the extent
 --------------
required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and any other
applicable federal securities laws. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees to correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 which shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to such
document being filed with the SEC or disseminated to holders of Shares. The
Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with copies of any comments the
Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 after the receipt of such comments and shall provide Parent and
its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of the
Company to such comments.

     (c)  The Company shall cooperate with and promptly furnish Parent and
Merger Sub with the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with
security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case
that are true and correct as of the most recent practicable date, together with
all other available listings and computer files containing names, addresses and
security position listings of record holders and Beneficial Owners of Shares.
The Company shall cooperate with and promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub with
such additional information, including, without limitation, updated listings and
computer files of stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings,
and such other assistance in disseminating the Offer Documents to holders of
Shares, as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request in connection with the
Offer. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps
as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub shall
hold in confidence the information contained in such labels, listings and files,
shall use such information only in connection with the Transactions, and, if
this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with Section 9.1, shall deliver
to the Company all copies of such information.

     Section 2.3  Directors.  (a) Effective upon the acceptance for payment
                  ---------
pursuant to the Offer of a number of Shares that satisfies the Minimum
Condition, Parent shall be entitled to designate that number of directors on the
Board, rounded up to the nearest whole number, on the Board equal to the product
of (i) the total number of directors on the Board (giving effect, if applicable,
to (A) the number of newly created directorships if the size of the Board is
increased pursuant to this Section 2.3(a) and (B) the number of vacancies if the
resignation of any director is secured pursuant to this Section 2.3(a)) and (ii)
the percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned in the aggregate by
Parent and Merger Sub bears to the total number of Shares outstanding, and the
Company, at such time, shall take all action necessary to cause Parent's
designees to be elected or appointed to the Board, including, without
limitation, increasing the number of directors, and seeking and accepting
resignations of incumbent directors. At such time, the Company also will use its
best efforts to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number
of members, rounded up to the nearest whole number, on (i) each committee of the
Board and (ii) the board of directors of each Subsidiary of

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

the Company (and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as
such individuals represent on the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that at
least two (2) members of the Board as of the date hereof who are not employees
of the Company (the "Continuing Directors") shall remain members of the Board
                     --------------------
until the Effective Time.

     (b)  The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the Board
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder. The Company, at its sole expense, shall take promptly all actions,
and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the

                        --------------------------
pursuant to the terms of the Sandpiper Networks, Inc. 1997 Stock Plan and
SoftAware, Inc. 1999 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan, outstanding rights to

Stock") shall be treated as follows:
-----

          (i)    Immediately prior to the completion of the Offer, each
     outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the
     Company Stock Option Plans (each, a "Company Stock Option") which,
                                          --------------------
     according to its terms would accelerate upon a "change in control" as
     defined in the Company Stock Option Plans or the applicable Company Stock
     Option Agreement, and which has an exercise price that is equal to or
     greater than the Per Share Amount, shall vest and become exercisable for
     all of the Shares subject to those Options and those Options shall be
     cancelled upon the completion

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

     of the Offer. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock
     Option which according to its terms would accelerate upon a "corporate
     transaction" as defined in the Company Stock Option Plans or the applicable
     Company Stock Option Agreement, which has an exercise price that is equal
     to or greater than the Per Share Amount, shall vest and become exercisable
     on an accelerated basis for all of the Shares subject to those Options and
     shall be cancelled at the Effective Time.

          (ii)   At the completion of the Offer, except as otherwise agreed upon
     in writing between a holder of a Company Stock Option ("Optionholder") and
                                                             ------------
     Parent, each Company Stock Option which, according to its terms would
     accelerate upon a "change in control" as defined in the Company Stock
     Option Plans or the applicable Company Stock Option Agreement, and which
     has an exercise price that is less than the Per Share Amount shall be
     cancelled and such cancellation shall not result in any acceleration of
     vesting or exercisability of such Company Stock Option due to a "change in
     control." Instead, each Optionholder shall be entitled to a cash payment
     per Option Share equal to the difference between the exercise price of the
     Optionholder's Company Stock Option and the Per Share Price (the
     "Cancellation Payment"). To the extent that the Optionholder's Company
      --------------------
     Stock Option was vested and exercisable in accordance with its terms
     immediately prior to completion of the Offer (without regard to any
     provisions for acceleration of vesting on a change in control), the
     Cancellation Payment shall be paid by Merger Sub to the Optionholder at the
     completion of the Offer upon surrender of the Company Stock Option. The
     remainder of the Cancellation Payment shall be made at such times as the
     Company Stock Option would have vested in accordance with its terms if it
     had continued in effect, provided that the Optionholder meets the terms and
     conditions of vesting set forth in the Company Stock Option Plans or the
     applicable Company Stock Option agreement.

          (iii)  At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed upon in
     writing between the Optionholder and Parent, each Company Stock Option
     which, according to its terms would accelerate upon a "corporate
     transaction" as defined in the Company Stock Option Plans or the applicable
     Company Stock Option Agreement, and which has an exercise price that is
     less than the Per Share Amount shall be cancelled and such cancellation
     shall not result in any acceleration of vesting or exercisability of such
     Company Stock Option due to a "corporate transaction." Instead, each holder
     of a cancelled Company Stock Option (each, an "Optionholder") shall be
                                                    ------------
     entitled to the Cancellation Payment. To the extent that the Optionholder's
     Company Stock Option was vested and exercisable in accordance with its
     terms immediately prior to cancellation (without regard to any provisions
     for acceleration of vesting on a change in control), the Cancellation
     Payment shall be paid by Parent to the Optionholder at the Effective Time
     upon surrender of the Company Stock Option. The remainder of the
     Cancellation Payment shall be made at such times as the Company Stock
     Option would have vested in accordance with its terms if it had continued
     in effect, provided that the Optionholder meets the terms and conditions of
     vesting set forth in the Company Stock Option Plans or the applicable
     Company Stock Option agreement.

          (iv)   The Company shall use its best efforts to provide all
     participants in the ESPP with at least ten (10) days written notice of
     consummation of the Offer and of their

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

     choice to (A) terminate their outstanding purchase rights and have all
     payroll deduction amounts refunded to them, or (B) let their outstanding
     purchase rights under the ESPP be exercised automatically on one final
     purchase date immediately prior to the consummation of the Offer. Each
     participant who elects to receive a refund of his or her payroll deductions
     shall promptly receive the cash equal to his or her payroll deductions for
     the final purchase interval. The ESPP shall terminate with the final
     purchase date, and no further purchase rights shall be granted under the
     terminated ESPP.

          (v)    Upon completion of the Offer, except as otherwise agreed upon
     in writing between the holder of Restricted Stock, (each, a "Restricted
                                                                  ----------
     Stockholder"), and the Company and Parent, the Restricted Stock issued and
     -----------
     outstanding immediately prior to the change in control shall be cancelled
     and forfeited, and such cancellation and forfeiture shall not result in any
     accelerated vesting of the Restricted Stock under the terms of the
     applicable Restricted Stock issuance agreement between the Restricted
     Stockholder and the Company due to a "change in control" or "corporate
     transaction". Instead, each Restricted Stockholder shall be entitled to
     receive a Cancellation Payment equal to the Per Share Amount multiplied by
     the number of shares of Restricted Stock he or she held immediately prior
     to the completion of the Offer. To the extent that the Restricted
     Stockholder's Restricted Stock was vested in accordance with its terms
     immediately prior to completion of the Offer (without regard to any
     provisions for accelerated vesting of the Restricted Stock on a change in
     control or corporate transaction), the Cancellation Payment shall be paid
     by Merger Sub to the Restricted Stockholder at the completion of the Offer.
     The remainder of the Cancellation Payment shall be made at such times as
     the Restricted Stock would have vested in accordance with the terms of the
     Restricted Stockholder's Restricted Stock issuance agreement if it such
     agreement had continued in effect, provided that the Restricted Stockholder
     meets the terms and conditions of vesting set forth in the Company Stock
     Option Plans and the applicable Restricted Stock issuance agreement.

          (vi)   Effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
     necessary action, including obtaining the consent of the individual
     Optionholders and Restricted Stockholders, if necessary, to (A) terminate
     the Company Stock Plans, (B) cancel, at the completion of the Offer or the
     Effective Time, as applicable, each outstanding Company Stock Option that
     is outstanding and unexercised, whether or not vested and exercisable as of
     such date, and (C) cancel at the consummation of the Offer, each
     Outstanding Restricted Share, whether or not vested as of such date.

          (vii)  All payments made pursuant to this Section 3.7 shall be subject
     to all applicable Tax withholding requirements.

          (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) obtain any consents from Optionholders and Restricted
Stockholders and (ii) make any amendments to the terms of such Company Stock
Options or the Company Stock Option Plans that are necessary or appropriate to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by Section 3.7(a).

     Section 3.8  Dissenting Shares.  (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this
                  -----------------
Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who shall have neither voted in
favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of DGCL (collectively,
the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into, or
     -----------------

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such stockholders
shall be entitled to receive, subject to and net of any applicable withholding
of Taxes, payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by them in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all
Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon,
upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 3.9, of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares.

     (b)  The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served on or otherwise received by the Company pursuant to the DGCL
and (ii) following acceptance of the Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer,
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably delayed or
withheld), make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

     Section 3.9  Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books.  (a) Prior to the
                  -----------------------------------------
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company to act as agent
(the "Paying Agent") for the purpose of exchanging certificates representing
      ------------
Shares for the payment of the Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares
shall become entitled pursuant to Section 3.6(a). At the Effective Time, Parent
will make available to the Paying Agent, in cash in the amount of the aggregate
Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to Section 3.6(a) in exchange for
outstanding Shares, and such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent provided, that such investments be in obligations of or
guaranteed by, the United States of America or any agency thereof and backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States of America, or in deposit
accounts, certificates of deposit or banker's acceptances of, repurchase or
reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased from,
United States commercial banks with capital surpluses and undivided profits
aggregating in excess of U.S. $1 billion.

     (b)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective
Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 3.6(a) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates evidencing such Shares (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon
                                          ------------
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of
transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor, subject to and net of any applicable
withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced
by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest
shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If the
payment equal to the

                                      -15-
<PAGE>

Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered certificate formerly evidencing Shares is registered on the
stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid
all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of Merger Sub that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

     (c)  Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying
Agent pursuant to Section 3.9(a) that remains unclaimed by holders of Shares one
hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent,
upon demand, and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the
Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by
them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share or Shares for any Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such Share or Shares to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law.

     (d)  At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law.

     (e)  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed before the Company has notice that the Certificate has been
acquired by a "protected purchaser" (as such term is defined in Section 8-303 of
the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code), and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate or the payment of the Merger
Consideration, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article III.

     (f)  Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause its agents to deduct and withhold, from the Per Share Amount or the Merger
Consideration or the appraised value contemplated by Section 3.8, as the case
may be, payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger or the
appraisal of their Shares, as contemplated by Section 3.8, as applicable, any
Taxes that are required to be so withheld or deducted under any applicable
provision of any Tax Law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent
or Merger Sub or their agents, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement and the Transactions as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made by Parent or Merger Sub or their agents.

qualified and each trust established in connection with any Plan which is
intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the
Code has received an opinion, advisory or modification letter from the IRS that
it is so exempt, and no fact or event has occurred since the date of such letter
or letters from the IRS that could reasonably be

                                      -22-

give rise to any such liability.

     (f)  All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with
respect to any Plan have been made on or before their due dates except when the
failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect. All such
contributions have been fully deducted for income tax purposes and no such
deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental Authority and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists which could reasonably
be expected to give rise to any such challenge or disallowance.

cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and the
Company shall notify Parent of the receipt of any comments of the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment
or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall provide to Parent
promptly copies of all correspondence between the Company or any representative
of the Company and the SEC with respect thereto. The Company shall give Parent
and its counsel the opportunity to review the Proxy Statement, including all
amendments and supplements thereto, prior to its being filed with the SEC and
shall give Parent and its counsel the opportunity to review all responses to
requests for additional information and replies to comments prior to their being
filed with, or sent to, the SEC. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, after consultation with the other
parties hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by the
SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement and all required amendments and supplements
thereto to be mailed to the holders of Shares entitled to vote at the
Stockholders' Meeting at the earliest practicable time.

     Section 7.3  Access to Information; Confidentiality.  (a) From the date
                  --------------------------------------
hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause the
Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, auditors, agents and other
representatives of the Company and the Subsidiaries to, afford the officers,
employees, representatives and agents of Parent and Merger Sub reasonable access
at all reasonable times to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices
and other facilities, books and records (including contracts and agreements) of
the Company and each Subsidiary, and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub with
such financial, operating and other data and information as Parent or Merger
Sub, through its officers, employees or agents, may reasonably request, provided
that the fulfillment of any such request shall not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the Company.

     (b)  All information obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Section 7.3 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the confidentiality
agreement, dated September 21, 2000 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between
                                          -------------------------
Parent and the Company.

     (c)  No investigation pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any

     Section 7.4  Acquisition Proposals.  (a) From the date hereof until the
                  ---------------------
termination hereof, the Company shall not and shall cause the Subsidiaries not
to, and shall use its best efforts to cause the officers, directors, employees
and other agents and advisors (including, without limitation, any investment
bank, attorney or accountant retained by the Company) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, (i) take any action to solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage or otherwise knowingly facilitate any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries, proposals or offers from any Person
(other than Parent or Merger Sub) relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any Subsidiary or
(iii) furnish any information to or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person that has made or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
intends to make an Acquisition Proposal except to

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

the extent the foregoing could not reasonably be expected to be relevant to an
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section
7.4(a) shall prohibit the Board from taking any action described in clause (iii)
above with respect to any Person that has made an unsolicited (as such term
relates to the period from and after the date hereof) bona fide written Superior
Proposal if, and only to the extent that, (A) the acceptance for payment of any
Shares pursuant to the Offer shall not have occurred, (B) the Board, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that such
action would, in the absence of the foregoing proscriptions, be required by its
fiduciary duties under the DGCL or its duties or obligations under other
applicable Law, and (C) prior to taking such action, the Company receives from
such Person an executed confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form
and in any event containing terms at least as stringent as those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement. Within twenty-four (24) hours after determining
to take any action described in clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the
Company shall notify Parent of any such Superior Proposal (including, without
limitation, the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the
Person making it), and shall thereafter inform Parent on a prompt basis of any
material changes to the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and, upon
the reasonable request of Parent, any material change to the status of any
discussion with such third party. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees and other agents and
advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated all discussions and negotiations, if any, that have taken place
prior to the date hereof with any parties with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of
Directors of the Company from complying with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that in connection
therewith the Company and the Board of Directors shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 7.4(b).

     (b)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Board
may not withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement, the Offer or the Merger unless the Board, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that such action is required by
its fiduciary duties under the DGCL or under other applicable Law; provided,
however, the Board may not approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal (or in
connection therewith, withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement, the Offer or the Merger) (including with respect to any statements
pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act) unless (i) the Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company has complied in all material
respects with the terms of this Section 7.4, (iii) it determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that such action is required
by its fiduciary duties under the DGCL or under other applicable Law and (iv)
the Company has negotiated, and the Board has determined to enter into, a
definitive agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal; and provided
further, (x) the Board in the twenty-four (24) hours subsequent to the
determination described in clause (iv) of the foregoing proviso shall have
notified Parent of such determination and of all the material terms and
conditions of such definitive agreement, (y) the Board shall be prohibited for a
period of three (3) calendar days after the date of receipt by Parent of such
notification from executing the definitive agreement relating to such Superior
Proposal and from approving or recommending such Superior Proposal (or, in
connection therewith, withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement, the Offer or the Merger) and during such three (3) day period Parent
shall be permitted to make any such adjustment to the terms and

                                      -34-
<PAGE>

conditions of this Agreement as Parent deems advisable (the "Adjusted
                                                             --------
Agreement") and (z) the Board determines that the Acquisition Proposal reflected
---------
by the definitive agreement is a Superior Proposal relative to the Adjusted
Agreement. In the event that the Board is permitted by the foregoing to approve
or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, it may terminate this Agreement. In the
event that the Board, pursuant to clause (z) of the second preceding sentence,
determines that the Acquisition Proposal reflected by the definitive agreement
is not a Superior Proposal relative to the Adjusted Agreement, the Company shall
execute an amendment to this Agreement to conform this Agreement to the Adjusted
Agreement and shall terminate all discussions with such other Person. The fact
that an Acquisition Proposal received by the Company after the date hereof is
determined by the Board not to be a Superior Proposal shall not affect the
rights and obligations of either Parent or the Company set forth in this Section
7.4 with respect to any subsequent Acquisition Proposal.

     Section 7.5  Employee Benefits Matters. (a) From and after the Effective
                  -------------------------
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to honor
in accordance with their terms, all contracts, agreements, arrangements,
policies, plans and commitments of the Company and the Subsidiaries with respect
to benefits or entitlements that accrued prior to the Effective Time that are
applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company or any
Subsidiary. Employees of the Company or any Subsidiary shall receive credit for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit
accruals) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or
maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries for service
accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any
Subsidiary, including credit for such service for purposes of determining any
amounts which subsequently become payable pursuant to the provisions of Section
3.7(a); provided, however, that such crediting of service shall not operate to
duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit and provided, further
that in determining the amount of vacation pay owed to any such Company employee
from and after the Effective Time under the applicable terms of the vacation
plan of the Surviving Corporation, credit shall be given for such employee's
service with the Company or any Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time.

     (b)  With respect to any employee benefit plans in which any employees of
the Company or any Subsidiary first become eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time or in which the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary
did not participate prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall: (i) waive all
pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the employees of the
Company or any Subsidiary under any such plans in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent such pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
analogous plan prior to the Effective Time; (ii) provide each employee of the
Company and the Subsidiaries with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent such credit was given under
the analogous plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket co-payment requirements under any such new plan in
which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time;
and (iii) with respect to flexible spending accounts, provide each employee of
the Company and its subsidiaries with a credit for any salary reduction
contributions made thereto and a debit for any expenses incurred thereunder with
respect to the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs; provided, that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in duplications of
benefits.

                  -----------------                        -----------
Parties"), to the fullest extent permitted by Law, with respect to any claim,

compromise, cost or expense (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal
counsel), whenever asserted or claimed, based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, any facts or circumstances occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the
Effective Time, including liability arising under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act or state Law.

     (b)  Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in
effect for not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries on the date hereof (provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers
having at least the same coverage and amounts thereof and containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the persons currently covered by
such policies as the insured) with respect to facts or circumstances occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time. Parent agrees to pay all expenses (including
fees and expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
successfully enforcing the indemnity or other obligations under this Section
7.6.

     (c)  Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and any of its
Subsidiaries (or their successors) to maintain in effect for a period of six (6)
years provisions in its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or equivalent
organizational documents providing for indemnification and exculpation of
Indemnified Parties, with respect to facts or circumstances occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, to the extent set forth in the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws as of the date hereof; provided that
the foregoing shall not in any way restrict or preclude any sale, liquidation or
dissolution of any Subsidiary of Parent (including the Surviving Corporation) at
any time after the Effective Time.

     (d)  The rights under this Section 7.6 shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are expressly intended to benefit each Indemnified Party.

     Section 7.7   Notification of Certain Matters.  The Company shall give
                   -------------------------------
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of
(a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-

warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, (b) any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may
be, to comply with, perform or satisfy in any material respect any covenant or
agreement to be complied with, performed or satisfied by it hereunder, (c) any
notice or other communication received from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, (d)
any notice or other communication received from any Governmental Authority in
connection with or relating to the Transactions and (e) any Action commenced or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting the Company or any Subsidiary which, if pending on the date
of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Section 4.9 or

                                      -36-
<PAGE>

which relate to the consummation of the Transactions; provided, however, that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.

     Section 7.8   Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.  (a) Upon the terms
                   ---------------------------------------
and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall (i) make
promptly its respective filings, if any, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, if any, under the HSR Act, the Fair Trading Act, the E.C. Merger
Regulation or any other applicable foreign antitrust law with respect to the
Transactions and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the Transactions, including, without limitation,
using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all Permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities and
parties to contracts with the Company and the Subsidiaries as are necessary for
the consummation of the Transactions and to fulfill the conditions to the Offer
and the Merger; provided that neither Parent nor Merger Sub will be required by
this Section 7.8 to (A) prohibit or limit the ownership or operation by the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries of any business or
assets of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries or compel
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries, as a result of the
Transactions, to dispose of or to hold separate any business or assets of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries or (B) divest any
Shares which, in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B) of this Section 7.8(a),
has an economic detriment to Parent or the Company that is material in relation
to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement shall use their reasonable best efforts to take all such action.

consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or the
rules or regulations of any United States or foreign securities exchange, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

                   ---------
amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their
respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that, after consummation of the Offer no amendment may be
made that would reduce the amount or change the type of consideration into which
each Share shall be converted upon consummation of the Merger. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed Parent and the
Company.

     Section 9.5   Waiver.  Subject to Section 2.3, at any time prior to the
                   ------
Effective Time, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of
any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy
in the representations and warranties of any other party contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any
agreement of any other party or any condition to its own obligations contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The
failure or any party hereto to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of any such provision, or
in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the
right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision.

                   ----------------------------
Confidentiality Agreement and the Parent Note constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede all prior agreements, negotiations and undertakings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by
operation of law or otherwise), except that Parent and Merger Sub may assign all
or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of Parent,
provided that (i) no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its
obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations and
(ii) the assignee is able to make and makes for the benefit of the Company
pursuant to a written instrument delivered to the Company the representation and
warranty set forth in Section 5.6 (which representation shall be deemed to be
part of this Agreement).

     Section 10.4  Parties in Interest.  This Agreement shall be binding upon
                   -------------------
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this

     Section 10.5  Specific Performance.  The parties hereto agree that
                   --------------------
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other
remedy at law or equity.

     Section 10.6  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by, and
                   -------------
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in any Delaware state or federal court. The parties
hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware for the purpose of any Action arising out
of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b)
irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above-
named courts.

     Section 10.7  Waiver of Jury Trial.  Each of the parties hereto hereby
                   --------------------
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may have
to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of
the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and
(b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into
this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 10.7.

                                                                         -------

                            CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER
                            -----------------------

     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, but subject to the terms
of Section 2.1, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or to pay
for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, if (i) immediately prior to the
expiration of the Offer, the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied,
(ii) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, the Fair Trading Act, the

have expired or been terminated prior to the expiration of the Offer or (iii) at
any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the expiration of
the Offer, any of the following conditions shall exist (other than as a result
of any action or inaction of Parent or Merger Sub that constitutes a breach of
this Agreement):

         (a)  there shall have been instituted or be pending any Action by any
     Governmental Authority (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal, delay,
     or otherwise, directly or indirectly, restrain or prohibit or increase the

     by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent, or the consummation
     of any other Transaction, or seeking to obtain damages in connection with
     any Transaction; (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit the ownership or
     operation by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries
     of any business or assets of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of
     their Subsidiaries or to compel the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of
     their Subsidiaries, as a result of the Transactions, to dispose of or to
     hold separate any business or assets of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or
     any of their Subsidiaries; (iii) seeking to impose or confirm any
     limitation on the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of
     Parent to exercise effectively full rights of ownership of any Shares,
     including, without limitation, the right to vote any Shares acquired by
     Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer or otherwise on all matters properly
     presented to the Company's stockholders, including, without limitation, the
     approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions; or (iv)
     seeking to require divestiture by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate
     of Parent of any Shares which, in the case of each of clauses (i) through
     (iv) of this paragraph (a) has an economic detriment to Parent or the
     Company that is material in relation to the Company and its Subsidiaries
     taken as a whole;

         (b)  there shall have been any statute, rule, regulation, legislation
     or interpretation enacted, promulgated, amended, issued or deemed
     applicable to (i) Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of
     Parent or the Company or (ii) any Transaction, by any United States or
     foreign legislative body or Governmental Authority with appropriate
     jurisdiction, other than the routine application of the waiting period
     provisions of the HSR Act, the Fair Trading Act, the E.C. Merger Regulation
     or any other applicable foreign antitrust law to the Offer or the Merger,
     that is reasonably likely to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the
     consequences referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of paragraph (a)
     above;

         (c)  (i) the Board, or any committee thereof, shall have withdrawn or
     modified, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or
     recommendation of the Offer, the Merger, the Agreement, or approved or
     recommended any Acquisition

                                      A-1
<PAGE>

     Proposal or any other acquisition of Shares other than the Offer, the
     Merger or (ii) the Board, or any committee thereof, shall have resolved to
     do any of the foregoing;

         (d)  any Material Adverse Change;

         (e)  any representation or warranty of the Company in the Agreement (i)
     that is qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall not be
     true and correct in any respect as so qualified or (ii) that is not
     qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall not be true and
     correct in all material respects, except to the extent the effect of any
     such breach, either individually or in the aggregate with all such other
     breaches, would not have a Material Adverse Effect;

         (f)  the Company shall have failed to perform, in any material respect,
     any obligation or to comply, in any material respect, with any material
     agreement or covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by it
     under the Agreement;

         (g)  the Agreement shall have been terminated by Parent or the Company
     in accordance with its terms; or

         (h)  there shall have occurred and be continuing (i) any general
     suspension of trading in, or limitation on prices for, securities on a
     national securities exchange in the United States (excluding any
     coordinated trading halt triggered solely as a result of a specified
     increase or decrease in a market index or similar "circuit breaker"
     process) which materially and adversely affects the extension of credit in
     the United States, the United Kingdom or the European Union generally by
     banks or other lending institutions, (ii) a declaration of a banking
     moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United
     States, the United Kingdom or the European Union generally which materially
     and adversely affects the extension of credit in the United States, the
     United Kingdom or the European Union generally by banks or other lending
     institutions, (iii) any newly initiated material limitation (whether
     mandatory or not) by any Governmental Authority on, or other similar event
     that materially and adversely affects, the extension of credit in the
     United States, the United Kingdom or the European Union generally by banks
     or other lending institutions or (iv) a commencement of a war or armed
     hostilities or other national or international calamity directly or
     indirectly involving the United States, the United Kingdom or the European
     Union generally which materially and adversely affects the extension of
     credit in the United States, the United Kingdom or the European Union
     generally by banks or other lending institutions, and in the case of
     clauses (i) through (iv) of this paragraph (h), as a result thereof,
     notwithstanding Parent's reasonable best efforts, Parent's ability to
     access the Funds or to effect payment therewith for the Shares is
     materially and adversely affected,

which in the judgment of Parent in any such case, makes it inadvisable to
proceed with such acceptance for payment of or payment for the Shares or to
proceed with the Merger.

     The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Merger Sub and Parent
and may be asserted by Merger Sub or Parent regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to any such condition or may be waived by Merger Sub or Parent in
whole or in part at any time and from


                                      A-2
<PAGE>

time to time in their sole discretion; provided, that, Merger Sub and Parent may
not avail themselves of any such condition at any time during which either
Merger Sub or Parent is in breach in any material respect of any of its
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the Agreement to the
extent (and only to the extent) such breach causes the failure of the Minimum
Condition or any of the conditions set forth in this Annex A. The failure by
                                                     -------
Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall
not be deemed a waiver of any such right; the waiver of any such right with
respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver
with respect to any other facts and circumstances; and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

     Capitalized terms used in this Annex A shall have the respective meanings
                                    -------
set forth in the Agreement to which it is annexed.

Up to $345,000,000                                              __________, 2001
                                                       San Francisco, California


          FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Digital Island, Inc., a Delaware corporation
having its principal offices at 45 Fremont Street, San Francisco, CA. 94105
("Borrower"), hereby promises to pay to Cable and Wireless plc, a corporation
organized and existing under the laws of England  having its principal offices
at 124 Theobalds Road, London, England ("Lender"), the principal amount of
[___________________ (US$____________)], to the holder of this Promissory Note,
two hundred seventy (270) days after the date hereof, together with interest on
the principal amount hereof outstanding from time to time.  Interest on this
Promissory Note shall be calculated based on a year of 365 or 366 days (as the
case may be) and actual days elapsed, and shall be payable monthly on the 15th
day of each calendar month commencing with the 15th day of the calendar month
next following the last day of the Initial Interest Period (as defined below)
(or if such day is not a Business Day then on the next succeeding Business Day)
for the Interest Period ending on the last day of the preceding month, and on
the day when any principal payment or pre-payment is made with respect to the
amount then paid or prepaid for the portion of the Interest Period ending on the
date of payment or prepayment, at the rate of interest per annum equal (to the
full extent permitted by applicable law) to the Applicable Rate (as defined
below); provided, however, that upon the occurrence and during the continuance
        -----------------
of any default by the Borrower in the payment of any amount due under this
Promissory Note, interest shall, to the full extent permitted by law, thereafter
accrue (as well after as before judgment) on such overdue amount at a rate equal
to six (6) percentage points above the rate of interest otherwise specified
herein.  Interest shall be payable in respect of the principal amount borrowed
hereunder for the first day of such borrowing, but not for the day on which such
principal amount is repaid.

          In no contingency or event whatsoever shall the aggregate of all
amounts deemed interest under this Promissory Note charged or collected exceed
the highest rate permissible under any applicable law which a court of competent
jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto. In the
event that such a court determines that amounts that the Lender has charged or
received that are deemed to be interest hereunder exceed the highest applicable
rate, the rate in effect hereunder shall automatically be reduced to the maximum
rate permitted by applicable law and the Lender shall at the Lender's option (i)
promptly refund to the Borrower any amounts that are deemed to be interest and
received by the Lender in excess of the maximum lawful
<PAGE>

rate or (ii) shall apply such excess to the principal balance of this Promissory
Note. It is the intent hereof that the Borrower not pay or contract to pay, and
that the Lender not receive or contract to receive, directly or indirectly in
any manner whatsoever, any amounts that are deemed to be interest in excess of
that which may be paid by the Borrower under applicable law.

          As used in this Promissory Note, the following terms shall have
the following meanings:

          "Applicable Rate" shall mean for each Interest Period the discount
          rate for 30-day non-financial commercial paper A2/P2 appearing on the

          www.federalreserve.gov/releases/cp/ webpage at 11:30 a.m., New York
          Time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the first day of such
          Interest Period, or if such webpage is not available on such day then
          the rate for 30-day Non-Financial Commercial Paper - Medium Grade
          (A2/P2)  as it appears in the most recent weekly Federal Reserve Board
          H.15 Statistical Release.

          "Business Day" shall mean a day on which banks are not required or
          authorized to close in San Francisco, California, U.S.A., New York,
          New York, U.S.A. or London, England, U.K.

          "Initial Interest Period" shall mean the period commencing on the date
          of this Promissory Note and ending on the last day of the next
          following calendar month.

          "Interest Period" shall mean the Initial Interest Period and,
          thereafter, each calendar month during the term of this Promissory
          Note.

          "U. S. Dollars" and US$" shall mean lawful currency of the United
          States of America.

          All payments to the holder of this Promissory Note shall be made at
the address of the holder set forth in the first paragraph of this Promissory
Note, ATTENTION: Treasurer, or at such other office or to such account as such
holder from time to time may specify by notice to the Borrower.

          This Promissory Note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time
and from time to time upon not less than one Business Day's notice to the holder
without premium or penalty.

          The Borrower shall pay to the holder of this Promissory Note all
overdue amounts of principal and interest as may become due hereunder at the
rate provided for herein.  The Borrower shall pay to the holder of this
Promissory Note all costs and


                                       2
<PAGE>

expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred
by such holder in connection with enforcement and collection of this Promissory
Note.

          The obligation of the Borrower to pay the holder of this Promissory

from time to time may specify by written notice to the Borrower).

          No failure by the holder of this Promissory Note to assert any of its
rights or take any action hereunder, nor any delay therein, shall constitute a
waiver of such holder's rights hereunder.  The rights and remedies provided in
this Promissory Note are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by law.  No waiver of any such rights shall be effective unless made in
a writing signed by the holder of this Promissory Note and then shall be
