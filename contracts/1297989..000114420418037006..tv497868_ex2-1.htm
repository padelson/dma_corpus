NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual
covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties, each
intending to be legally bound, do hereby agree as follows:

  



  

1. _THE MERGER_.

  



  

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
Cayman Companies Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company,
with the Company continuing as the surviving company in the Merger and a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer (as the surviving company after the Effective
Time, the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease. The Merger shall be effected pursuant to the provisions of,
and shall have the effects provided in, this Agreement and Part XVI of the
Cayman Companies Law.

  



  

1.2 _Effective Time_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Buyer, Merger Sub and
the Company shall cause (a) a plan of merger substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Plan of Merger_ ") and (b) other
documents required to effect the Merger to be executed, delivered and filed
with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands (the " _Registrar_ ")
as provided in Part XVI of the Cayman Companies Law. The Merger shall
become effective on the date when the Plan of Merger is registered by the
Registrar, or on such later date (being not later than the 90th day after the
date of such registration) as specified in Section 3.1 of the Plan of Merger
in accordance with the Cayman Companies Law (the " _Effective Time_ "). From
and after the Effective Time, all of the rights, privileges and powers of
each of the Company and Merger Sub, and all property, real, personal and
mixed, and all debts due to any of the Company and Merger Sub, as well as all
other things and causes of action belonging to the Company and Merger Sub,
shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall thenceforth attach to the
Surviving Corporation, and may be enforced against it to the same extent as
if said debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred or contracted by
it, all as provided under the Cayman Companies Law.

  



  

1.3 _The Memorandum and Articles of Association_. At the Effective
Time, the memorandum and articles of association of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the memorandum and
articles of association of the Surviving Corporation (except that, at the
Effective Time, the memorandum and articles of association of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended to show the name of the Surviving Corporation as
"SCIOinspire Holdings, Inc." (as so amended, the " _Memorandum of
Association_ ") until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

  



  

1.4 _Directors, Managers and Officers of the Surviving
Corporation_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall become the directors of the Surviving Corporation (and any other
director of the Company shall cease to be a director at the Effective Time),
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.
The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
become the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
resignations or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be (and any other officer
of the Company shall cease to be a director at the Effective Time).

  



  

   

 | -2-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

1.5 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in Article 6 and Article 7, the closing of the
Contemplated Transactions (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices
of Buyer's counsel at such time and place as the Parties may agree, but in
any event within three (3) Business Days after the last of the conditions set
forth in Article 6 and Article 7 are satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions). Subject to the
provisions of Article 8, failure to consummate the Merger on the date and
time and at the place determined pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall not result
in the termination of this Agreement and shall not relieve any Party of any
obligation under this Agreement. The Closing may be consummated electronically
by the exchange of executed counterparts of, and the delivery of all
deliverables required pursuant to, this Agreement in portable document
format (PDF).

  



  

1.6 _Conversion of Equity_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Shareholders:

  



  

(a) _Conversion of the Shares_. At the Effective Time, each Share
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive (i) with
respect to Series C-1 Preference Shares, an amount equal to the Series C-1
Per Share Merger Consideration and (ii) with respect to Shares other than
Series C-1 Preference Shares, the sum of (A) the Closing Per Share Merger
Consideration and (B) the aggregate portion, if any, of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Working Capital Escrow
Amount, the Shareholders' Representative Fund Amount and the XL
Health Receivables Consideration, in each case paid in respect of such Shares
at the times set forth and in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement (the amounts in clauses (A) and (B) collectively being referred to
herein as the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). All such Shares when so
converted shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Series C-1 Per Share Merger
Consideration or the Per Share Merger Consideration, as applicable, with
respect to each such Share upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance
with this Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury and Other Shares_. Each Share held in
the treasury of the Company and each Share owned or held, directly or
indirectly, by the Company, any of the Company's Subsidiaries, Buyer or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (including the Rollover
Shares), in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
canceled and retired without any conversion thereof and no payment of cash or
any other distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  



  

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Merger, be converted into the right to receive one (1) fully paid and non-
assessable share of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

   

 | -3-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) _Treatment of Options_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
take all actions necessary so that all options to purchase shares of
the Company then outstanding (the " _Options_ ") shall become fully vested
and exercisable (whether or not currently exercisable) and, at the Effective
Time, each Option not theretofore exercised shall be cancelled upon the
Closing (the " _Option Cancellation_ ") without any future liability to
Buyer, the Company or any other Person, and each holder of an Option that is
cancelled shall, in respect of each such Option, be entitled to receive (i)
at, or as soon as practicable after, the Closing a cash payment in an amount
equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of subtracting (x) the
applicable Exercise Price of such Option from (y) the Closing Per Share
Merger Consideration, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Common Stock
underlying such holder's Options (such product, the " _Closing Option
Consideration_ ") and (ii) the aggregate portion, if any, of the Indemnity
Escrow Amount, the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Working Capital Escrow
Amount, the Shareholders' Representative Fund Amount and any XL Health
Receivables Consideration, in each case paid in respect of such Option at the
times set forth and in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
(the amounts in clauses (i) and (ii) collectively being referred to herein as
the " _Option Consideration_ " with respect to such Option). The
Company shall be entitled to, and shall, deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise payable to any holder of Options (each an " _Optionholder_
") pursuant to this Section 1.6(d) such amounts (the " _Withholding Amounts_
") as the Company is required to deduct and withhold in connection with the
Option Cancellation or with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any provision of any state, local or other U.S. or non-U.S. Tax law
and to properly remit such amount to the appropriate Taxing authority, as set
forth in Section 1.11. To the extent that any Withholding Amounts are so
deducted and withheld by the Company, such Withholding Amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement in accordance with Section 1.11.

  



  

1.7 _Payment of the Closing Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
appoint a nationally recognized financial institution selected by the
Company with Buyer's approval (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to act as paying agent
for the payment of the consideration due to the Shareholders as contemplated
by Section 1.6. The terms of appointment of the Paying Agent shall be
reasonably acceptable to Buyer. At or prior to the Closing, Buyer and Merger
Sub shall, in accordance with and subject to Section 1.7(b), deposit, or
cause to be deposited, an amount equal to the Closing Merger Consideration
less the Aggregate Closing Option Consideration and less the Excluded Shares
Closing Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
Shareholders (other than with respect to Excluded Shares), by wire transfer
of immediately available funds. Such amount shall be held in one or more
segregated accounts in trust for the benefit of the Shareholders (other than
with respect to Excluded Shares) for the sole purpose of payment of each
Shareholder's portion of the Closing Merger Consideration to such Shareholder
(other than with respect to Excluded Shares) hereunder, and such amount shall
not be subject to any Encumbrance, attachment, trustee process or any other
judicial process of any creditor of any party. Any interest on funds held by
the Paying Agent shall be for the benefit of the Surviving Corporation and
shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation upon request or within two Business
Days after payment of all funds required to be paid to Shareholders
hereunder.

  



  

(b) _Procedures and Payments by Paying Agent or the Company_.

  



  

(i) Not later than seven Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company and the Paying Agent shall deliver to each Securityholder (other
than with respect to Excluded Shares) a letter of transmittal (each, a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit C_
hereto, with such additional changes as the Paying Agent may request and as
may be reasonably agreed among Buyer and the Company prior to the Closing.

  



  

   

 | -4-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) Upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with its instructions, to the Paying
Agent, such Shareholder (other than with respect to Excluded Shares) shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefore, and the Paying Agent shall pay to
such Shareholder, the amount to which such Shareholder is entitled pursuant to
Section 1.6 (other than with respect to Excluded Shares) no later than two
(2) Business Days following receipt by the Paying Agent of such duly
completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal (or, if later, the
Closing Date). At the Effective Time, in accordance with Section 1.6, all of
the Shares shall be canceled and no longer be outstanding and the Register of
Members of the Company (the " _Register of Members_ ") shall be updated
accordingly, and each holder of Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive that portion of the Closing
Merger Consideration to which such Shareholder is entitled hereunder, plus in
the case of Shares other than Series C-1 Preference Shares, any portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Working
Capital Escrow Amount, the Shareholders' Representative Fund Amount and any XL
Health Receivables Consideration if and when paid to Shareholders at the
times set forth in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the portion of the Closing
Merger Consideration payable to the Shareholders. Payment of the applicable
portion of the Closing Merger Consideration to any Shareholder shall be made
from the funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 1.7(a).

  



  

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall pay to
the Surviving Corporation the portion of the Closing Merger Consideration, if
any, that remains undistributed on the date that is one year after the Closing
Date. Any Shareholder that has not theretofore delivered a duly completed and
validly executed Letter of Transmittal shall, following such date, look only
to the Surviving Corporation for payment of any consideration to which such
Shareholder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any Shareholder for any portion of the Closing Merger Consideration

provided, however, that by conducting its review, Buyer shall not be deemed

Capital or Final Closing Net Working Capital Statement; and provided further,

 | -7-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(B) _Objection_. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
Shareholders' Representative may object to the Final Closing Net
Working Capital Statement by delivering to Buyer a written statement setting
forth Shareholders' Representative's objections in reasonable detail,
indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for Shareholders'
Representative's disagreement therewith (the " _Objections Statement_ "). If
Shareholders' Representative fails to deliver the Objections Statement before
the expiration of the Review Period, the Final Closing Net Working Capital
Statement and the Final Closing Net Working Capital, Final Closing Cash,
Final Closing Indebtedness and Final Closing Company Expenses stated therein
shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties. If Shareholders'
Representative delivers the Objections Statement before the expiration of the
Review Period, then any element of Buyer's Final Closing Net Working Capital
Statement that is not in dispute on the date such Objections Statement is
given shall be treated as final and binding, and Buyer and Shareholders'
Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections
within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Objections Statement (the "
_Resolution Period_ "). If any or all of the objections raised in the
Objections Statement are resolved within the Resolution Period, the Final
Closing Net Working Capital, Final Closing Cash, Final Closing Indebtedness,
Final Closing Company Expenses and the Final Closing Net Working Capital
Statement with such changes as are agreed upon in writing by Buyer and
Shareholders' Representative shall be final and binding on the Parties.

  



  

(iv) _Resolution of Disputes_.

  



  

(A) _Disputes_. If Shareholders' Representative and Buyer fail to
reach an agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in
the Objections Statement before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any
items or amounts remaining in dispute (" _Disputed Amounts_ ") shall be
submitted for resolution to an impartial nationally recognized firm of
independent certified public accountants that is mutually agreed upon by
Buyer and Shareholders' Representative (the " _Independent Accountant_ ") who
shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only and make any resulting adjustments to
the Final Closing Net Working Capital, Final Closing Cash, Final Closing
Indebtedness, Final Closing Company Expenses and the Final Closing Net Working
Capital Statement. The Parties agree that all adjustments shall be made
without regard to materiality. The Independent Accountant shall only decide
the specific amounts under dispute and its decision for each Disputed Amount
must be within the range of values assigned thereto in the Final Closing Net
Working Capital Statement and the Objections Statement, respectively.

  



  

(B) _Fees of the Independent Accountant_. The fees, costs, and
expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated to, and be
borne by, Buyer and the Shareholders' Representative based on the inverse of
the percentage that the Independent Accountant's determination (before such
allocation) bears to the total amount in dispute as originally submitted to
the Independent Accountant. For example, if the amount in dispute totals
$10,000 and the Independent Accountant awards $6,000 in favor of the
Shareholders' Representative position, sixty percent (60%) of the costs of
its review would be borne by Buyer and forty percent (40%) of the costs would
be borne by the Shareholders' Representative.

  



  

   

 | -8-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(C) _Determination by Independent Accountant_. The Independent
Accountant shall make a determination in writing as soon as practicable within
thirty (30) days (or such other time as Buyer and Shareholders'
Representative may agree in writing) after its engagement, and its resolution
of the Disputed Amounts and its adjustments to the Final Closing Net Working
Capital, Final Closing Cash, Final Closing Indebtedness, Final Closing
Company Expenses, Final Closing Cash and the Final Closing Net Working Capital
Statement shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties.

  



  

(v) _Determination and Payment of the Net Adjustment Amount_. If
the Net Adjustment Amount is a positive number, Buyer shall within five (5)
Business Days pay to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the
Securityholders (other than with respect to the Dissenting Shares) in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages (with amounts payable to
the Optionholders to be made to the Company for further payment to the
Optionholders through the Company's payroll system), by electronic wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Net
Adjustment Amount. If the Net Adjustment Amount is a negative number, such
amount shall be paid to Buyer within five (5) Business Days, first by
distribution from the Working Capital Escrow Amount and, in the event the
Working Capital Escrow Amount is insufficient, any remaining amount by
distribution from the Indemnity Escrow Amount. To the extent the deficiency
referred to in the immediately preceding sentence exceeds the Indemnity Escrow
Amount then remaining, no further payments shall be required in respect of
such excess. Promptly following final resolution of the Net Adjustment Amount
and completion of any payments required to be paid by the Securityholders
pursuant to this Section 1.8(c)(v), any remaining portion of the
Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be released to the Paying Agent for
further distribution to the Securityholders (other than with respect to
Dissenting Shares) in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages
(with amounts payable to the Optionholders to be made to the Company for
further payment to the Optionholders through the Company's payroll system).

  



  

(d) _Adjustments for Tax Purposes_. Any payments made pursuant to
clause 1.8(c) shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration by the parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
Law.

9.2 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) _By the Securityholders_. Subject to the limitations set forth

severally (in accordance with its Pro Rata Percentage), and not jointly,
indemnify, defend, and hold Buyer, Merger Sub and each of their Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company and the Subsidiaries) and their
respective Representatives, equity owners, successors, and assigns (each, a "
_Buyer Indemnified Person_ "), harmless from and against and shall reimburse
each Buyer Indemnified Person for any and all Claims, Taxes, assessments,
Liabilities, damages, losses, deficiencies, and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees, experts' fees, and expenses of suit (including
travel expenses and discovery costs)) (collectively, " _Damages_ "), whether
or not involving, arising from, or related to a Third-Party Claim, incurred
or suffered by or threatened against any Buyer Indemnified Person as a result
of, arising out of, or directly or indirectly relating to any of the
following:

  



  

(i) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty
made by the Company in this Agreement (whether or not contained in Article
2);

  



  

(ii) any breach or violation of any covenant, obligation, or
agreement of the Company in or pursuant to this Agreement prior to the
Closing;

  



  

(iii) any claim for appraisal of Dissenting Shares for an amount in
excess of or pursuant to the right to receive a portion of the
applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (provided that such Damages shall be net of the applicable merger
consideration that would otherwise be payable pursuant to Section 1.6 if such
Shares were not Dissenting Shares);

  



  

(iv) Pre-Closing Taxes;

  



  

(v) the misclassification of any service provider of the Company or
its Subsidiaries as an independent contractor rather than as an
employee, including any related Taxes, in each case for the period on or
prior to the Closing Date; and

  



  

(vi) the allocation of the merger consideration among all
Securityholders set forth in the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital
Statement.

  



  

(b) _By Buyer_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article 9, Buyer shall, from and after the Closing, indemnify, defend, and
hold the Securityholders and each of their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives, equity owners, successors, and assigns (each, a "
_Securityholder Indemnified Person_ "), harmless from and against and shall
reimburse each Securityholder Indemnified Person for any and all Damages,
whether or not involving, arising from, or related to a Third-Party Claim,
incurred or suffered by or threatened against any Securityholder Indemnified
Person as a result of, arising out of, or directly or indirectly relating to
any of the following:

  



   

 | -43-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty
made by Buyer or Merger Sub in this Agreement (whether or not contained in
Article 3); and

  



  

(ii) any breach or violation of any covenant, obligation, or
agreement of Buyer or Merger Sub in or pursuant to this Agreement prior
to the Closing.

  



  

(c) _Notice of Claim_. Notice in respect of any claim for
indemnification hereunder must specify in reasonable detail the factual
basis of the claim. All claims for indemnification pursuant to this Section
9.2 must be brought at or prior to expiration of the applicable time period
set forth in Section 9.1 in order for the obligation of the indemnifying party
to provide indemnification under this Section 9.2 to be triggered.

  



  

(d) _Certain Damages; Determination of Damages_. In no event shall
any Buyer Indemnified Person or Securityholder Indemnified Person
seeking indemnification under this Article 9 (as applicable, each a "
_Claimant_ ") be entitled to any punitive, incidental, consequential,
special, or indirect damages, including loss of future revenue or income, loss
of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged
breach of this Agreement, or diminution of value or any damages based on any
type of multiple. For the purposes of this Article 9 only, when determining
the amount of any Damages that are the subject matter of a claim
for indemnification hereunder for breach of any representation or warranty,
each representation and warranty contained in this Agreement (other than the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.9) shall be read without
regard and without giving effect to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect
or similar standard or qualification contained in such representation or
warranty (as if such standard or qualification were deleted from such
representation and warranty).

  



  

(e) _Other Sources of Recovery_. Damages shall be limited to the
amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any
insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution, or other similar payment
actually received by any Claimant in respect of any such claim. The Claimant
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance
policies or indemnity, contribution, or other similar agreements for any
Damages. If any such recovery is obtained after the Claimant has received any
payment from the Securityholders hereunder, the Claimant shall promptly
refund such amount to the extent it would result in duplicate recovery for
the same Damages.

  



  

(f) _Tax Benefits_. Damages shall be reduced by an amount equal to
any Tax benefit actually realized as a result of such Damages by a Claimant
in the year such Damages were incurred or in the subsequent Tax year,
calculated on a "with and without" basis.

  



  

(g) _Mitigation_. Each Claimant shall take, and cause its
Affiliates to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages upon becoming
aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or
does, give rise thereto.

  



  

(h) _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Article 9, the indemnification by Securityholders of
Buyer Indemnified Persons provided for in Section 9.2(a) of this Agreement
and the indemnification by Buyer of Securityholder Indemnified Persons
provided for in Section 9.2(b) shall be subject to the following limitations
and conditions:

  



  

   

 | -44-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) _Indemnification Threshold Amount_. Neither any Buyer
Indemnified Persons nor any Securityholder Indemnified Persons shall be
entitled to indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i) (other than for breaches
or inaccuracies of the Tax Representations, the Contractor Representations
or the Company Fundamental Representations) or Section 9.2(b)(i) (other than
for breaches or inaccuracies of Buyer Fundamental Representations), as
applicable, until the aggregate amount of all of Buyer Indemnified Persons'
Damages or Securityholder Indemnified Persons' Damages, as the case may be,
exceeds $600,000 (the " _Indemnification Threshold Amount_ "); provided,
however, that, once the aggregate amount of all of Buyer Indemnified Persons'
Damages or Securityholder Indemnified Persons' Damages, as the case may be,
reaches the Indemnification Threshold Amount, Buyer Indemnified Persons or
Securityholder Indemnified Persons, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
recover the total amount of Damages exceeding the Indemnification Threshold
Amount.

  



  

(ii) _Cap Amount_. The maximum aggregate amount which Buyer
Indemnified Persons may be entitled to receive pursuant to claims for
indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i) (other than for breaches or
inaccuracies of the Company Fundamental Representations, the Tax
Representations, or the Contractor Representations) and Section 9.2(a)(ii)
(other than for willful or intentional breach) shall be the Indemnity Escrow
Amount held in the Escrow Account. The maximum aggregate amount which
Securityholder Indemnified Persons may be entitled to receive pursuant to
claims for indemnification under Section 9.2(b)(i) (other than for breaches or
inaccuracies of the Buyer Fundamental Representations) and Section 9.2(b)(ii)
(other than for willful or intentional breach) shall be an amount equal
to the Indemnity Escrow Amount. The maximum aggregate amount which Buyer
Indemnified Persons may be entitled to receive pursuant to claims for
indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(iv), Section 9.2(a)(v), and for breach of
or inaccuracy of the Tax Representations and the Contractor Representations,
as applicable, shall be an amount equal to the Special Indemnity Escrow
Amount. Subject to the other limitations in this Article 9 (including the
preceding sentences of this Section 9.2(h)(ii)), the maximum aggregate
amount which Buyer Indemnified Persons may be entitled to receive pursuant to
claims for indemnification under Section 9.2(a) shall be the merger
consideration received by Securityholders under this Agreement. Subject to the
other limitations in this Article 9 (including the preceding sentences of
this Section 9.2(h)(ii), the maximum aggregate amount which Securityholder
Indemnified Persons may be entitled to receive pursuant to claims for
indemnification under Section 9.2(b) shall be the merger consideration
received by Securityholders under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Article 9, the maximum aggregate liability
of any individual Securityholder pursuant to this Article 9 shall in no event
exceed the portion of the merger consideration actually received by such
Securityholder pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(iii) _Recovery_. Effective after the Closing, in the event that any
Buyer Indemnified Person sustains or incurs Damages for which
Securityholders are obligated to indemnify such Buyer Indemnified Person
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ , the payments of Securityholders to such Buyer
Indemnified Person shall be made (and such Buyer Indemnified Person shall only
recover such payments as set forth under this Article 9) as follows:

  



  

(A) First, from the Indemnity Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement until such Damages are paid in full or until
the Indemnity Escrow Amount is extinguished;

  



  

(B) Then, under the RandW Insurance Policy to the extent of coverage
thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof; and

  



   

 | -45-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(C) Then, only for claims for indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i)
for breach or inaccuracy of any Company Fundamental Representation or for
claims for indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(ii) for willful or intentional
breach, Section 9.2(a)(iii) and Section 9.2(a)(vi), from Shareholders,
severally (on the basis of their respective Pro Rata Percentages), and not
jointly;

  



  

provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any claims for indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(iv) or Section
9.2(a)(v), or claims for indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i) for breaches
of the Tax Representations or the Contractor Representations, shall
be satisfied solely from the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount.

  



  

9.3 _Third-Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) _Definition_. As used herein, " _Third-Party Claim_ " means a
Claim made or instituted by a Person who is a third party against a Claimant,
as the case may be, for which such Claimant seeks indemnification pursuant to
this Article 9.

  



  

(b) _Notice of Claim_. If the Claimant seeks indemnification
hereunder in respect of a Third-Party Claim, the Claimant shall promptly
give written notice of the Third-Party Claim to the Party from whom the
Claimant is seeking indemnification under this Article 9 (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ "), stating the nature thereof and enclosing copies of any complaint,
summons, written assertion of such Third-Party Claim, or similar document. No
claim for indemnification on account of a Third-Party Claim shall be made
and no indemnification therefor shall be available under this Article 9 until
the Claimant shall have given initial written notice of its claim to the
Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(c) _Retention of Counsel by Indemnifying Party_. Subject to
Section 9.3(d), the Indemnifying Party may engage counsel to reasonably
acceptable to Claimant defend a Third-Party Claim by providing notice (a "
_Defense Notice_ ") to the Claimant not later than ten (10) Business Days
following delivery by the Claimant to the Indemnifying Party of a notice of a
Third-Party Claim if the Indemnifying Party provides the Claimant with
evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Claimant that the Indemnifying Party
shall have adequate financial resources to defend against the Third-Party
Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations with respect thereto.
The Indemnifying Party shall cause such counsel to consult with the Claimant,
as appropriate, as to the defense of such claim, and the Claimant may, at its
own expense, participate in such defense, assistance, or enforcement, but if
such election is made the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense,
assistance, or enforcement so long as it does so in compliance with the terms
of this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall cause such counsel so engaged
to keep the Claimant informed at all times throughout the course of the
litigation of the status of such defense, assistance, or enforcement.

  



  

(d) _Employment of Counsel by Claimant_.

  



  

(i) _Retention of Counsel by Claimant_. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 9.3(c), the Claimant shall have the right to
engage counsel at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party and to
control the defense of a Third-Party Claim if the Indemnifying Party shall
not have delivered the Defense Notice to Claimant pursuant to Section 9.3(c)
within the time period therein provided or if (A) the Third-Party Claim
involves remedies other than money damages (such as an injunction or other
equitable relief against the Claimant); (B) the Claimant has been advised in
writing by counsel that an actual conflict exists between the Claimant
and the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of the Third-Party
Claim; (C) the Third-Party Claim relates to or otherwise arises in connection
with any criminal or regulatory enforcement action; or (D) the Indemnifying
Party fails to conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim actively,
competently, and diligently.

  



  

   

 | -46-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) _Notice of Retention of Counsel by Claimant_. If the Claimant
chooses to exercise its right to appoint counsel under Section 9.3(d)(i), the
Claimant shall deliver notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party setting forth
in reasonable detail why it believes that it has such right and the name of
the counsel it proposes to employ. The Claimant may deliver such notice at any
time that any of the conditions to the exercise of such right appear to be
fulfilled, it being recognized that in the course of litigation, the scope of
litigation and the amount at stake may change. The Claimant shall thereupon
have the right to appoint such counsel at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party and assume control of the defense of a Third-Party Claim.
The Claimant shall, in such case, cause counsel to consult with the
Indemnifying Party as to the conduct of such defense.

  



  

(e) _Settlement of Third-Party Claims_.

  



  

(i) _Settlement by Indemnifying Party_. The Indemnifying Party may
settle any Third-Party Claim solely involving monetary damages only if
the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of such Third-Party Claim in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and the amount of such
settlement is to be paid entirely by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Article 9\. As to the settlement of any Third-Party Claim, the Claimant and
the Indemnifying Party shall consult as to terms of any proposed settlement.

  



  

(ii) _Claims the Indemnifying Party Cannot Settle_. The
Indemnifying Party shall not enter into a settlement of a Third-Party Claim
(A) if such settlement involves a non-monetary remedy or involves monetary
damages that shall not be paid entirely by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this Article 9, (B) if such settlement does not include a complete, full,
final, and unconditional release of the Claimant from all Liability on any
claims that relate to the subject matter of the Third-Party Claim, (C) if such
settlement involves any finding or admission of any violation of any Law by
the Claimant or its Affiliates, or (D) if such settlement has any effect on
any additional claims that may be made against the Claimant without, in any
case, the prior written consent of the Claimant, which consent may be
withheld in the Claimant's sole discretion.

  



  

9.4 _Cooperation_. Buyer and Securityholders shall cooperate with
one another in good faith and with due regard for the reasonable commercial
and financial interests of the other in connection with the defense,
compromise, or settlement of any claim or action, including Taxes, arising
out of, related to, or resulting from this Agreement, any other Transaction
Document, the Contemplated Transactions, the Business, the Company Assets, or
the Facilities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Party
controlling the defense or settlement of any such claim or action shall take
steps reasonably designed to ensure that the other Parties and their
counsel are informed at all times of the status of such matter.

  



  

9.5 _Tax Treatment_. Any indemnification payments pursuant to this
Article 9 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration by
the Parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Laws.

  



  

9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that,
from and after the Closing, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all Damages relating to this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
9, except (i) as otherwise provided in Section 1.8 or Article 8, (ii) for
actual fraud based on the representations and warranties set forth in Article
2 and Article 3 or (ii) for claims for breach of Post-Closing Covenants.
Except for (i) rights provided to a party under the indemnification provisions
set forth in this Article 9, (ii) right of a party under Section 1.8 and
Article 8, (iii) actual fraud based on the representations and warranties
set forth in Article 2 and Article 3 and (iv) for claims for breach of Post-
Closing Covenants, each Claimant hereby waives, from and after the Closing,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all Damages it
may have against any Indemnifying Party relating to the operation of the
Business or otherwise relating to this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions, whether arising under or based upon any applicable Law or
otherwise (including any right, whether arising at law or in equity, to
seek indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages, or any other
recourse or remedy, including as may arise under common law).

10. _TAX MATTERS._

  



  

10.1 _Taxes for the Straddle Period_. For purposes hereof, the
determination of the Taxes for (i) the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date and (ii) the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that
the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable periods, one that ended on the
day immediately before the Closing Date and the other that began at the
beginning of the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss, or
credit, and state and local apportionment factors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two
taxable periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries were closed at the close of
business on the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A)
exemptions, allowances, or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis,
such as depreciation, and (B) periodic Taxes, such as property or similar ad
valorem Taxes, shall be apportioned ratably between such periods on the basis
of the number of days elapsed in each such period.

  



  

10.2 _Tax Returns_. At the Securityholders' cost and expense, the
Shareholders' Representative shall timely prepare, or cause to be prepared,
all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company and the Subsidiaries with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (" _Company Prepared Tax Returns_ ").
Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and without a change of any
election or any accounting method and, with respect to any such Tax Return
due after the Closing Date, shall be submitted by the Shareholders'
Representative to Buyer (together with schedules, statements and, to the
extent requested by Buyer, supporting documentation) at least forty-five (45)
calendar days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Shareholders' Representative shall cause SCIOinspire Corp. to
timely elect, pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2015-13, a one-year Code Section
481(a) adjustment period for all positive Code Section 481(a) adjustments
required to be made in any taxable period that ends after the Closing Date,
and which relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and shall allocate such
adjustment to the taxable period ending, or portion deemed to end, on the
Closing Date. If Buyer objects to any item on any such Tax Return, it shall,
within twenty (20) calendar days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify
the Shareholders' Representative in writing that it so objects, specifying
with particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal
basis for any such objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly
delivered, the Shareholders' Representative and Buyer shall negotiate in good
faith and use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such items.
If the Shareholders' Representative and Buyer are unable to reach such
agreement within five (5) calendar days after receipt by the Shareholders'
Representative of such notice, the disputed items shall be resolved by the
Independent Accountant and any determination by the Independent Accountant
shall be final. The Independent Accountant shall resolve any disputed items
within twenty (20) calendar days of having the item referred to it pursuant
to such procedures as it may require. If the Independent Accountant is unable
to resolve any disputed items before the due date for such Tax Return, the Tax
Return shall be filed as prepared by the Shareholders' Representative and
then amended to reflect the Independent Accountant's resolution. The
costs, fees, and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne
equally by the Shareholders' Representative and Buyer. Subject to Article 9,
Securityholders shall pay all Taxes attributable to any Company Prepared Tax
Returns, except to the extent and in such amount as such Pre-Closing Taxes
were taken into account as liabilities in the calculation of Indebtedness.
Buyer shall timely prepare, or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns required
to be filed by the Company and the Subsidiaries with respect to any Post-
Closing Tax Period and Straddle Period (" _Buyer Prepared Tax Returns_ "). Any
such Buyer Prepared Tax Returns that reflect a Tax liability for which the
Securityholders would be required to indemnify pursuant to Article 9 shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required
by Law), and Buyer shall present such Tax Returns to the
Shareholders' Representative for review at least forty five (45) calendar
days before the due date on which such Tax Returns are required to be filed.
If the Shareholders' Representative objects to any item on any such Tax
Return, it shall, within twenty (20) calendar days after delivery of such Tax
Return, notify Buyer in writing that it so objects, specifying with
particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal basis
for any such objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly delivered,
the Shareholders' Representative and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith and
use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such items. If the
Shareholders' Representative and Buyer are unable to reach such agreement
within five (5) calendar days after receipt by the Shareholders'
Representative of such notice, the disputed items shall be resolved by the
Independent Accountant and any determination by the Independent Accountant
shall be final. The Independent Accountant shall resolve any disputed items
within twenty (20) calendar days of having the item referred to it pursuant to
such procedures as it may require. If the Independent Accountant is unable to
resolve any disputed items before the due date for such Tax Return, the Tax
Return shall be filed as prepared by Buyer and then amended to reflect the
Independent Accountant's resolution. The costs, fees, and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by the Shareholders'
Representative and Buyer. Subject to Article 9, Securityholders shall
promptly pay to Buyer all Pre-Closing Taxes reflected on all filed Buyer
Prepared Tax Returns, for which the Securityholders are responsible herein,
except to the extent and in such amount as such Pre-Closing Taxes were taken
into account as liabilities in the calculation of Indebtedness. Buyer shall
control all claims related to Buyer Prepared Tax Returns, except that in the
case of a Straddle Period return, the Securityholders retain the option to
participate in the defense of such Claims at their own costs and expense. In
no event, shall Buyer agree to settle any claim relating to or include a
Straddle Period for which the Securityholders may be liable without the prior
written consent of the Shareholders' Representative, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

10.3 _Cooperation_. The Shareholders' Representative and Buyer shall
provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of
them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return or in
connection with any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes of the
Company or the Subsidiaries. Such cooperation and information shall include
providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with
accompanying schedules, related work papers, and documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by tax authorities. Each of the Company and Buyer
shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records, and other
documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Company and the
Subsidiaries until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the
taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate.

10.4 _Tax Covenants_. Without the prior written consent of Buyer,
which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, Securityholders (and, prior
to the Closing, the Company, the Subsidiaries, and their respective
Representatives) shall not, to the extent it may affect, or relate to, the
Company or any Subsidiary, make, change, or rescind any Tax election, amend
any Tax Return or take any position on any Tax Return, take any action, omit
to take any action, or enter into any other transaction that would have the
effect of increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax asset of Buyer,
the Company, or any Subsidiary in respect of any Post-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

10.5 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added, and other such Taxes (including any penalties and
interest) (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (including any real
property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be borne and paid fifty
percent (50%) by Securityholders (and such shall constitute a Company Expense
hereunder) and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer when due. If Buyer is responsible
for the Tax under applicable Law, Securityholders shall promptly upon demand
pay their portion of such Taxes payable by Buyer. Securityholders shall
timely file any Tax Return or other document with respect to such Taxes or
fees, and Buyer will timely join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or
other documentation. Buyer and the Securityholders shall cooperate to minimize
or avoid any such Transfer Taxes that might be imposed to the extent
permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

10.6 _Transaction Tax Deductions_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, any Transaction Tax Deductions shall be
treated as arising in a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date for purposes of calculating the obligation
of the Securityholders with respect to Taxes hereunder; provided, however,
that such Transaction Tax Deductions shall only be treated as deductible in
such periods to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

10.7 _Section 338 Elections_. Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of
Buyer shall make any election pursuant to Section 338 of the Code and
the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder or any comparable
election under state or local or foreign Tax Law) with respect to SCIOinspire
Corp.

  



  

10.8 _VDA Procedures_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, following the Closing, each of Buyer, the Surviving Company, each of
the Surviving Company's Subsidiaries, and each of their respective Affiliates
and agents shall have the right to contact any state and local taxing
authorities (" _Taxing Authorities_ ") with respect to sales and use Taxes
related to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and, subject to the consent of
Shareholders' Representative (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter into a "voluntary disclosure
agreement" or other similar program with any such Taxing Authority with
respect to such sales and use Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Period
(each, a " _VDA Proceeding_ "). Buyer shall have the right to control in any
process or proceeding (including the amendment, preparation and filing of
sales and use Tax Returns) relating to any VDA Proceeding; provided, however,
(i) the Shareholders' Representative shall have the right (but not the duty)
to (A) participate in any VDA Proceeding, (B) attend any meetings or
conferences with any Taxing Authority relating to a VDA Proceeding, (C)
consult with Buyer concerning the conduct of a VDA Proceeding, and (D) employ
counsel, solely at its own expense, (ii) at least fifteen (15) Business Days
prior to the submission of any letters, documents, or calculations to a
Taxing Authority in connection with a VDA Proceeding, Buyer shall provide the
Shareholders' Representative with a reasonable opportunity to comment on any
such materials prepared or furnished in connection with a VDA Proceeding
prior to their submission and shall consider in good faith any comments made
by the Shareholders' Representative with respect thereto, and (iii) Buyer
shall keep the Shareholders' Representative reasonably informed of the status
of any VDA Proceeding throughout the process of such VDA Proceeding.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the amendment, preparation
and filing of any Tax Returns required to be filed pursuant to a VDA
Proceeding, shall be governed by this Section 10.8. For the avoidance of
doubt, any sales and use Tax amounts due to a Taxing Authority pursuant to a
VDA Proceeding attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be considered a
Pre-Closing Tax subject to indemnification by the Securityholders pursuant to
Section 9.2(a)(iv) (subject to the limitations set forth in Article 9).

appropriate remedy), provided the disclosing Party shall disclose only that
portion of such information which such disclosing Party is advised by their

applicable Securityholder, any of its Affiliates, or any of its or their
Representatives. If, however, any Securityholder, any of its Affiliates, or

11.2 _Modification of Covenant; Enforcement of Covenant_.

  



  

(a) The Company, Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge that the
restrictions contained in Section 11.1 are reasonable and necessary
to protect the legitimate interests of the Company, Buyer and Merger Sub
constitute a material inducement to the Company, Merger Sub and Buyer to
enter into this Agreement and consummate the Contemplated Transactions. If a
final judgment of a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction determines
that any term or provision contained in Section 11.1 is invalid or
unenforceable, then the Parties agree that the court or tribunal shall have
the power (a) to reduce the scope, duration, or geographic area of the term
or provision to the maximum scope, duration, or geographic area permitted by
Law and (b) to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision. Section 11.1 shall be enforceable as so
modified. The covenants contained in Section 11.1 and each provision thereof
are severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions
hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other
jurisdiction.

  



  

(b) Buyer and the Company agree that a breach or threatened breach
of Section 11.1 would give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer, Merger Sub and
the Company, as applicable, for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event of a breach or a
threatened breach by Buyer or the Company of any such obligations, Buyer, and
the Company, shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that
may be available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable
relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific
performance and any other relief that may be available from a court of
competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond).

Representatives. Upon any termination of this Agreement, the obligation
of each Party to pay its own expenses shall be subject to any rights of such

12.7 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES
AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, OR THE
CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO

12.9 _Waiver_. The rights and remedies of the Parties to this
Agreement are cumulative and not alternative and are not in lieu of any other
remedies available at Law, in equity, or otherwise. Neither the failure nor
any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under

a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial
exercise of any such right, power, or privilege shall preclude any other or
further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any
other right, power, or privilege. No waiver that may be given by a Party shall

12.10 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits and Schedules, which are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof) supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements between the
Parties with respect to its subject matter (including the Non-Binding Letter
of Intent dated March 1, 2018, which shall be of no further force and effect
from and after the execution hereof) and constitutes a complete and exclusive
statement of the terms of the agreement between the Parties with respect to
its subject matter; provided, however, that this Agreement shall be without
prejudice to the independent effectiveness and enforceability of each other
Transaction Document. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written
agreement executed by and among the Parties.

  



  

12.11 _Beneficiaries; Assignment; No Third-Party Rights_. This
Agreement shall apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the

under this Agreement to (a) any Affiliate, (b) any party succeeding to its

otherwise, and (c) any debt financing source or other Person providing

under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement,
except for (i) any Securityholder Indemnified Person or Buyer Indemnified
Person, each of whom shall have the rights set forth in Article 9, and (ii)

12.12 _Severability_. If, after giving effect to Section 11.2, any term
or provision of this Agreement is still held to be invalid or
unenforceable by a Governmental Authority, such term or provision shall be
deemed to be severed from this Agreement, and the other provisions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held to be invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall
remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or
unenforceable.

  



  

12.13 _Schedules_. Each Schedule is qualified in its entirety by
reference to specific provisions of the Agreement and does not constitute, and
shall not be construed as constituting, representations, warranties or
covenants of the Company, Merger Sub or Buyer, except as and to the extent
provided in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the fact that the Schedules are
arranged by sections corresponding to the sections in this Agreement or that
a particular section of this Agreement makes reference to a specific section
of the Schedules or that a particular representation and warranty may not
make a reference to the Schedules, any item of disclosure in the
Schedules shall be deemed disclosed for a particular representation, warranty
or schedule to the extent its relevance to such representation, warranty or
schedule is readily apparent on its face. The inclusion of information in the
Schedules shall not be construed as an admission that such information is
material to any Company or any of the Subsidiaries. In addition, matters
reflected in the Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by
this Agreement to be reflected in the Schedules. Such additional matters
are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include
other matters of a similar nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar
amount in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement
nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules is intended to imply
that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other
items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the
setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described herein or included in the Schedule is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement. Further, neither the specification of
any item or matter in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules is
intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or
are not in the ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact
of setting forth or the inclusion of any such items or matter in any dispute
or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described herein or included in the Schedules is or is not in
the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement.

Attorney Client Privilege_.

  



  

(a) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including the
Company and the Subsidiaries after the Closing) (Buyer and all such
other Persons, the " _Buyer Group_ ") hereby waives any claim that Metz Lewis
Brodman Must O'Keefe LLC and any other legal counsel currently representing
the Company or any Subsidiary (each, a " _Prior Company Counsel_ ") in
connection with this Agreement, the negotiation thereof or its subject matter
or the Contemplated Transactions (" _Pre-Closing Representation_ ") has or
will have a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from representing
the Shareholders or any of their officers, directors, members, managers or
Affiliates (" _Designated Persons_ ") in any dispute with any member of the
Buyer Group or any other matter relating to this Agreement, the negotiation
thereof or its subject matter or the Contemplated Transactions, in each case,
after the Closing Date (" _Post-Closing Representation_ "), even though the
interests of one or more of the Designated Persons in such dispute or other
matter may be directly adverse to the interests of one or more members of
the Buyer Group and even though Prior Company Counsel may have represented
the Company or one or more of the Subsidiaries in a matter substantially
related to such dispute or other matter and may be handling ongoing matters
for one or more members of the Buyer Group.

(b) Buyer, on behalf of the Buyer Group, hereby covenants and
agrees, that, as to all communications between any Prior Company Counsel,
on the one hand, and any Designated Person, the Company or any Subsidiary
(with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary, solely prior to the Closing),
on the other hand, that relate in any way to the Pre-Closing Representation,
the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belong
to and shall be controlled by the Shareholders or the applicable Designated
Person, and shall not pass to or be claimed by any member of the Buyer Group.
Nonetheless, no member of the Buyer Group may use or rely on any
communication described in the immediately preceding sentence in any Claim
against or involving any of the Designated Persons. Buyer, on behalf of the
Buyer Group, hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, any attorney-
client privilege or confidentiality obligation with respect to any
communication between any Prior Company Counsel, on the one hand, and any

At the Effective Time, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, all of the
Shares shall be canceled and no longer be outstanding and the Register of
Securityholders of the Company shall be updated accordingly, and each holder
of Shares (other than the Excluded Shares) shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive that portion of the
Cash Merger Consideration to which the holder of Shares is entitled under the
Merger Agreement. By executing and delivering this Letter of Transmittal, the
Undersigned also hereby represents, warrants, covenants and agrees as
follows:

  



  

1. The Undersigned is the sole legal and beneficial owner of the Shares held by the Undersigned, as set forth herein (the " _Undersigned 's Shares_"), with good title to the Undersigned's Shares, and has the full power and authority to sell, assign and transfer the Undersigned's Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances and, except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, without conflict, violation or breach of any Contract or Law to which the Undersigned or the Undersigned's Shares are subject or by which the Undersigned or the Undersigned's Shares are bound.

  



  

2. The Undersigned, upon request of the Paying Agent will execute and deliver any additional documents reasonably necessary or desirable to complete the payment of the portion of the Cash Merger Consideration payable to the Undersigned. In such case, the Undersigned acknowledges that the delivery will be effected, and the risk of loss and title to any such items will pass, only upon receipt thereof by the Paying Agent. All authority conferred or agreed to be conferred in this Letter of Transmittal shall be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives of the Undersigned and shall not be affected by, and shall survive, the death or incapacity of the Undersigned.

  



  

3. THE UNDERSIGNED (A) HEREBY CONSENTS, APPROVES, AGREES AND RATIFIES IN ALL RESPECTS THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND (B) HEREBY WAIVES ALL DISSENTERS', APPRAISAL OR SIMILAR RIGHTS, IF ANY, THAT THE UNDERSIGNED MAY HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATED TO THE MERGER AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT AS A RESULT OF THE UNDERSIGNED'S OWNERSHIP OF THE SHARES.

  



  

4. In exchange for the Cash Merger Consideration provided in the Merger Agreement, the Undersigned and the heirs, executors, representatives, agents, insurers, administrators, successors and assigns of the Undersigned (collectively, the " _Releasors_ ") irrevocably and unconditionally fully and forever waive, release and discharge the Company and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors and assigns, and all of their respective officers, directors, employees and shareholders, in their corporate and individual capacities (collectively, the " _Releasees_ "), from any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of actions, obligations, judgments, rights, fees, damages, debts, obligations, liabilities and expenses (inclusive of attorneys' fees) of any kind whatsoever (collectively, " _Claims_ "), whether known or unknown, from the beginning of time through the Closing, that Releasors may have against the Releasees, except for Claims (i) made under the Merger Agreement or any other Transaction Document (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (ii) for unpaid employment compensation from the Company, or (iii) made under the policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company.

5. The Undersigned understands that (a) unless and until the Undersigned submits a duly completed Letter of Transmittal in accordance with the instructions herein, no cash payments of Cash Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement shall be made to the Undersigned or its designee, (b) payment is conditioned on the Closing of the Merger and (c) no Share will accrue on any cash payment due.

  



  

6. Any term or provision of this Letter of Transmittal that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, all other conditions and provisions of this Letter of Transmittal shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Letter of Transmittal so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

6. This Letter of Transmittal shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction), except as otherwise set forth in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

7. THE UNDERSIGNED ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, THE MERGER AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, THE UNDERSIGNED IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THE UNDERSIGNED MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, OR THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. THE UNDERSIGNED CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY PARTY TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A CLAIM, (ii) THE UNDERSIGNED HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, AND (iii) THE UNDERSIGNED MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY.

To Designate an Alternate Address

---|---|--- 
  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 

![](tv497868_excimg01.jpg)

    



  

Signing the Transmittal in a Representative Capacity

   | *| If you are signing the Letter of Transmittal in a representative
capacity such as trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-
fact, officer of a corporation, or other capacity, indicate such capacity in
the "Capacity" line in Box E. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Please note that under certain circumstances you may be requested to provide
additional supporting documentation such as a certified copy of a trust
agreement, corporate board resolutions, incumbency certificate, or articles of
association, as applicable. If any surrendered certificates or agreements are
registered in different names, it will be necessary to complete, sign, and
submit as many Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations.

  



  

2\. Stock Power

  



   | *| If  you wish to transfer ownership of any Shares identified in Box
A, you must provide a  valid stock power evidencing such transfer. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

NOTE

   | *| Each  stock power must have a Medallion Signature Guarantee and
the Letter of Transmittal must  be signed by the new registered holder
according to the stock power. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

3\. IRS Tax Forms

  



   | *| Under  United States federal income tax laws, a holder who
receives cash payments pursuant to  the Merger is required to provide the
Paying Agent (as payer) with such holder's  correct TIN on the Form W-9 (or
otherwise establish a basis for exemption from backup  withholding) and
certify under penalty of perjury that such TIN is correct and that such 
holder is not subject to backup withholding. If such holder is an individual,
the TIN  is his or her social security number. If the Paying Agent is not
provided with the correct  TIN, a $50 penalty may be imposed by the Internal
Revenue Service and the payment of  any cash pursuant to the Merger may be
subject to backup withholding. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Certain holders (including, among others, all corporations and foreign
individuals and entities) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements. Exempt holders should indicate their exempt status on
Form W-9. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as

  

an exempt recipient, such individual must submit a Form W-8 BEN, signed under
penalties of perjury, attesting to such individual's exempt status. A Form
W-8 BEN can be obtained via the link below. Please note that there are
additional Form W-8\'s if the W-8BEN does not apply to your particular
situation.

  



  

If backup withholding applies, the Paying Agent is required to withhold at a
rate not to exceed 28% of any payments made to the holder or other payee.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the Federal income tax
liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the
amount of tax withheld provided that the required information is given to the
IRS. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be
obtained from the Internal Revenue Service.

Resident tax status? If so:

![](tv497868_excimg01.jpg)

    



  

Signatures required to be guaranteed on the Letter of Transmittal or on a

insured, with return receipt requested or via overnight  delivery service. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Completion of the Letter of Transmittal

   | *| If  the Paying Agent determines that any Letter of Transmittal or
IRS tax form has not been  properly completed or executed, or that a
certificate or agreement is not in proper form  for surrender, or if any
other irregularity in connection with the surrender exists,  the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to consult with the Buyer or Shareholders' Representative 
for further instructions and may reject the Letter of Transmittal, IRS tax
form, certificate(s),  and other document. If there are any discrepancies
between any Letter of Transmittal,  IRS tax form, certificate or other
document, the Paying Agent shall consult with the  Buyer or Shareholders'
Representative for instructions as to the shares of Stock  of the Company, if
any, it is authorized to accept for payment, and shall, except as  thereafter
directed in writing by the Buyer or Shareholders' Representative, continue 
to hold any certificates and other documents surrendered in connection
therewith. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Stock Transfer Taxes

   | *| The  registered holder shall timely pay all transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration  and other taxes arising from or relating to
the transactions contemplated by the Merger  Agreement (" _Merger Agreement
Taxes_ ") to the extent they relate specifically  to the payment of cash to
the undersigned, and the undersigned shall, at his or her own  expense, file
all necessary tax returns and other documentation with respect to the Merger 
Agreement Taxes. In the event that any Merger Agreement Taxes become payable
by reason  of the payment of the Merger Consideration in any name other than
that of the registered  holder, such transferee or assignee must pay such
Merger Agreement Tax or establish that  such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. The Paying Agent will have no responsibility  with respect to
Merger Agreement Taxes.

(ii) _Escrow Notice_. In respect of any Third Party Claim or Direct
Claim, Buyer shall promptly deliver an Escrow Notice to the Escrow Agent and
Shareholders' Representative no later than 5:00 P.M. New York time on the

Notice from time to time upon a good faith determination by Buyer that the
Claimed Amount with respect to the Escrow Notice should be increased or
decreased by delivering the updated Escrow Notice in accordance with the
notice provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
failure to deliver the Escrow Notice or an updated Escrow Notice to the Escrow
Agent or Shareholders' Representative in accordance with the requirements of
this Section 4(d)(ii) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from
satisfying its indemnity obligations by disbursement from the Escrow Account
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement.

  



  

(iii) _Response Notice; Failure to Deliver a Response Notice_. Within
the Response Period, the Shareholders' Representative shall deliver a
Response Notice to Buyer and the Escrow Agent, such delivery to be in
accordance with the notice provisions of this Agreement. For the purposes of
determining the Response Period, the Escrow Agent shall conclusively presume
that any Escrow Notice delivered to it was simultaneously delivered the
Shareholder Representative as provided above, and the Escrow Agent need not
verify the other Party's receipt. The Response Notice shall indicate the
Agreed Amount and the Contested Amount with respect to the Escrow Notice. If
the Shareholders' Representative fails to deliver a Response Notice within the
Response Period, the Shareholders' Representative will be deemed to have
accepted the claim that is the subject of the Escrow Notice, the entire
Claimed Amount shall be deemed to be an Agreed Amount and the Escrow Agent
shall follow the process set forth in Section 4(d)(iv) below to disburse the
full Claimed Amount to Buyer or its designee.

  



  

(iv) _Full Claimed Amount_. If the Shareholders' Representative
delivers a Response Notice to Buyer, and the Escrow Agent, agreeing that the
full Claimed Amount is owed to Buyer or fails to deliver a Response Notice
within the Response Period, then, within three (3) Business Days following
the receipt of such Response Notice by Buyer and Escrow Agent or following the
end of the Response Period, Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent with a copy
to the Shareholder Representative asking the Escrow Agent to release the full
Claimed Amount (or such lesser amount as may remain of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount or the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount, as applicable) to Buyer or its
designee in accordance with the wire instructions set forth in the
instructions from Buyer.

  



  

(v) _Partial Claimed Amount_. If Shareholders' Representative delivers
a Response Notice to Buyer and the Escrow Agent agreeing that less than the
full Claimed Amount is owed to Buyer, then, within three (3) Business Days
following the receipt of such Response Notice by Buyer, the Representatives
shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Instruction instructing
the Escrow Agent to release the Agreed Amount (or such lesser amount as may
remain of the Indemnity Escrow Amount or the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount,
as applicable) to Buyer or its designee in accordance with the wire
instructions set forth in the Joint Instruction from the Indemnity Escrow
Amount or the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount, as applicable.

(vi) _Contested Amount_. If Shareholders' Representative delivers a
Response Notice to Buyer and the Escrow Agent indicating that there is a
Contested Amount, then the Escrow Agent shall not pay out any portion of the
Escrow Funds with respect to the Contested Amount unless and until otherwise
instructed in a Joint Instruction or pursuant to Section 4(b) above. If the
Representatives resolve such dispute in writing, then a settlement agreement
stipulating the amount owed to Buyer (the " _Stipulated Amount_ ") shall be
signed by the Representatives. Within three (3) Business Days after the
execution of such settlement agreement, the Representatives shall execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Instruction pursuant to Section 4(b) to
release the Stipulated Amount (or such lesser amount as may remain of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount or the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount, as applicable)
to Buyer according to the wire instructions set forth in the Joint
Instruction from the Indemnity Escrow Amount or the Special Indemnity Escrow
Amount, as applicable.

  



  

(vii) _Conflict with Merger Agreement_. In the event that any of the
foregoing provisions conflict with the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement, the terms set forth herein will govern the release of the
Escrow Amount with respect to the Escrow Agent and the terms of the Merger
Agreement will govern such release as between Buyer and the Shareholders'
Representative.

  



  

(e) _Expiration of Escrow; Release of Funds_.

  



  

(i) _Indemnity Escrow Release Date_. On the Indemnity Escrow Release
Date, the Representatives shall deliver a Joint Instruction to the
Escrow Agent to pay in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds
from the Escrow Account to the Paying Agent or the Company for the benefit of
Securityholders the amount equal to: (a) the Indemnity Escrow Amount; _minus_
(b) any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount that constitutes Contested
Amounts; _minus_ (c) amounts paid out of the Indemnity Escrow Amount prior to
such date to satisfy any Claims. Any Contested Amount shall remain in the
Escrow Account until the underlying Claim(s) in respect thereof are finally
resolved at which time, such Contested Amounts shall be released pursuant to
Section 4(b) hereof. The Joint Instruction shall set forth the amounts
payable to and wire instructions for the Paying Agent and the Company, and the
Escrow Agent will promptly thereafter distribute such Escrow Funds as
directed in the Joint Instruction.

  



  

(ii) _Special Indemnity Escrow Release Date_. On the Special Indemnity
Escrow Release Date, the Representatives shall deliver a Joint Instruction to
the Escrow Agent to pay in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds from the Escrow Account to the Paying Agent or the Company for the
benefit of Securityholders the amount equal to: (a) the Special Indemnity
Escrow Amount; _minus_ (b) any portion of the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount
that constitutes Contested Amounts; _minus_ (c) amounts paid out of
the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount prior to such date to satisfy any Claims.
Any Contested Amount shall remain in the Escrow Account until the underlying
Claim(s) in respect thereof are finally resolved at which time, such Contested
Amounts shall be released pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof. The Joint
Instruction shall set forth the amounts payable to and wire instructions for
the Paying Agent and the Company, and the Escrow Agent will promptly
thereafter distribute such Escrow Funds as directed in the Joint Instruction.

  



  

(iii) _No Parallel Satisfaction_. Except as provided in Section 4(a),
the Escrow Agent shall not under any circumstances be permitted or authorized
to, and shall in no event utilize, any Escrow Funds reserved in one escrow
property to satisfy any amounts that may be payable hereunder from a separate
escrow property and each escrow property shall at all times remain separate
and exclusive of all other escrow funds.

Portable Document Format (" _PDF_ ") attached to an email only at the fax
number or email address set forth in Section 9 below. Each Designation of
Authorized Representatives shall be signed by a Secretary, any Assistant

of a facsimile, as evidenced by a confirmed transmittal to the Party's or
Parties' transmitting fax number and the Escrow Agent has been able to satisfy
any applicable security procedures as may be required hereunder. The Escrow
Agent shall not be liable to any Party or other person for refraining from
acting upon any instruction for or related to the transfer or distribution of
the Escrow Funds if delivered to any other fax number or email address,
including but not limited to a valid email address of any employee of the
Escrow Agent.

  



  

(g) _Wire Instructions_. Each Party authorizes the Escrow Agent to use
the funds transfer instructions (" _Initial Standing Instructions_

(h) _Wire Instruction Changes_. In the event any funds transfer
instructions other than the Initial Standing Instructions are set forth in a
permitted instruction from a Party or the Parties in accordance with this
Agreement (any such additional funds transfer instructions, " _Additional
Standing Instructions_ " and, together with the Initial Standing Instructions,
the " _Standing Instructions_ "), the Escrow Agent will confirm such
Additional Standing Instructions by a telephone call-back or
email confirmation to an Authorized Representative of such Party or Parties,
and the Escrow Agent may rely and act upon the confirmation of anyone
purporting to be that Authorized Representative. No funds will be disbursed
until such confirmation occurs. Each Party agrees that after such
confirmation, the Escrow Agent may continue to rely solely upon such
Additional Standing Instructions and all identifying information set forth
therein for such beneficiary without an additional telephone call-back or
email confirmation. Further, it is understood and agreed that if multiple
disbursements are provided for under this Agreement pursuant to any
Standing Instructions, only the date, amount and/or description of payments
may change without requiring a telephone call-back or email confirmation.

  



  

(i) _Authorized Person Changes_. The persons designated as Authorized
Representatives and telephone numbers for same may be changed only in a
writing executed by an Authorized Representative or other duly authorized
officer of the applicable Party setting forth such changes and actually
received by the Escrow Agent via facsimile or as a PDF attached to an email.
The Escrow Agent will confirm any such change in Authorized Representatives
by a telephone call-back or email confirmation to an Authorized Representative
and the Escrow Agent may rely and act upon the confirmation of anyone
purporting to be that Authorized Representative.

  



  

(j) _Account Numbers_. The Escrow Agent, any intermediary bank and the
beneficiary's bank in any funds transfer may rely upon the identifying number
of the beneficiary's bank or any intermediary bank included in a funds
transfer instruction provided by a Party or the Parties and confirmed by an
Authorized Representative. Further, the beneficiary's bank in the funds
transfer instructions may make payment on the basis of the account number
provided in such Party's or the Parties' instruction and confirmed by an
Authorized Representative even though it identifies a person different from
the named beneficiary.

  



  

(k) _Security Procedures_. The Parties acknowledge that the security
procedures set forth in this Section 4 are commercially reasonable.

confirmed by a verifying call-back (or email confirmation) to an Authorized
Representative.

(l) _Term_. Upon delivery of the Escrow Funds in full by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to this Section 4, this Agreement shall terminate, and all the
related account(s) shall be closed, subject to the provisions of Section 7 and
8.

  



  

5. _Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent shall have only those duties as are specifically and expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature, and no other duties, including but not limited to any fiduciary duty, shall be implied. The Escrow Agent has no obligation to comply with the terms and conditions of any other agreement between the Parties, nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to determine if any Party has complied with any other agreement. Notwithstanding the terms of any other agreement between the Parties, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control the actions of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent may conclusively rely upon any written notice, document, instruction or request delivered by the Parties believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed by an Authorized Representative(s), as applicable, without inquiry and without requiring substantiating evidence of any kind and the Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document, notice, instruction or request. Any notice, document, instruction or request delivered by a Party but not required under this Agreement may be disregarded by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith except to the extent that the Escrow Agent's fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct was the cause of any direct loss to either Party. The Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through affiliates or agents. In the event the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain, or believes there is some ambiguity, as to its duties or rights hereunder or receives instructions, claims or demands from any Party hereto which, in the Escrow Agent's judgment, conflict with the provisions of this Agreement, or if the Escrow Agent receives conflicting instructions from the Parties, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled either to: (a) refrain from taking any action until it shall be given (i) a Joint Instruction executed by the Representatives which eliminates such conflict or (ii) a court order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction (it being understood that the Escrow Agent shall be entitled conclusively to rely and act upon any such court order and shall have no obligation to determine whether any such court order is final); or (b) file an action in interpleader. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments which may be due it or the Escrow Fund, including, without limitation, the Escrow Amount nor shall the Escrow Agent have any duty or obligation to confirm or verify the accuracy or correctness of any amounts deposited with it hereunder. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, incidental, punitive, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

6. _Succession_. The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving no less than thirty (30) days advance notice in writing of such resignation to the Parties or may be removed, with or without cause, by the Parties at any time after giving not less than thirty (30) days advance joint written notice to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent's sole responsibility after such thirty (30) day notice period expires shall be to hold the Escrow Funds and to deliver the same to a designated substitute escrow agent, if any, appointed by the Parties, or such other person designated by the Parties, or in accordance with the directions of a final court order, at which time of delivery, the Escrow Agent's obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate. If prior to the effective resignation or removal date, the Parties have failed to appoint a successor escrow agent, or to instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver the Escrow Funds to another person as provided above, or if such delivery is contrary to applicable law, at any time on or after the effective resignation date, the Escrow Agent either (a) may interplead the Escrow Funds with a court located in the State of New York and the costs, expenses and reasonable attorney's fees which are incurred in connection with such proceeding may be charged against and withdrawn from the Escrow Funds; or (b) appoint a successor escrow agent of its own choice. Any appointment of a successor escrow agent shall be binding upon the Parties and no appointed successor escrow agent shall be deemed to be an agent of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall deliver the Escrow Funds to any appointed successor escrow agent, at which time the Escrow Agent's obligations under this Agreement shall cease and terminate. Any entity into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or substantially all the escrow business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act.

  



  

7. _Compensation; Acknowledgment_.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree jointly and severally to pay the Escrow Agent
upon execution of this Agreement and from time to time thereafter
reasonable compensation for the services to be rendered hereunder, which
unless otherwise agreed in writing, shall be as described in _Schedule 2_.

  



  

(b) Each of the Parties further agrees to the disclosures and
agreements set forth in _Schedule 2_.

  



  

8. _Indemnification and Reimbursement_. The Parties agree jointly and severally to indemnify, defend, hold harmless, pay or reimburse the Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective successors, assigns, directors, agents and employees (the " _Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorney's fees) (collectively " _Losses_ "), resulting directly or indirectly from (a) the Escrow Agent's performance of this Agreement, except to the extent that such Losses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by the fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or bad faith of such Indemnitee; and (b) the Escrow Agent's following, accepting or acting upon any instructions or directions, whether joint or singular, from the Parties received in accordance with this Agreement. The Parties hereby grant the Escrow Agent a right of set-off against the Escrow Funds for the payment of any claim for indemnification, fees, expenses and amounts due to the Escrow Agent or an Indemnitee. The obligations set forth in this Section 8 shall survive the resignation, replacement or removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement.

  



  

9. _Notices_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4, all communications hereunder shall be in writing or set forth in a PDF attached to an email, and shall be delivered by facsimile, email or overnight courier only to the appropriate fax number, email address, or notice address set forth for each party as follows:

10. _Compliance with Court Orders_. In the event that a legal garnishment, attachment, levy, restraining notice or court order is served with respect to any of the Fund, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, the Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all such orders so entered or issued, and in the event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order it shall not be liable to any of the Parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance notwithstanding such order be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

  



  

11. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a) The provisions of this Agreement may be waived, altered, amended or
supplemented only by a writing signed by the Escrow Agent and the Parties.
Neither this Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder may be assigned by
any Party without the prior consent of the Escrow Agent and the other Party.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State
of New York. Each Party and the Escrow Agent irrevocably waives any objection
on the grounds of venue, forum non-conveniens or any similar grounds and
irrevocably consents to service of process by mail or in any other manner
permitted by applicable law and consents to the jurisdiction of the courts
located in the State of New York. To the extent that in any jurisdiction
either Party may now or hereafter be entitled to claim for itself or its
assets, immunity from suit, execution, attachment (before or after judgment)
or other legal process, such Party shall not claim, and hereby irrevocably
waives, such immunity. The Escrow Agent and the Parties further hereby
waive any right to a trial by jury with respect to any lawsuit or judicial
proceeding arising or relating to this Agreement.

  



  

(b) No party to this Agreement is liable to any other party for losses
due to, or if it is unable to perform its obligations under the terms of this
Agreement because of, acts of God, fire, war, terrorism, floods, strikes,
electrical outages, equipment or transmission failure, or other causes
reasonably beyond its control. This Agreement and any joint instructions from
the Parties may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and
the same instrument or instruction, as applicable. This Agreement may be
executed and transmitted by facsimile or as a PDF attached to an email and
each such execution shall be of the same legal effect, validity and
enforceability as a manually executed original, wet-inked signature. All
signatures of the parties to this Agreement may be transmitted by facsimile or
as a PDF attached to an email, and such facsimile or PDF will, for all
purposes, be deemed to be the original signature of such party whose signature
it reproduces, and will be binding upon such party. If any provision of this
Agreement is determined to be prohibited or unenforceable by reason of any
applicable law of a jurisdiction, then such provision shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and
any such prohibition or unenforceability in such jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provisions in any other jurisdiction.
The Parties each represent, warrant and covenant that (i) each document,
notice, instruction or request provided by such Party to the Escrow Agent
shall comply with applicable laws and regulations; (ii) such Party has full
power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform all of the

authorized to do so, and each Authorized Representative of such Party has
been duly and properly authorized to take actions specified for such person
in the applicable _Schedule 1_. Except as expressly provided in Section 8
above, nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be
construed to (a) give to any person or entity other than the Parties any legal
or equitable right, remedy, interest or claim under or in respect of the
Escrow Funds or (b) give to any person or entity other than the Escrow Agent
and the Parties any legal or equitable right, remedy, interest or claim under
or this Agreement.

Representations Relating to Section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (Rule 15Ba1-1 et seq.) (the "Municipal Advisor Rule"). Each Party
represents and warrants to Escrow Agent that for purposes of the Municipal
Advisor Rules, none of the funds (if any) currently invested, or that will be
invested in the future, in money market funds, commercial paper or treasury
bills under this Agreement constitute or contain (i) proceeds of municipal
securities (including investment income therefrom and monies pledged or
otherwise legally dedicated to serve as collateral or a source or repayment
for such securities) or (ii) municipal escrow investments (as each such term
is defined in the Municipal Advisor Rule). Each Party also represents and
warrants to Escrow Agent that the person providing this certification has
access to the appropriate information or has direct knowledge of the source of
the funds to be invested to enable the forgoing representation to be made.
Further, each Party acknowledges that Escrow Agent will rely on this
representation until notified in writing otherwise.

  



  

Patriot Act Disclosure. Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening America
by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001 ("USA PATRIOT Act") requires Escrow Agent to implement
reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person that opens a new
account with it. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge that Section 326 of the
USA PATRIOT Act and Escrow Agent's identity verification procedures require
Escrow Agent to obtain information which may be used to confirm the
Parties' identity including without limitation name, address and
organizational documents ("identifying information"). The Parties agree to
provide Escrow Agent with and consent to Escrow Agent obtaining from third
parties any such identifying information required as a condition of opening
an account with or using any service provided by Escrow Agent.

  



  

OFAC Disclosure. Escrow Agent is required to act in accordance with the laws
and regulations of various jurisdictions relating to the prevention of
money laundering and the implementation of sanctions, including but not
limited to regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control.
Escrow Agent is not obligated to execute payment orders or effect any other
transaction where the beneficiary or other payee is a person or entity with
whom Escrow Agent is prohibited from doing business by any law or regulation
applicable to Escrow Agent, or in any case where compliance would, in Escrow
Agent's opinion, conflict with applicable law or banking practice or its own
policies and procedures. Where Escrow Agent does not execute a payment order
or effect a transaction for such reasons, Escrow Agent may take any action
required by any law or regulation applicable to Escrow Agent including,
without limitation, freezing or blocking funds. Transaction screening may
result in delays in the posting of transactions.

  



  

Abandoned Property. Escrow Agent is required to act in accordance with the
laws and regulations of various states relating to abandoned property,
escheatment or similar law and, accordingly, shall be entitled to remit
dormant funds to any state as abandoned property in accordance with such laws
and regulations. Without limitation of the foregoing, notwithstanding any
instruction to the contrary, Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party
for any amount disbursed from an account maintained under this Agreement to a
governmental entity or public official in compliance with any applicable
abandoned property, escheatment or similar law.

Information. The Parties authorize Escrow Agent to disclose information with
respect to this Agreement and the account(s) established hereunder, the
Parties, or any transaction hereunder if such disclosure is: (i) necessary in
Escrow Agent's opinion, for the purpose of allowing Escrow Agent to perform
its duties and to exercise its powers and rights hereunder or for compliance
with legal, tax and regulatory requirements, including, without limitation,
FATCA; (ii) to a proposed assignee of the rights of Escrow Agent; (iii) to a
branch, affiliate, subsidiary, employee or agent of Escrow Agent or to their
auditors, regulators or legal advisers or to any competent court; (iv) to the
auditors of any of the Parties; or (v) required by applicable law, regardless
of whether the disclosure is made in the country in which each Party resides,
in which the Escrow Account is maintained, or in which the transaction is
conducted. The Parties agree that such disclosures by Escrow Agent and its
affiliates may be transmitted across national boundaries and
through networks, including those owned by third parties.

  



  

Foreign Exchange. If Escrow Agent accepts a funds transfer instruction under
this Agreement for payment in a currency (the "Non-Account Currency") other
than the currency of the account (the "Account Currency"), Escrow Agent is
authorized to enter into a foreign exchange transaction to sell to the Party
or Parties the amount of Non-Account Currency required to complete the funds
transfer and debit the account for the purchase price of the Non-Account
Currency. If Escrow Agent accepts payment to the account in a Non-
Account Currency, Escrow Agent is authorized to purchase the Non-Account
Currency from the Party or Parties, and to credit the purchase price to the
account in lieu of the Non-Account Currency. The purchase price for the
foregoing transactions shall be at a rate and spread as Escrow Agent
determines in its discretion and may differ from rates at which comparable
transactions are entered into with other customers or the range of foreign
exchange rates at which Escrow Agent otherwise enters into foreign exchange
transactions on the relevant date. Further, (i) Escrow Agent has full
discretion to execute such foreign exchange transactions in such manner as
Escrow Agent determines in its sole discretion and (ii) Escrow Agent may
manage the associated risks of Escrow Agent's own position in the market in a
manner it deems appropriate without regard to the impact of such activities on
the Parties. Imbedded within the applicable foreign exchange rate or
otherwise generated in connection with Escrow Agent's execution of any
such transaction or management of its risk related thereto may be a profit to
Escrow Agent. Any such foreign exchange transaction will be between Escrow
Agent and a Party or Parties as principals, and Escrow Agent will not be
acting as agent or fiduciary for the Parties.

  



  

Acknowledgment of Compensation and Multiple Roles. Escrow Agent is authorized
to act under this Agreement notwithstanding that Escrow Agent or any of
its subsidiaries or affiliates (such subsidiaries and affiliates hereafter
individually called an "Affiliate" and collectively called "Affiliates") may
(A) receive fees or derive earnings (float) as a result of providing an
investment product or account on the books of Escrow Agent pursuant to this
Agreement or for providing services or referrals with respect to
investment products, or (B) (i) act in the same transaction in multiple
capacities, (ii) engage in other transactions or relationships with the same
entities to which Escrow Agent may be providing escrow or other services under
this Agreement (iii) refer clients to an Affiliate for services or (iv) enter
into agreements under which referrals of escrow or related transactions are
provided to Escrow Agent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may earn compensation
from any of these activities in addition to the fees charged for services
under this Agreement.

THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED UNDER APPLICABLE U.S.
REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATION D.
WHERE SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS ARE NOTED BELOW, THE DISCLOSURES APPLY ONLY TO
THOSE INVESTMENTS AND NOT TO ANY OTHER INVESTMENT.

  



  

Demand Deposit Account Disclosure. Escrow Agent is authorized, for regulatory
reporting and internal accounting purposes, to divide an escrow demand deposit
account maintained in the U.S. in which the Escrow Funds are held into a non-
interest bearing demand deposit internal account and a non-interest bearing
savings internal account, and to transfer funds on a daily basis between these
internal accounts on Escrow Agent's general ledger in accordance with U.S.
law at no cost to the Parties. Escrow Agent will record the internal accounts
and any transfers between them on Escrow Agent's books and records only. The
internal accounts and any transfers between them will not affect the Fund,
any investment or disposition of the Fund, use of the escrow demand deposit
account or any other activities under this Agreement, except as described
herein. Escrow Agent will establish a target balance for the demand deposit
internal account, which may change at any time. To the extent funds in the
demand deposit internal account exceed the target balance, the excess will be
transferred to the savings internal account, unless the maximum number of
transfers from the savings internal account for that calendar month or
statement cycle has already occurred. If withdrawals from the demand deposit
internal account exceeds the available balance in the demand deposit internal
account, funds from the savings internal account will be transferred to
the demand deposit internal account up to the entire balance of available
funds in the savings internal account to cover the shortfall and to replenish
any target balance that Escrow Agent has established for the demand deposit
internal account. If a sixth transfer is needed during a calendar month or
statement cycle, it will be for the entire balance in the savings
internal account, and such funds will remain in the demand deposit internal
account for the remainder of the calendar month or statement cycle.

  



  

MMDA Disclosure and Agreement. If MMDA is the investment for the escrow
deposit as set forth above or anytime in the future, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that U.S. law limits the number of pre-authorized or automatic
transfers or withdrawals or telephonic/electronic instructions that can be
made from an MMDA to a total of six (6) per calendar month or statement cycle
or similar period. Escrow Agent is required by U.S. law to reserve the right
to require at least seven (7) days' notice prior to a withdrawal from a money
market deposit account.

  



  

Unlawful Internet Gambling. The use of any account to conduct transactions
(including, without limitation, the acceptance or receipt of funds through an
electronic funds transfer, or by check, draft or similar instrument, or the
proceeds of any of the foregoing) that are related, directly or
indirectly, to unlawful Internet gambling is strictly prohibited.

  



  

Use of Electronic Records and Signatures. As used in this Agreement, the
terms "writing" and "written" include electronic records, and the terms
"execute", "signed" and "signature" include the use of electronic
signatures. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the
attached Exhibits, any electronic signature that is presented as the
signature of the purported signer, regardless of the appearance or form of
such electronic signature, may be deemed genuine by Escrow Agent in Escrow
Agent's sole discretion, and such electronic signature shall be of the same
legal effect, validity and enforceability as a manually executed, original,
wet-inked signature; provided, however, that any such electronic
signature must be an actual and not a typed signature. Any electronically
signed agreement shall be an "electronic record" established in the ordinary
course of business and any copy shall constitute an original for all purposes.
The terms "electronic signature" and "electronic record" shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in 15 USC § 7006\. This Agreement and any
instruction or other document furnished hereunder may be transmitted by
facsimile or as a PDF file attached to an email.
