 \t\t\t(ii)Resolution by CPA Firm. If the Seller Representative and the
Purchaser are unable to resolve the Closing Statement Dispute within sixty
(60) calendar days after the delivery of a Closing Statement Objection to the
Purchaser, then at any time thereafter the Seller Representative or the

another nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants as to
which the Seller Representative and Purchaser mutually agree (the "CPA Firm"),
who shall, acting as experts and not as arbitrators, determine on the basis of
the criteria set forth in this Section 2.4, and only with respect to the
remaining accounting-related differences so submitted to the CPA Firm (and not
by independent review), whether and to what extent, if any, the sum of Net
Working Capital plus Recent CapX and Vault Cash Deficiency as derived from the
Proposed Final Closing Statement requires adjustment. In connection with the
engagement of the CPA Firm, each Party shall execute reasonable engagement
letters in the reasonable discretion of the respective parties and supply such
other documents and information as the CPA Firm reasonably requires. Without

consistent with GAAP and the Companies' historical calculation of current
assets and current liabilities and (B) shall not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by any Party, or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by any Party, as presented to
the CPA Firm pursuant hereto. The Proposed Final Closing Statement, as it may
be adjusted by the CPA' Firm's resolution of the Closing Statement Dispute
shall constitute the Final Closing Statement.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii)Payment of Fees of CPA Firm. If the sum of Net Working Capital
plus Recent CapX as reflected on the Final Closing Statement is closer in
amount to the Net Working Capital as reflected in the Closing Statement
Objection (or, if different, the last Net Working Capital proposed in writing
by the Seller Representative as a part of the negotiations conducted pursuant
to Section 2.4(e)(i)) than to the sum of Net Working Capital plus Recent CapX
as reflected on the Proposed Final Closing Statement (or, if different, the
last Net Working Capital proposed in writing by the Purchaser as a part of the
negotiations conducted pursuant to Section 2.4(e)(i), then the Purchaser shall
pay all fees and expenses of the CPA Firm in connection with the services
provided pursuant to Section 2.4(e)(ii). If the sum of Net Working Capital
plus Recent CapX as reflected on the Final Closing Statement is closer in
amount to the sum of Net Working Capital plus Recent CapX as reflected on the
Proposed Final Closing Statement (or, if different, the last Net Working
Capital proposed in writing by the Purchaser as a part of the negotiations
conducted pursuant to Section 2.4(e)(i)) than to the sum of Net Working
Capital plus Recent CapX as reflected in the Closing Statement Objection (or,
if different, the last sum of Net Working Capital plus Recent CapX proposed in
writing by the Seller Representative as a part of the negotiations conducted
pursuant to Section 2.4(e)(i)), then the Seller Representative, on behalf of
the Company Holders shall pay all fees and expenses of the CPA Firm in
connection with the services provided pursuant to Section 2.4(e)(ii), which
shall be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)Cooperation. Each Party agrees that, from and after the Closing
Date, it will not take any actions with respect to the accounting books,
records, policies and procedures of Purchaser or any Company that would
obstruct or prevent the preparation, review or evaluation of the Proposed
Final Closing Statement. Each Party shall cooperate, and shall cause its
Affiliates and designees to cooperate, with the other in the preparation,
review and evaluation of the Proposed Final Closing Statement, including the
provision on a timely basis of all information reasonably necessary or useful

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)The Purchaser acknowledges that it has, prior to its execution of

  \t\t\t\- 32 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

business, properties and personnel of such Company as the Purchaser may
reasonably request, provided that nothing herein shall require any Company to
furnish to Purchaser or provide Purchaser with access to information that
legal counsel for any Company reasonably determines to give rise to antitrust
or competition Law issues. The Purchaser and its authorized representatives
will conduct all such inspections in a manner which will minimize any

the provisions of (A) the letter agreement between the Companies and
Cardtronics, Inc. (as the parent of the Purchaser), dated as of January 22,

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.3Certain Filings. Each Company, the Company Holders and
Purchaser shall make or cause to be made, as promptly as practicable (which
filing shall be made in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date
of this Agreement), all filings with Governmental Entities that are necessary
to obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals for the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including all filings required under applicable
Competition Laws. The Parties agree that the fees of any such filings shall
be paid by the Purchaser to the Governmental Entity but that one-half of the

determining the amount of the Net Purchase Price. The Seller Representative,
on behalf of the Company Holders, and the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) respond to any requests for additional information
made by any Governmental Entities with respect to all filings required under
applicable Competition Laws, (ii) obtain any required approvals of any
Governmental Entities under applicable Competition Laws and (iii) overcome any
objections which may be raised by any Governmental Entity in connection with
Competition Laws; provided, however, the "commercially reasonable efforts" of
any Party shall not be deemed to include (A) divesting or otherwise holding
separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or taking any other
action (or otherwise agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with respect to any
of the businesses, assets or properties of any Party or the Affiliates of any
Party, or (B) entering into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree,
stipulation or agreement with any Governmental Entity that would require any
Party or the Affiliates of any Party to take any action listed in the
preceding clause (A). The Seller Representative, on behalf of the Company
Holders, and Purchaser shall, to the extent reasonably practical, each consult
with the other prior to any meetings, by telephone or in person, with the
staff of any Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated
hereby. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.4Further Action and Reasonable Best Efforts. Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions herein provided, each of the Parties hereto
shall use its reasonable best efforts  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 33 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent to
the obligations of any of the Parties hereto, to obtain all necessary
authorizations, consents and approvals, and to effect all necessary
registrations and filings; provided, however, that such action shall not
include any requirement on the part of Purchaser, the Company Holders, the
Companies or their respective Affiliates to expend money (other than routine
out-of-pocket expenses), commence, defend, or participate in any litigation or
offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any Person (and
Purchaser's obligations under this Section 6.4 are further subject to the
conditions set forth in Section 6.3). Each of the Parties hereto will furnish
to the other Parties such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
such other Parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and
will provide the other Parties with copies of all filings made by such Party
with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such Party
to any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than filings required under applicable
Competition Laws).

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.5Notification. Prior to the Closing, each Company shall
promptly notify the Purchaser (in writing after such Company has notice
thereof), and the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller Representative
(in writing after the Purchaser has notice thereof), and keep such other Party
advised, as to any litigation or administrative proceeding pending and known
to such Party or, to its Knowledge, threatened against such Party that
challenges the transactions contemplated hereby or that affects or relates to
the Equity Seller Units or the Purchased Assets in any manner. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.6Tax Matters. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any real property transfer Tax and any similar Tax) shall
be borne and paid by the Companies and the Seller Representative shall file,
or cause to be filed, all necessary Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable Law, the
Company Holders and the Companies will, and will cause their Affiliates to,
join in the execution of any such Returns and other documentation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)The Seller Representative shall be responsible for preparation and
filing of any Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of the Target
Companies (or with respect to the assets or business of the Target Companies)
for tax periods ending on or before the Closing ("Pre-Closing Returns"). The
Purchaser shall cooperate reasonably with the Seller Representative, to the
extent reasonably necessary, in the preparation of such Pre-Closing Returns,
including by making each Target Company's books and records available for
inspection by the Seller Representative, the Seller Representative's
accountants, auditors and attorneys upon reasonable advance notice. The
Equity Sellers, in accordance with their respective Indemnity Share, shall be
responsible for the payment  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 34 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

of all income Taxes payable by or on behalf of the Target Companies with
respect to the Pre-Closing Returns. Taxes other than income Taxes for each
Target Company for tax periods beginning prior to the Closing and which are
unpaid as of the Closing are to be borne by the Equity Sellers (based on the
express provisions of Section 6.6(b)(ii)) except to the extent taken into
account in calculating Net Working Capital.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)The Purchaser shall be responsible for preparation and filing of
all other Returns required to be filed after the Closing by or on behalf of
the Target Companies (or with respect to the assets or business of the Target
Companies) for tax periods ending after the Closing, and, subject to the
provisions below relating to Straddle Returns, the Purchaser shall be
responsible for the payment of all Taxes payable by or on behalf of the Target
Companies with respect to such Returns. Any such Returns that are for tax
periods beginning before and ending after the Closing ("Straddle Returns")
shall be submitted to the Seller Representative for its review at least 30
days prior to the filing date of such Return (in the case of income Tax
Returns) and at least 15 days prior to the filing date of such Return (in the
case of Returns other than income Tax Returns) and shall not be filed without
the prior approval of the Seller Representative which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If the Seller Representative and the Purchaser cannot
agree on the amount of Taxes owed by any Target Company or the treatment of an
item shown on such Tax Return within fifteen (15) days, the Purchaser and the
Seller Representative shall refer the matter to the CPA Firm. The Purchaser
and the Seller Representative shall each bear 50% of the fees and expenses of
the CPA Firm. The determination of the CPA Firm as to the amount owing by any
Target Company with respect to such Tax Returns shall be binding on both the
Purchaser and the Equity Sellers for purposes of filing such Tax Returns.
Except to the extent taken into account in calculating Net Working Capital,
the Seller Representative, on behalf of and for the account of the Equity
Sellers (in accordance with their respective Indemnity Share), shall reimburse
the Purchaser for that portion of any income Taxes payable by such Target
Company with respect to Straddle Returns that relate to the period ending on
the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 6.6(b), the portion of the
Taxes payable by each Target Company with respect to a Straddle Return that
relates to the period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined, in the
case of Taxes based on income or receipts, based on an interim closing of the
books of such Target Company, and in the case of all other Taxes, by prorating
such Taxes based on a ratio of (A) the number of days in the tax period
through and including the Closing Date to (B) the total number of days in the
tax period; provided, however, that the Equity Sellers shall not be
responsible for any Tax incurred after the Closing Date as a result of any
action by any Target Company or the Purchaser other than in the ordinary
course of the business of such Target Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Allocation of Purchase Price. Each of the Parties further agrees
and acknowledges that the Purchase Price shall be allocated among (i) the
assets of the Target Companies (the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to
each of the assets of the Target Companies shall be increased by the
respective liabilities of the Target Companies as of the Closing) and (ii) the
Purchased Assets (the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the Purchased
Assets shall be increased by the Assumed Liabilities as of the Closing), all
in accordance with the methodology set forth on Schedule 6.6(c) (the "Asset
Allocation"). The portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the assets of
the Target  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 35 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Companies and to the Purchased Assets shall be reflected on a separate Form
8594 filed for each Target Company and each Asset Seller. Unless otherwise
required by applicable Tax Law, for income Tax purposes, the Equity Sellers,
the Asset Sellers and the Purchaser will not, and will cause their respective
Affiliates not to, take a position in any forum that is inconsistent with this
Section 6.6(c) or the Asset Allocation, including taking an inconsistent
position on any Tax Return, before any Governmental Entity charged with the
collection of any Tax, or in any Legal Proceeding relating to any Tax. The
Company Holders and the Purchaser will file all federal, state, local and
foreign income Tax Returns in accordance with Schedule 6.6(c).

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Expected Tax Treatment. The Purchaser and Equity Sellers agree to
treat the purchase and sale of the Equity Seller Units in accordance with
Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432, with the result that (i)
the Equity Sellers shall be treated as selling the Equity Seller Units in a
transaction in which gain or loss is reportable in accordance with Section 741
of the Code, and (ii) the Purchaser shall be treated as purchasing all of the
assets of each Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)Pre-Closing Returns. After the Closing Date, the Seller
Representative shall have the exclusive right to represent the interests of
the Target Companies in any and all Tax audits, assessments or administrative
or court proceedings relating to Pre-Closing Returns; provided, however, that
the Purchaser shall have the right to participate in any such audit,
assessment or proceeding and to employ counsel of its choice for purposes of
such participation. In the event that the Seller Representative proposes to
compromise or settle any Tax claim, or consent or agree to any Tax liability,
relating to a Target Company, the Purchaser shall have the right to review
such proposed compromise, settlement, consent or agreement. Without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, the Seller Representative shall not agree or consent to compromise or
settle any issue or claim arising in any such audit, assessment or proceeding,
or otherwise agree to or consent to any Tax liability, to the extent that any
such compromise, settlement, consent or agreement that would result in a cost
to the Purchaser that is not indemnified pursuant to this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)Straddle Returns. After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall have
the exclusive right to represent the interests of the Target Companies in any
and all Tax audits, assessments or administrative or court proceedings
relating to Tax Returns for Straddle Periods; provided, however, that the
Seller Representative shall have the right to participate in any such audit,
assessment or proceeding and to employ counsel of its choice for purposes of
such participation to the extent that any such audit, assessment or proceeding
would result in an indemnity payment to the Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement. In the event that the Purchaser proposes to compromise or settle
any Tax claim, or consent or agree to any Tax liability, relating to a Target
Company that would result in an indemnity payment to the Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement, the Seller Representative shall have the right to review such
proposed compromise, settlement, consent or agreement. Without the prior
written consent of the Seller Representative, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, the Purchaser shall not agree or consent to compromise or
settle any issue or claim arising in any such audit, assessment  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 36 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

or proceeding, or otherwise agree to or consent to any Tax liability, to the
extent that any such compromise, settlement, consent or agreement that would
result in an indemnity payment to the Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g)Amended Return. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)Upon written request of the Seller Representative, the Purchaser
shall file, or cause to be filed, any amended Tax Return (other than an
amended income Tax Return) for a Target Company or a claim for Tax (other than
income Tax) refund on behalf of such Target Company for any period ending on
or prior to the Closing Date; provided that taking such position will not
subject either the Purchaser or such Target Company to additional Taxes or
reduce any Tax asset or Tax attribute of the Purchaser or such Target Company.
The Purchaser shall permit the Seller Representative to review and comment on
such amended Tax Return prior to filing and the Purchaser shall incorporate
the Seller Representative's reasonable comments. The cost of preparing such
amended Tax Return shall be borne by the Seller Representative. The Purchaser
shall reimburse the Equity Sellers for any Tax refund received with respect to
such amended Tax Return, net of any costs incurred by the Purchaser under this
Section 6.6(g)(i). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)Any amended Tax Return of a Target Company or claim for Tax refund
on behalf of a Target Company for any period ending after the Closing Date
shall be filed, or caused to be filed, only by the Purchaser. The Purchaser
shall not make or cause to be made, any such filing, without the prior written
consent of the Seller Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), to the extent such filing, if accepted,
reasonably might increase the Tax liability of any Company Holder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h)The Purchaser shall not file an election under Treasury regulation
301.7701-3 or any comparable provisions of applicable Law of state or local
jurisdiction to cause a Target Company to be treated as anything other than
partnership for Federal income Tax purposes (or for purposes of such state or
local jurisdiction), where such election has an effective date prior to the
day after the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)The Purchaser shall cause the Target Companies to promptly to remit
to the Seller Representative for the benefit of the Equity Sellers any refunds
of Taxes received attributable to tax periods ending on or before the Closing
except to the extent that such refunds were taken into account in the Net
Working Capital. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j)After the Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Equity Sellers shall
provide each other with such cooperation and information including reasonable
access to any applicable employees relating to the Target Companies as any
other Party may reasonably request in (i) filing any Tax Return, amended Tax
Return or other Tax filing or claim for refund of Taxes, (ii) determining any
Tax liability or right to refund of Taxes, (iii) conducting or defending any
audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes, or (iv) effectuating the terms
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party shall be
unreasonably required to prepare any document, or determine any information,
not then in its possession in response to a request under this Section
6.6(j). \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 37 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(k)Adjustment for Tax Benefits. Any amounts subject to
indemnification by the Equity Sellers hereunder shall be computed net of any
Tax benefits realized by the Purchaser in connection therewith. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.7Employee Benefits. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)The Parties agree to the following provisions related to the
employees of the Companies:  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)Those employees of any Target Company that are listed on Schedule
6.7(a)(i) hereto ("Discontinued Employees"), must be, on or before the Closing
Date, (i) transferred to and employed by Welch Gaming, LLC or (ii) terminated
by the Target Companies as employees of the Target Companies. All costs,
expenses, salary, severance payments, bonus amounts or other payments due or
payable to any Discontinued Employee, and all other expenses or costs
incurred, in connection with the transfer or discharge of the Discontinued
Employees shall be Seller Transaction Expenses for all purposes of this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)The Purchaser hereby undertakes that all individuals who are
employed by a Target Company as of the Closing Date other than Discontinued
Employees (each, a "Continuing Target Employee") shall each remain an employee
of the employing Target Company immediately following the Closing Date.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii)Prior to the Closing Date, the Target Companies shall terminate
the 401(k) Plan effective no later than the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date. The Purchaser shall indemnify the current trustee, Cummins, for
costs and liabilities incurred that may be incurred in connection with
continuing to act as trustee between the Closing Date and final distribution
or transfer of all plan assets, provided that such indemnification shall not
cover liability for the matters disclosed in Section 4.10(d) for which the
Company Holders are indemnifying Purchaser.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv)Except as provided in (i) and (iii) above, the Purchaser hereby
assumes, agrees to honor without modification or contest, and agrees to cause
each Target Company to honor without modification or contest, and to make
required payments when due under, all contracts, agreements, arrangements,
policies, plans and commitments of the Target Companies, including any
compensation arrangements, employment agreements and employee or director
benefit plans, programs and policies, in existence as of the date hereof which
are (x) applicable with respect to any Continuing Target Employee or any
officer or executive of such Target Company, or with respect to any former
employee, officer, or executive of such Target Company and (y) disclosed on
the appropriate Schedule to this Agreement as contemplated by the
representations and warranties set forth in Article IV.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(v)The Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that it shall be
responsible to make all required payments when due for all amounts accrued as
of the Closing Date under the Target Companies' profit sharing and bonus plans
to the extent reflected in the calculation of Net Working Capital. \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 38 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(vi)Not in limitation of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not alter
or reduce the status of any Continuing Target Employee in such a manner as
would have the effect of denying any such Continuing Target Employee credit
for any and all purposes for the Continuing Target Employee's period of
service with any Company prior to the Closing. Neither this Section 6.7 nor
any other provision of this Agreement shall limit the ability or right of
Purchaser or a Target Company to terminate the employment of any of their
respective employees after the Closing Date (subject to any rights of any such
employee pursuant to any contract, agreement, arrangement, policy, plan or
commitment).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(vii)Purchaser shall have no obligation to employ or to provide
benefits to any Person after the Closing Date other than the Continuing Target
Employees. The Parties specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) the
provisions of this Section are not intended to confer any rights or remedies
for the benefit of any employee of the Target Companies and (ii) no Continuing
Target Employee shall be retained as an employee beyond thirty (30) days after
the Closing Date if the Purchaser should determine, in its sole discretion,
that any such Continuing Target Employee does not satisfy the Purchaser's
minimum hiring eligibility requirements as to passing a standard background
check and drug test. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements maintained by or contributed to by the Purchaser (including,
after Closing, each Target Company), the Purchaser shall cause each such plan,
program or arrangement to treat the prior service with any Company and its
Affiliates of each Continuing Target Employee (to the same extent such service
is recognized under analogous plans, programs or arrangements of any Company
or its Affiliates prior to the Closing) as service rendered to the Purchaser,
as the case may be, for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting
thereunder (but not benefit accrual); provided, however, that such crediting
of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of such
benefit. Continuing Target Employees shall also be given credit for any
deductible or co-payment amounts paid in respect of the plan year in which the
Closing occurs, to the extent that, following the Closing, they participate in
any other plan for which deductibles or co-payments are required. The
Purchaser shall also cause each Purchaser Plan (as hereinafter defined below)
to waive any preexisting condition which was waived under the terms of any
Plan immediately prior to the Closing or waiting period limitation which would
otherwise be applicable to a Continuing Target Employee on or after the
Closing. The Purchaser shall recognize any accrued but unused vacation of the
Continuing Target Employees as of the Closing Date, and the Purchaser shall
cause each Target Company to provide such paid vacation. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Purchaser Plan" shall mean any employee benefit plan, as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or whatever nonqualified employee benefit or
deferred compensation plan, stock option, bonus or incentive plan or other
employee benefit or fringe benefit program, that may be in effect generally
for employees of the Purchaser from time to time. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Except as provided in this Section 6.7, nothing in this Agreement
shall limit or restrict in any way the rights of the Purchaser or any Company
to modify, amend,  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 39 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

terminate or establish employee benefit plans or arrangements, in whole or in
part, at any time after the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)The Purchaser shall comply with, and shall be responsible for all
liabilities or obligations under, the WARN Act, with respect to all Continuing
Target Employees from the actions of the Purchaser or any Company following
the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)The Target Companies shall, prior to or within a reasonable period
after the Closing, but in no event later than final distribution of the assets
of the 401(k) Plan, commence a compliance statement through the Internal
Revenue Service's Voluntary Compliance Program (as set forth in Rev. Proc.
2013-12) to correct the 401(k) Plan's compliance exceptions identified in
Schedule 4.10(d). The Target Companies shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the plan's third party administrator to pay all out-of-pocket
costs of the Voluntary Compliance Program application. To the extent that the
costs and expenses of preparing and submitting such application (including the
application fee) are not paid by the plan's third party administrator or
another third party, the Company Holders shall pay for, from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, the cost for the preparation of the Voluntary Compliance Program
application with the cooperation of the Target Companies, and the Seller
Representative may designate counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Purchaser. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.8Publicity. None of the Company Holders, the Companies, the
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
consultation of the other party, except as may be required by law or by any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which cases the
other party shall be advised and the parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be
issued. \t\t

 \t\t

which does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Purchaser or
its Affiliates. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)If originals or copies of any Records, articles, objects or things,
are required to respond to legal process in connection with the conduct or

cause each of the Target Companies (and any of its successors) not to, for
such period, amend, or cause to be amended, any provision in the articles of
organization, limited liability company operating agreement or any other
organizational document of such Target Company if the effect of any such
amendment would impair or inhibit any right to indemnification for acts and
omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date now existing in favor of
the current or former managers and/or officers of such Target Company.

of their respective successors or assigns, consolidates with or merges into

assets to any Person, then, and in each case, the Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such successors and assigns of the
Purchaser or the applicable Target Company, as the case may be, to honor the

shall not, and shall cause each Target Company not to, at any time within
ninety days after the Closing Date, effectuate (i) a "plant closing" (as
defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "WARN Act")) affecting

agreement, to wit, that they are operated in their current locations (as of

conjunction with a video gambling terminal, video lottery terminal or other

prior to the Closing Date or (II) made operational in a Gaming Dispenser
installed after the Closing Date at a location where one of the Companies or
Purchaser does not then have an ATM installed at the same location, and if

both (w) required by the terms of the contract governing the provision and
operation of the Gaming Redemption Functionality and (x) exclusively operated
and made available at the same location as, and in connection with the
operation of, the Gaming Redemption Functionality. A Permitted Gaming Cash
Dispenser with Account Cash Functionality may not be installed from and after
the Closing Date through the end of the four (4) year anniversary of the
Closing Date at any location where one of the Companies or Purchaser also then
has an ATM installed, and any Permitted Gaming Cash Dispenser installed during
that period at a location where one of the Companies or Purchaser does not
then have an ATM installed at the same location may only include Account Cash
Functionality if prior notice is provided to the Purchaser and during that
period exclusively utilizes WSILC or its Affiliates for the processing of
transactions.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)For a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, the Company
Holders shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly: (i) cause, solicit, induce or encourage any employees of the
Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries (including the Target Companies) to leave
such employment; provided, however, this restriction shall not prohibit
general solicitations for employment not specifically targeted at such
employees; or (ii) cause, induce or encourage any material actual customer or
supplier of the Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries or any other Person who
has a material business relationship with the Purchaser or any of its
subsidiaries, to terminate or modify any such relationship. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)For a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, the Company
Holders shall not and shall cause their Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person other than
authorized officers, directors and employees of Purchaser or use or otherwise
exploit for its own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than Purchaser,
any Confidential Information (as defined below). The Company Holders shall
not have any obligation to keep confidential (or cause its officers, directors
or Affiliates to keep confidential) any Confidential Information if and to the
extent disclosure thereof is specifically required by applicable Law, subpoena
or other judicial process; provided, however, that in the event disclosure is
required by applicable Law, subpoena or other judicial process, the Company
Holders shall, to the extent reasonably possible, provide Purchaser with
prompt notice of such requirement prior to making any disclosure so that
Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective order at Purchaser's sole cost.
For purposes of this Section 6.14(c), "Confidential Information" means any
proprietary information with respect to any Company that has economic
 \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

value, including methods of operation, customer lists, products, prices, fees,
costs, Technology, inventions, trade secrets, know-how, Software, marketing
methods, plans, personnel, suppliers, competitors, markets, any compilation of
information, data, records, resources or documents that the Companies have
assembled and treat as confidential, or other specialized information or
proprietary matters. "Confidential Information" does not include, and there
shall be no obligation hereunder with respect to, information that (i) is
generally available to the public on the date of this Agreement, (ii) becomes
generally available to the public after the date of this Agreement other than
as a result of a disclosure not otherwise permissible hereunder, or (iii)
becomes available on a nonconfidential basis from a third party not bound by a
confidentiality agreement or any legal, fiduciary or other obligation
restricting disclosure.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)The covenants and undertakings contained in this Section 6.14
relate to matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character
and a violation of the terms of this Section 6.14 will cause irreparable
injury to Purchaser, the amount of which will be difficult to estimate or
determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy
at law for any breach of this Section 6.14 will be inadequate. Therefore,
Purchaser may be entitled to a temporary and permanent injunction, restraining
order or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in
the event of a breach of this Section 6.14 without the necessity of proving
actual damage. The rights and remedies provided by this Section 6.14 are
cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser
may have hereunder or at law or in equity. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)The parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent
jurisdiction determines that a specified time period, a specified geographical
area, or a specified business limitation of this Section 6.14 is unreasonable,
arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser period of time, geographical
area, or business limitation which is determined by such court to be
reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced
against the applicable party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)Solely for purposes of this Section 6.14, the term "Affiliates"
shall mean, when applied to Rock Island Capital Fund I, L.P. and Rock Island
Capital Q Fund I, L.P. (the "Rock Island Entities"), only those Affiliates of
the Rock Island Entities that are controlled by one or both of the Rock Island
Entities and not those Affiliates of the Rock Island Entities that control or
are under common control with one or both of the Rock Island Entities.  \t\t

EFT Accounts on or after the Closing Date. At the Closing, the Asset Sellers
shall provide, in a separate document, the login id, the password and such
other access codes as may be necessary to give Purchaser or WSILC online
access to the EFT Accounts. \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)The Asset Sellers shall use best efforts to transfer title to the
EFT Accounts to WSILC by Closing. Notwithstanding the fact that the EFT
Accounts may remain titled in the name of the Asset Sellers after the Closing
Date, Purchaser is expressly authorized and empowered, from and after the
Closing Date, to direct the authorized signatories on the EFT Accounts to (i)
transfer, withdraw or otherwise use any of such cash on deposit from time to
time in the EFT Accounts as Purchaser may choose, (ii) issue checks, drafts or
other payment instruments that draw upon or utilize the cash balances in the
EFT Accounts and (iii) close the EFT Accounts and provide directions as to how
any remaining cash balances in the EFT Accounts shall be disbursed.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)From and after the Closing Date, without the express prior written
consent of the Purchaser, the Asset Sellers shall not exercise any right or
power as the legally titled owner of the EFT Accounts, including, without
limitation, any of the following rights or powers: (i) changing the authorized
signatories on the EFT Accounts, (ii) requesting or directing the disposition
of any funds on deposit in the EFT Accounts, (iii) changing the password,
login id or other access code for online access to the EFT Accounts or (iv)

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.16Mail. Each of the Asset Sellers authorizes and empowers
the Purchaser on and after the Closing Date to receive and open all mail
received by the Purchaser relating to the ATM business or the Purchased Assets
and to deal with the contents of such communications in any proper manner.
The Asset Sellers shall promptly deliver to the Purchaser any mail or other
communication received by them after the Closing Date pertaining to the ATM
business or the Purchased Assets. The Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the
Asset Sellers any mail or other communication received by it after the Closing
Date pertaining to the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities. \t\t

Holders and Asset Sellers agrees that (A) neither it, nor any of its
Affiliates, shall use the names, trademarks, slogans, trade names, logos or
labels included in the Purchased Assets and (B) any license or other right
previously granted by any of the Target Companies, any of the Company Holders
or any Affiliate of a Company Holder purporting to grant any right or interest
in or to the names, trademarks, slogans, trade names, logos or labels owned or
used by the Target Companies shall be terminated as of the Closing Date
without any further action required by any party thereto. Each of the Asset
Sellers, Company Holders and their Affiliates shall take such action as
necessary to (i) change its name within thirty (30) days after the Closing
Date to a name that does not make use of, or that is confusingly similar to,
any of the names, trademarks, slogans, trade names, logos or labels included
in the Purchased Assets and (ii) maintain its corporate existence in good
standing for at least one year after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Welch Systems, Inc. shall have the right to continue to use the
name "Welch" in its name in a manner consistent with past practices and in
connection with the business of (x) providing repair and technical services
for bank equipment and ATMs and (y) engaging in the sale, installation,
maintenance and repair of banking equipment, including ATMs. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.18Non-Assigned Assets. If the legal interest in any of the
Purchased Assets, or any claim, right or benefit arising under or resulting
from the Purchased Assets, cannot be  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 46 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed on the Closing Date because any
waiting or notice period has not expired or any required consents or approvals
have not been obtained or waived, then the legal interest in such Purchased
Assets will not be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed until such waiting
or notice period shall have expired or until the necessary approval, consent
or waiver is obtained, and each Asset Seller will, at its expense, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents, approvals or waivers
as soon as practicable. Nothing in this Agreement may be construed as an
attempt to assign to the Purchaser any legal interest in any of the Purchased
Assets that, as a matter of law or by the terms of any contract to which an
Asset Seller is subject, is not assignable without the consent of any other
party, unless such consent is given. Pending such assignments, conveyances
and transfers, each Asset Seller will hold any such non-assigned Purchased
Assets for the benefit of the Purchaser and will cooperate with the Purchaser
in any lawful and reasonable arrangements designed to provide the benefits of
ownership thereof to the Purchaser. \t\t

Companies and the Equity Sellers will take such actions and execute such
documents as may be necessary to transfer, assign, convey and deliver the
Excluded Autos to a Person other than the Target Companies, with no adjustment
to the Purchase Price. Without limiting the foregoing, each Target Company
shall, prior to the Closing, take such actions as are necessary to result in
the certificate of title for each Excluded Auto to be transferred and re-
issued in the name of the transferee of each such Excluded Auto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.20Cooperation Regarding Vault Cash Borrowings. From the
date of this Agreement and continuing through and until the Closing, the
Companies shall, at the request of the Purchaser, (i) provide the Purchaser
with introductions to the appropriate account officers of the financial
institutions that have provided the Vault Cash Borrowings and (ii) cooperate
reasonably with the Purchaser's efforts to make arrangements, in advance of
the Closing, for the release at the Closing of the Liens that secure the Vault
Cash Borrowings. Purchaser will offer to provide substitute cash collateral
or letters or credit to the lender under the United Community Vault Line in
order to obtain a release of the Liens securing the United Community Vault
Line. If such lender declines to release such Liens, then Purchaser will
repay all amounts borrowed on the United Community Vault Line and thereby
acquire ownership at the Closing of all of the cash borrowed thereunder. If
the amounts borrowed under the United Community Vault Line are not repaid by
the Purchaser at Closing, the Purchaser will use reasonable effort to cause
the Asset Sellers and its owners to be released from liability on the United
Community Vault Line, notwithstanding that Purchaser indemnifies the Asset
Sellers and their owners under Section 9.3 with respect to the United
Community Vault Line (except to the extent of a Vault Cash Deficiency) as an
Assumed Liability. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.21Efforts to Obtain Certain Consents. From the date of this

the Purchaser from the counterparties to each agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
guarantee, lease, license, agreement or other instrument or obligation listed
on Schedule 4.3 except to the extent (i) any such consent has been obtained
prior to the date hereof or (ii) such agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
guarantee, lease, license, agreement or other  \t\t

the Seller Representative, on behalf of the Company Holders; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)by any of the Companies, the Seller Representative, on behalf of
the Company Holders, or the Purchaser, if any Governmental Entity shall have

such statute, order, decree, regulation or other action shall have become
final and non-appealable; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)by the Seller Representative, on behalf of the Company Holders, if

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Except for breaches of the Fundamental Representations, Section
4.12 (Tax Matters) or Section 4.13 (Environmental Matters) and fraud by the
Company Holders, none of the Company Holders or the Purchaser, as the case may
be, shall be liable for Damages arising in connection with its indemnification
obligations under Section 9.2(i) or Section 9.3(i) hereof until the amount of
Damages incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties or the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, exceeds $750,000 in the aggregate and
then only to the extent of such excess (i.e. a true deductible, not a "tipping
basket"). \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 52 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Except for breaches of Fundamental Representations, Statutory

shall in aggregate have no indemnification obligations to the Purchaser for
any liability under this Agreement (including without limitation Section 2.2
and Section 9.2) in excess of $24,000,000 (the "Indemnification Cap"). In
addition to the foregoing limits, the Company Holders' aggregate
indemnification obligations to the Purchaser for any liability with respect to
the matters in Schedule 9.2 alone shall not exceed the limits set forth
therein, and no Company Holder shall be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser
in an amount which exceeds such Company Holder's Indemnity Share of the
Indemnification Cap, except for breaches of Fundamental Representations or
Statutory Representations or fraud of the Company Holders. With respect to
the Fundamental Representations and the Statutory Representations, the Company
Holders shall have no indemnification obligations to the Purchaser in
aggregate for any liability arising hereunder in excess of the Purchase Price,
less all other payments made for indemnification obligations from the
Indemnity Escrow or on account of Section 4.22. With respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.22 (Data Privacy and
Security), the Company Holders shall have no indemnification obligations to
the Purchaser in aggregate for any liability arising hereunder in excess of
$48,000,000. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.5Other Limitations. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)The amount of any Damages suffered by a Seller Indemnified Party or
a Purchaser Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall be reduced by any
third-party insurance or other indemnification benefits which such party or
any of its representatives receives in respect of or as a result of such
Damages. If any Damages for which indemnification is provided hereunder are
subsequently reduced by any third-party insurance or other indemnification
benefit, recovery, the amount of the reduction shall be remitted to the Seller
Indemnified Party or Purchaser Indemnified Party, as the case may be. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the case
of any Damages or any alleged Damages arising hereunder as to which any Target
Company is entitled to indemnification pursuant to any asset purchase
agreement pursuant to which any Target Company acquired assets, the Purchaser
shall proceed (or shall cause such Target Company to proceed) directly against
the indemnitors thereunder and shall use its best efforts to enforce the
rights of any Target Company under those agreements before making any claim
against the Company Holders hereunder; provided, that the Seller
Representative shall cooperate reasonably with the Purchaser in making any
such claim thereunder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)No Action for indemnification, reimbursement or any other remedy
pursuant to this Article may be brought with respect to breaches of
representations and warranties contained herein after the applicable
Expiration Date; provided, however, that, if, prior to the applicable
Expiration Date, an Indemnified Party shall have notified the Indemnifying
Party in writing of a specific claim for indemnification under this Article
and such notice identifies the nature of such claim with reasonable
specificity, such  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 53 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be indemnified with respect to such
claim in accordance with this Article notwithstanding the occurrence of such
Expiration Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event
shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification for Damages
pursuant to this Article IX to the extent any Damages were attributable to
such Indemnified Party's own gross negligence or willful misconduct. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.6Notice and Payment of Claims. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Notice. An Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party
(with reasonable specificity) promptly after it becomes aware of facts
supporting an Action for indemnification under this Article, and shall provide
to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable thereafter all information
and documentation necessary to support and verify any Damages associated with
such Action. The failure to so notify or provide information to the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability
that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been actually prejudiced by the
Indemnified Party's failure to give such notice, in which case the
Indemnifying Party shall be relieved from its obligations hereunder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Payment. In the event an Action for indemnification under this
Article shall have been Finally Determined, the amount of the related Damages
shall be paid by the Company Holders, or the Purchaser, as the case may be, to
the Seller Indemnified Party or the Purchaser Indemnified Party, as the case
may be, in immediately available funds in U.S. dollars within five (5)
business days after such Final Determination. For purposes of this Agreement,
the terms "Finally Determined," "Final Determination" and other similar
phrases shall mean with respect to any Action, and the liability for and
amount of Damages therefor, when the parties to such Action have so determined
by mutual agreement or, if disputed, when a final, non-appealable decision has
been rendered in accordance with Article IX hereof.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Third-Party Claims. In the event that the Indemnifying Party may
be required to indemnify an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article against
any Action made or brought by a third-party (a "Third-Party Claim"),
indemnification shall be provided in accordance with the following
procedures: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)Upon receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of the commencement
of a Third-Party Claim against it, such Indemnified Party shall, if an Action
is to be made against the Indemnifying Party under this Article, give notice
to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of such Third-Party Claim as
soon as practicable, but in no event later than five (5) days after the
Indemnified Party shall have been served with process, but the failure to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that its defense of such Third-Party Claim
has been actually prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to give  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 54 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

such notice, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved from its
obligations hereunder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)If a Third-Party Claim is brought against an Indemnified Party and
it gives proper notice to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of such
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled (unless the Action
involves Taxes in which case defense will be handled as set forth in Section
6.6 hereof or unless the Indemnifying Party is also a party to such Third-
Party Claim except if the Indemnifying Party determines in good faith that
joint representation would be appropriate) to assume the control of defense of
such Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, as long as it conducts such defense, be liable
to the Indemnified Party under this Article IX for any fees of other counsel
or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim,
in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense of such Third-Party Claim. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii)If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, no compromise, discharge or settlement of or admission of liability in
connection with such Third-Party Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying
Party without the Indemnified Party's consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (A) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party (if such
claim by the Indemnified Party for indemnification is successful) or (B) such
settlement does not include terms other than monetary Damages which in the
good faith judgment of the Indemnifying Party could significantly adversely
affect such Target Company's business operations after the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.7Tax Consequences. Any indemnity payment made under this
Article shall be deemed to be an adjustment in the Purchase Price. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.8Remedy. Except for seeking equitable relief or claims
based on fraud, from and after the Closing the sole remedy of either party in
connection with a breach of the representations and warranties in this
Agreement or a breach or violation of, or failure to perform, any covenant,
agreement or obligation in this Agreement, shall be as set forth in this
Article IX. The eligible funds in the Indemnity Escrow account shall be the
primary source of recovery with respect to any indemnity claim made hereunder
by Purchaser, and no demand shall be made on Company Holders except to the
extent in excess of funds available in the Indemnity Escrow. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.9Powers of Attorney. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Each Company Holder and Asset Seller irrevocably constitutes and
appoints Rock Island Capital Fund I, L.P. as such Company Holder's true and
lawful agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact and agent (the "Seller
Representative") and authorizes the Seller Representative acting for such
Company Holder and in such Company Holder's name, place and stead, in any and
all capacities to do and perform every act and thing required or permitted to
be done by such Company Holder or the Seller  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 55 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Representative hereunder or otherwise in connection with the agreements and
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as fully to all intents and
purposes as such Person might or could do in person, including, without
limitation: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)determine the presence (or absence) and direct payment of proceeds
of claims for indemnification against the Purchaser pursuant to Article
IX; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)deliver all notices required to be delivered by such Company
Holder under this Agreement, including, without limitation, any notice of a
claim for which indemnification is sought under Article IX; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii)receive all notices required to be delivered to such Company
Holder under this Agreement, including, without limitation, any notice of a
claim for which indemnification is sought under Article IX; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv)take any and all action on behalf of such Company Holder from time
to time as the Seller Representative may deem necessary or desirable to
defend, pursue, resolve and/or settle disputes or claims under this Agreement,
including, without limitation, disputes regarding the Proposed Final Closing
Statement or the calculation of the sum of the Net Working Capital plus Recent
CapX and Cash Vault Deficiency under Section 2.4(e) and claims for
indemnification under Article IX; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(v)consent on behalf of the Company Holders with respect to matters
under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(vi)engage and employ, at the expense of the Company Holders, agents
and representatives (including accountants, legal counsel and other
professionals) and to incur such other expenses as it deems necessary or
prudent in connection with the administration of the foregoing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Each Company Holder grants unto said attorney-in-fact and agent
full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing
necessary or desirable to be done in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as fully to all intents and purposes as the
undersigned might or could do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming all
that the Seller Representative may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue
hereof. Each Company Holder agrees that such agency, proxy and power of
attorney are coupled with an interest, and are therefore irrevocable without
the consent of the Seller Representative and Purchaser and shall survive the
death, incapacity, or bankruptcy of such Company Holder. Each Company Holder
acknowledges and agrees that upon execution of this Agreement, any delivery by
the Seller Representative of any waiver, amendment, agreement, opinion,
certificate or other documents executed by the Seller Representative or any
decisions made by the Seller Representative pursuant to this Section 9.9, such
Company Holder shall be bound by such documents or decision as fully as if
such Company Holder had executed and delivered such documents or made such
decisions. Company Holders shall reimburse, in accordance with their
respective Indemnity Share, all costs incurred by the Seller Representative in
acting as Seller  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 56 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Representative and for all payments made on behalf of the Company Holders
under this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Liability. The Seller Representative shall not have by reason of
this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Company Holder,
except in respect of amounts received on behalf of such Company Holder. The
Seller Representative shall not be liable to any Company Holder for any action
taken or omitted by it or any agent employed by it hereunder or under any
other document or instrument contemplated hereby, or in connection therewith,
except that the Seller Representative shall not be relieved of any liability
imposed by law for gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Seller
Representative shall not be liable to any of the Company Holders for any
apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith, and if any
such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been
made in error the sole recourse of any Company Holder to whom payment was due,
but not made, shall be to recover from other Company Holders any payment in
excess of the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled. The
Seller Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning
either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or
conditions of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Replacement of the Seller Representative. Each Company Holder
acknowledges and agrees that, upon the dissolution, liquidation, termination,
bankruptcy or other incapacity of the initial Seller Representative appointed
pursuant to Section 9.9(a), Rock Island Capital, LLC shall be succeed to the
responsibility and authority of the initial Seller Representative. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)Actions of the Seller Representative. Each Company Holder agrees
that Purchaser shall be entitled to rely on any action taken by the Seller
Representative, on behalf of the Company Holders, pursuant to Section 9.9(a)
above (each, an "Authorized Action"), and that each Authorized Action shall be
binding on each Company Holder as fully as if such Company Holder had taken
such Authorized Action. Purchaser agrees that the Seller Representative shall
have no liability to Purchaser for any Authorized Action, except to the extent
that such Authorized Action is found by a final order of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have constituted fraud or willful misconduct. Company Holders
agree, jointly and severally, to pay, and to indemnify and hold harmless,
Purchaser from and against any losses which they may suffer, sustain, or
become subject to, as the result of any claim by any Person that an Authorized
Action is not binding on, or enforceable against, the Company Holders. In
addition, the Company Holders hereby release and discharge Purchaser, each
Company and each of their respective Affiliates from and against any liability
arising out of or in connection with the Seller Representative's failure to
distribute any amounts received by the Seller Representative on the Company
Holders' behalf to the Company Holders. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.10Purchaser Reliance. By execution hereof, Seller
Representative agrees to accept payment of the Purchase Price and any other
cash consideration hereunder, from time to time, on behalf of the Company
Holders and to promptly disburse to the Equity Sellers and the Asset Sellers
their respective Distributive Share thereof, net of (i) any applicable fees
and expenses, including applicable fees of expenses of the Seller
Representative arising out of or in  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 57 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

connection with the acceptance or administration of the Seller
Representative's duties hereunder (and such reserves for contingencies as
Seller Representative may deem necessary or appropriate) and (ii) adjustments
to take account of the portion of the Net Working Capital attributable to the
Target Companies (to be charged or credited to the Equity Sellers) and the
Asset Sellers (to be charged or credited to the Company Holders in the Asset
Sellers) as reasonably determined by the Seller Representative. The Purchaser
shall be entitled to rely on the full power and authority of Seller
Representative to act hereunder and under any Exhibit or Schedule hereto on
behalf of the Company Holders, and shall not be liable in any way whatsoever
for any action the Purchaser takes or omits to take in reliance upon such
power and authority. The Company Holders shall look solely to the Seller
Representative for payment of their Distributive Share of the cash
consideration paid to Seller Representative by the Purchaser, less payments
made or costs incurred by the Seller Representative on their behalf, and they
shall have no recourse against Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or agents
for payment thereof; provided, however, that this sentence shall in no way
limit the Company Holders' or the Seller Representative's power to enforce any
of the Company Holders' rights hereunder.

 \t\t\tSection 10.3Interpretation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to vary the definition of
"Material Adverse Effect" or to imply that such amount, higher or lower
amounts, or the term so included or other items, are or are not material, and
neither party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 59 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in any Schedule is or is not material for the purposes of this
Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically provides otherwise, neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any
Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items
or matters, are or are not in the Ordinary Course of Business, and no party
shall use the fact of the setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or
matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in any Schedule is
or is not in the Ordinary Course of Business for purposes of this Agreement.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)For purposes of this Agreement, words in the singular shall be held
to include the plural and vice versa, and words of one gender shall be held to
include the other gender as the context requires. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The terms "hereof,"
"herein" and "hereto" shall be interpreted to refer to this Agreement in its
entirety and to all of the Schedules and not to any particular provision,
unless otherwise stated. The use of the phrase "reasonable best efforts" in
provisions relating to the obligations of the parties to seek required
consents and approvals of any Person shall in no event contemplate payment of
any amount to such Person that is more than minimal or the incurrence of any
liability or the agreement to the modification of any existing obligation or
arrangement in a manner that would be adverse in any material respect to any
party hereto in order to obtain any such consent or approval. The phrase
"made available" when used in this Agreement shall mean that the information
referred to has been made available if requested by the party to whom such
information is to be made available. The term "Affiliate" when used in this
Agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Rule 12b-2 under the
Exchange Act. The phrase "beneficial ownership" and words of similar import
when used in this Agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.4Headings; Schedules. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, such
reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)To the extent any matter disclosed pursuant to any Schedule of the
Disclosure Schedule reasonably appears on its face to be applicable to another
Schedule of the Disclosure Schedule such disclosure shall be deemed to be
disclosed in such other Schedule but such disclosure shall not be deemed to be
an admission or representation as to the materiality of the item so
disclosed. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)The Company Holders and the Companies shall have the right, by
written notice to Purchaser, from time to time prior to the Closing to
supplement, amend or update the Disclosure Schedule (a "Schedule Update") to
reflect facts, events or  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 60 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

circumstances that occur after the date hereof that would have otherwise been
appropriate to include in any section of the Disclosure Schedule. Any
Schedule Update shall not be effective for purposes of applying the provisions
of Section 7.3(a); however, if the Closing occurs after Purchaser's receipt
of any Schedule Update in accordance with and as permitted by the immediately
preceding sentence, then such Schedule Update will be effective to cure and
correct for all purposes any breach of any representation or warranty that
would have existed if the Company Holders and the Companies had not made such
Schedule Update.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.5Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.6Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings (written and oral), among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.7Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory
policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.8Damages; Specific Performance. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth herein, in no event shall any party hereto be
entitled to any punitive, incidental, indirect, special or consequential
damages or loss of profits resulting from or arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. Further, the parties acknowledge and
agree that any breach of the terms of this Agreement would give rise to
irreparable harm for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy and
accordingly the parties agree that each shall be entitled to enforce the terms
of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance without the necessity of
proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.9Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT GIVING

 \t\t\t(a)All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be heard and determined in the federal courts located in
Harris County, Texas, and the Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the
jurisdiction of such courts in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably
waive the defense of an inconvenient forum. Each Party irrevocably consents
to the service of any and all process in any such action or proceeding by the
mailing of copies of such process to such Party at its address specified in
Section 10.2. Nothing in this Section 10.10 shall affect the right of any
Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. The
consents to jurisdiction set  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 61 -  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

forth in this Section 10.10 shall not constitute general consents to service
of process in the State of Texas and shall have no effect for any purpose
except as provided in this Section 10.10 and shall not be deemed to confer
rights on any person other than the Parties.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT
SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH SUCH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii)
EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS Section 10.10(b). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.11Conflicts and Privilege. It is acknowledged by each of
the Parties that the Companies, the Company Holders, and the Seller
Representative have retained McDermott Will and Emery LLP ("McDermott"), to act
as their counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Purchaser hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between the Purchaser or any of the Companies, on the one hand, and
the Seller Representative or any of the Company Holders on the other hand,
McDermott may represent the Seller Representative and Company Holders in such
dispute, even though the interests of the Seller Representative and Company
Holders may be directly adverse to the Companies, and even though McDermott
may have represented one or more of the Companies in a matter substantially
related to such dispute. The Purchaser further agrees that, as to all
communications among McDermott, the Companies, the Seller Representative
and/or any Company Holders that relate in any way to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to the Seller Representative and the
Company Holders and may be controlled by the Seller Representative and Company
Holders and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Purchaser or the Companies
after the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Purchaser and the Companies on the one hand and a third
party other than the Seller Representative or any Company Holder, on the other
hand, the Purchaser and the Companies may assert the attorney-client privilege
to prevent disclosure of confidential communications to such third party;
provided, however, that neither the Purchaser or the Companies may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative
(which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.12Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall

COMPANIES AND THEIR ASSETS AND OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY HOLDERS MAKE NO

IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. The Purchaser acknowledges that no other
Person has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the
accuracy or completeness of any memoranda, charts, summaries or schedules
heretofore made available to the Purchaser by the Company Holders or the
Companies or any of their respective representatives or any other information
which is not included in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule. Neither

Person will have or be subject to any liability to the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or any other Person resulting from the distribution of any such
information to, or use of any such information by, the Purchaser, any of its
Affiliates, agents, accountants, counsel, or other representatives. \t\t
