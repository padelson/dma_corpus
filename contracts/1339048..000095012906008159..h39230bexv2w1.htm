payment of the Merger Consideration. On or before the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit (or cause
to be deposited) the Merger Consideration (such cash consideration being hereinafter referred to as
the &#147;<U>Merger Fund</U>&#148;) with the Paying Agent. The Merger Fund shall not include Per Share
Merger Consideration for any Dissenting Shares, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall not be
entitled to receive payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration related to such Dissenting Shares

customary form and specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall
otherwise be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) containing
instructions for use by holders of Certificates to effect the exchange of their Certificates for
the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided herein. As soon as practicable after the Effective
