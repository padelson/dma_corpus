AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of August 26, 2006, is among WESTERN REFINING, INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), NEW ACQUISITION CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and a direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and GIANT INDUSTRIES, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), whereby each share of capital stock of the Company issued and outstanding prior to the Merger will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration provided for herein; 

  

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has determined that the Merger is fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement; 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE 1 
 THE MERGER 

   

 SECTION 1.1 _THE MERGER_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger and shall be a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Parent. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the Delaware General Corporation Law (" _DGCL_ "). 

  

 SECTION 1.2 _THE CLOSING_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (a) at the offices of Andrews Kurth LLP, 600 Travis, Suite 4200, Houston, Texas 77002, at 9:00 a.m., local time, on the first business day immediately following the day on which the last to be fulfilled or waived of the conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be fulfilled or waived in accordance herewith or (b) at such other time, date or place as Parent and the Company may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_." 

  

 SECTION 1.3 _EFFECTIVE TIME_. If all the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 6 shall have been fulfilled or waived in accordance herewith and this Agreement shall not 

   ##### 

  

    

have been terminated as provided in ARTICLE 7, on the Closing Date, a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") meeting the
requirements of Section 251 of the DGCL shall be properly executed and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL, or at such later
time that the parties hereto shall have agreed upon and designated in such
filing as the effective time of the Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 SECTION 1.4 _CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company (other than the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of the Company setting forth the name of the Company and the incorporator of the Company, which shall not be amended), shall be amended to read as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until duly amended in accordance with applicable law. 

  

 SECTION 1.5 _BYLAWS_. The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until duly amended in accordance with applicable law. 

  

 SECTION 1.6 _DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS_. The directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of the directors and officers of Merger Sub, as it existed immediately prior to the Effective Time, until changed in accordance with applicable law. 

  

ARTICLE 2 
 CONVERSION OF THE COMPANY SHARES 

   

 SECTION 2.1 _EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the following effects on the capital stock of the Company and Merger Sub, without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _Conversion of the Company Shares_. Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (each a " _Share_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares (i) held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary (as defined in Section 8.9) of Parent, (ii) in the treasury of the Company or (iii) held by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, which Shares, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist with no payment being made with respect thereto, and other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.3)) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive US$83.00, without interest, in cash (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). The aggregate amount of the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of all Shares entitled thereto is referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_." The holder of a certificate that represented Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificate, the Per Share Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 2.1(a). 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Shares_. As of the Effective Time, all Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall no longer 

   ##### 

  

    

be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Per Share
Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares formerly represented
by the Certificate, to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2. 

  

 (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall thereby become a wholly-owned, direct Subsidiary of Parent. 

  

 SECTION 2.2 _DEPOSIT; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_  

  

 (a) _Deposit_. On the first business day after the date hereof, Parent shall deposit $12,500,000 (the " _Deposit_ ") into an escrow account with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") pursuant to an Escrow Agreement of even date among the Company, Parent and the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Deposit shall be increased to $25,000,000 if the Closing has not occurred on or before November 30, 2006 because the condition set forth in Section 6.1(b) has not been satisfied. As provided in the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall pay the Deposit to the Paying Agent (as defined below) to be applied towards the Merger Consideration at the Closing, or if this Agreement is terminated, to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, as provided in Section 7.5(b). 

  

 (b) _Paying Agent; Payment of Merger Consideration_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. On or before the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) the Merger Consideration (such cash consideration being hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger Fund_ ") with the Paying Agent. The Merger Fund shall not include Per Share Merger Consideration for any Dissenting Shares, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to receive payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration related to such Dissenting Shares from the Merger Fund. The Merger Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

  

 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but not later than five (5) business days after the date on which the Effective Time occurs), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or deliver to each Person (as defined in Section 8.9) who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares and whose Shares are being converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article 2 a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall otherwise be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) containing instructions for use by holders of Certificates to effect the exchange of their Certificates for the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided herein. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of an outstanding Certificate or Certificates shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate or Certificates and such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto (together with such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) and acceptance thereof by the Paying Agent (or, if such 

   ##### 

  

    

Shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry
through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such Shares on a
book-entry account statement (it being understood that any references herein
to " _Certificates_ " shall be deemed to include references to book-
entry account statements relating to the ownership of Shares)), be entitled
to an amount of cash (payable by check) equal to the Per Share Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate or Certificates. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. If cash is to be remitted to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered for exchange is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes
(as defined in Section 8.9) required by reason of the payment of the Per
Share Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Certificate so surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(c), at any time after the
Effective Time, each Certificate shall be deemed to represent only the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration upon such surrender. No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable as Per Share
Merger Consideration. 

  

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights_. All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates formerly representing Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates, and, after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, then they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article 2. 

  

 (e) _Investment of Merger Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Merger Fund as directed by Parent, provided that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Section 2.1(a). 

  

 (f) _Termination of Merger Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate with regard to Per Share Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may require as indemnity against any claim that may be

   ##### 

  

   

 made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
distribute such Per Share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement. 

  

 (h) _Withholding_. Parent or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as Parent or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Treasury Regulations_ ") or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Paying Agent. 

  

 SECTION 2.3 _APPRAISAL RIGHTS_. The Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who neither shall have voted in favor of the Merger nor shall have consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with the DGCL are referred to herein as " _Dissenting Shares_ ". Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into a right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, and instead shall be entitled only to such rights as are provided under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, such Shares shall no longer be deemed to be Dissenting Shares and shall be treated as if they had been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of such Shares. Except as required by applicable law or with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. 

  

 SECTION 2.4 _ADJUSTMENTS_. In the event that prior to the Effective Time, there shall have been declared or effected a stock split, subdivision, reverse stock split, consolidation and division, stock dividend or stock distribution (including any dividend, or distribution, of securities convertible into Shares), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or similar event made with respect to the Shares, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of such event. 

  

 SECTION 2.5 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON EQUITY AWARDS_. 

  

 (a) _Stock Options_. The board of directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as shall be required to cause each Stock Option (as defined in Section 3.3) to terminate and be cancelled at the Effective Time, with each holder of a Stock Option entitled to receive from Parent at the Effective Time a Cash Amount in settlement of such Stock Option. The " _Cash Amount_ " shall be equal to the net amount of (i) the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Stock Option, multiplied by (B) the number of shares subject to such Stock Option, less (ii) any applicable withholdings for Taxes. If the exercise price per share of any Stock Option equals or exceeds the Per Share Merger Consideration, the Cash Amount therefor shall be $0.01 per share. Payment of the Cash Amount shall be communicated to each 

   ##### 

  

    

holder of Stock Options in a written notice from the Company that has been
approved by Parent stating that, upon acceptance of the Cash Amount, such
holder understands that no further payment is due to such holder on account
of any Stock Options and all of such holders rights under such Stock Options
have terminated. All amounts payable to a holder of an outstanding Stock
Option shall be rounded to the nearest cent. 

  

 (b) _Restricted Stock_. The Board of Directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as shall be required to cause all restrictions on the then-outstanding shares of Restricted Stock (as defined in Section 3.3) to lapse immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each holder of Restricted Stock shall be treated as a holder of Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) _Cancellation_. As of the Effective Time, except as provided in this Section 2.5, all rights under any Stock Options and any provision of the Companys stock option plans providing for the issuance and grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company shall be cancelled. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that, as of and after the Effective Time, except as provided in this Section 2.5, no Person shall have any rights with respect to securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof. 

  

 (d) _Section 16 Exemption_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.5 and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is subject to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. 

  

ARTICLE 3 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

   

 Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Parent concurrently with the execution hereof (the " _Disclosure Letter_ ") or except for events or facts disclosed with reasonable specificity in the Company Reports (as defined in Section 3.7(a)) furnished or filed with the SEC on or after January 1, 2006 and prior to the date hereof, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that: 

  

 SECTION 3.1 _EXISTENCE; GOOD STANDING; CORPORATE AUTHORITY_. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is duly qualified to transact business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.9). The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The copies of the Companys restated certificate 

   ##### 

  

   

 of incorporation and bylaws previously made available to Parent are true and
correct and contain all amendments as of the date hereof.

  

 SECTION 3.2 _AUTHORIZATION, VALIDITY AND EFFECT OF AGREEMENTS_. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and all other agreements and documents contemplated hereby to which it is a party. The consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action, other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders. This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or limiting creditors rights generally and general principles of equity.

Parent will not, and will cause its representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.5 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 SECTION 5.6 _PUBLICITY_. The Company and Parent will consult with each other and will mutually agree upon any press releases or public announcements pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press releases or make any such public announcements prior to such consultation and agreement, except as may be required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such press releases or making any such public announcements.

 SECTION 5.8 _INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law each person who is immediately prior to the Effective Time, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company and each person who immediately prior to the Effective Time is serving or prior to the Effective Time has served at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise, including the members of the Administrative Committee of the Company Plans (individually, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their capacities as such, whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (an " _Action_ "), (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay, as incurred, the fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, in advance of the final disposition of any such Action to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and, if required, upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law, and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided, however, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without their written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and provided further that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 5.8(a) to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any single Action, unless, in the good faith judgment of any of the Indemnified Parties, there is or may be a conflict of interests between two or more of such Indemnified Parties, in which case there may be separate counsel for each similarly situated group. In no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to indemnify any of the Indemnified Parties or advance any expenses on behalf of any of the Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Section 5.8 to any greater extent than the Company, as applicable, would have been required to so indemnify or advance expenses pursuant to the restated 

   ##### 

  

 

certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or
contractual indemnification agreements binding on the Company (including
board resolutions relating to the Administrative Committee of the Company
Plans) which such contractual indemnification agreements and board
resolutions are disclosed on Schedule 5.8(a) of the Disclosure Letter, each as
in existence on the date hereof. 

   

 (b) The parties agree that the rights to indemnification hereunder, including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of any action or suit, in the restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and any board resolutions relating to the Administrative Committee of the Company Plans and indemnification agreement of the Company with respect to matters occurring through the Effective Time, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any Action pending or asserted or claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. 

  

 (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain or cause to be maintained officers and directors liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") covering the Indemnified Parties who are or at any time prior to the Effective Time were covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance policies on terms substantially no less advantageous to such Indemnified Parties than such existing DandO Insurance with respect to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, prior to the Effective Time (whether claims, actions or other proceedings relating thereto are commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time); provided, however, that, after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 200% of the 2006 annual premium paid by the Company (the amount of which premium is set forth in Schedule 5.8(c) of the Disclosure Letter) (the " _the Company Maximum Premium_ "), but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. The Company shall have the right, subject to the consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, to cause coverage to be extended under the Companys DandO Insurance policy by obtaining a six- year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the Companys existing DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this Section 5.8 with respect to Indemnified Parties who are or at any time prior to the Effective Time were covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance. 

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and are expressly intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i) is consolidated with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity in such consolidation or merger and the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.8 do not become the obligations of the successor under operation of law or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any Person, then and in either such case, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall expressly assume in writing the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 5.8 that still survive. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 5.9 _EMPLOYEE BENEFITS_.

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.9(a):

 (ii) Parent agrees that if the Closing has not occurred, the Company may make routine grants of Restricted Stock in December 2006; provided, however, that the terms of such grants of Restricted Stock shall provide that the entire amount of such grants will be forfeited immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (iii) Parent covenants and agrees that for a period of at least one year following the Effective Time, the benefits taken as a whole offered under the Surviving Corporations and/or the Parents benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements to Employees will be no less favorable, taken as a whole, to such Employees than the benefits offered under the Company Plans as of the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Employees shall be given credit for years of service with the Company under all applicable plans, programs, policies and arrangements of Parent, there shall be no gaps or lapses of coverage for Employees under group health plans, and Parent shall cause (A) such Employees and their eligible dependents who are participating in the Company group health plan as of the Effective Time to be credited under Parents group health plans for the year during which such coverage under such group health plans begins, with any deductibles and copayments already incurred during such year under the group health plans of the Company, and (B) Parents group health plan to waive any preexisting condition restrictions to the extent necessary to provide immediate coverage to the extent such preexisting condition restrictions have been waived, or would have been waived, under the Companys group health plans or as otherwise required by applicable law. 

   

 (iv) Parent agrees to implement a severance plan on the terms set forth in Schedule 5.9(b)(iv) of the Disclosure Letter with respect to any Employee whose employment is terminated without cause within one year following the Effective Time. 

   

 (v) Parent agrees that (A) bonuses will continue to accrue under the Companys existing 2006 Management Discretionary Bonus Plan through the Effective Time, shall be allocated to Employees by the Companys board of directors and senior officers in accordance with such plan, and shall be paid by the Company promptly after the allocation is 

    ##### 

  

    

made, and (B) the Company may establish a bonus pool, which shall be
allocated and paid at the Effective Time to Employees as the Companys board
of directors shall determine in its sole discretion, provided, however, that
the aggregate amount of bonuses paid under the plans described in clauses (A)
and (B) shall not in the aggregate exceed $13,000,000. 

   

 (vi) To the extent not made by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make (A) the allocations due up to the Effective Time under the Giant Industries, Inc. and Affiliated Companies Deferred Compensation Plan, and set aside corresponding amounts in the grantor trust associated therewith, and (B) any mandatory matching and 3% supplemental contributions due up to the Effective Time under the Giant Industries, Inc. and Affiliated Companies 401(k) Plan, in each case as set forth in Schedule 5.9(b)(vi) of the Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (c) In addition to the foregoing: 

  

 (i) Parent shall pay or reimburse the Employees who have employment agreements with the Company as of the date of this Agreement for any excise taxes imposed on compensation payable to them as a result of the Merger as set forth in Schedule 5.9(c)(i) of the Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (ii) Parent agrees to continue in effect the retiree medical coverage described in Schedule 5.9(c)(ii) or provide equivalent coverage, subject to the limitations described in Schedule 5.9(c)(ii). 

   

 (d) Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall be construed as a contract of employment, and this Section 5.9 shall not give any employee the right to be retained in the employ of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as provided in Section 5.9(b) and Section 5.9(c), nothing in this Section 5.9 shall be construed to require the provision of coverage or benefits to an Employee except to the extent such coverage or benefits is otherwise required pursuant to applicable law, the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement or any employment agreement or employment offer letter. 

  

 (e) Except for the rights conferred pursuant to Section 5.9(c), nothing herein shall be construed to cause the Employees to be third party beneficiaries with respect to the provisions of this Section 5.9 or have any rights to enforce such provisions against the parties. 

  

 SECTION 5.10 _TAX MATTERS_. 

  

 (a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall duly and timely file all Tax Returns that it is required to file and shall pay all unpaid Taxes shown on such Tax Returns, subject to timely extensions permitted by law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such extensions.

 SECTION 5.12 _409A COMPLIANCE_. Parent agrees that prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to amend the Company Plans impacted by Code Section 409A to the extent necessary to preserve the intended benefits and avoid adverse tax consequences under Code Section 409A to the participants; provided, however, that no amendment shall be made that could reasonably be expected to result in an increase in cost to, or liability of, the Company except for the time value of money if payment of benefits is required to be accelerated. Parent further agrees that, to the extent that additional amendments may be necessary after the Effective Time to preserve the intended benefits and avoid adverse tax consequences under Code Section 409A to the participants, Parent shall cause such amendments to be made, provided that no such amendment shall be made that could reasonably be expected to result in an increase in cost to, or liability of, the Parent or the Surviving Corporation except for the time value of money if payment of benefits is required to be accelerated. 

  

 SECTION 5.13 _DEBT TENDER OFFER_. (a) In the event and at such time as requested by Parent (provided that Parent shall coordinate with the Company regarding such timing), the Company shall (i) commence a cash tender offer to purchase all of the Companys outstanding 11% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 (the " _11% Notes_ ") and the Companys outstanding 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the " _8% Notes_ ", and together with the 11% Notes, the " _Senior Subordinated Notes_ "), or either the 11% Notes or 8% Notes, as requested by Parent, and (ii) solicit the consent of the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes (or the 8% Notes or 11% Notes, as requested by Parent), regarding the amendments (the " _Indenture Amendments_ ") described on Schedule 5.13 hereto to the covenants contained in the indentures to which the Senior Subordinated Notes (or the 8% Notes or 11% Notes, as applicable) are subject. Any such offer to purchase and consent solicitation (the " _Debt Offer_ ") shall be made on such terms and conditions as are described on Schedule 5.13 and such other terms and conditions agreed to by Parent; provided, that, in any event, the parties agree that the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer shall provide that the closing thereof shall be contingent upon the closing of the Merger. The Company shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt Offer and make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer as may be reasonably requested by Parent, and the Company shall not, without Parents prior consent, waive any condition to the Debt Offer described on Schedule 5.13, or make any changes to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer. The Company covenants and agrees that, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including but not limited to the terms and conditions to the Debt Offer, it will accept for payment, and pay for, the Senior Subordinated Notes (or the 8% Notes or 11% Notes, as applicable) and effect the Indenture Amendments, in each case contemporaneously with, and contingent upon, the Effective Time. The Company shall enter into a customary dealer manager agreement and a customary information agent agreement with a dealer manager and information agent, respectively, recommended by Parent (and reasonably acceptable to the Company) on terms acceptable to Parent. Parent shall pay directly to the dealer manager and the information agent all compensation owed to them under their respective agreements relating to the Debt Offer, whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

  

 (b) Promptly upon the request of Parent, the Company shall prepare, subject to advice and comments of Parent, an offer to purchase the Senior Subordinated Notes (or the 8% Notes or 11% Notes, as applicable) and forms of the related letters of transmittal and summary advertisement, as well as all other information and exhibits that may be necessary or advisable in connection with the Debt Offer (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ "). In the event that this 

    ##### 

 

  

Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article 7, the Company will have
the right to amend the Offer Documents without Parents consent. All mailings
to the holders of Senior Subordinated Notes in connection with the Debt Offer
shall be subject to the prior review, comment and approval of Parent;
provided, however, that Parents comment and approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Offer Documents to be mailed to the holders of the
Senior Subordinated Notes as promptly as practicable following receipt of
the request from Parent under paragraph (a) above to do so. 

   

 (c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information should be discovered by any party hereto, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents mailed to holders of Senior Subordinated Notes (or the 8% Notes or 11% Notes, as applicable) so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by applicable law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall promptly be prepared by the Company and, if required, filed by the Company with the SEC or disseminated by the Company to the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes (or the 8% Notes or 11% Notes, as applicable).

 SECTION 7.2 _TERMINATION BY PARENT OR THE COMPANY_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be terminated by the Company or Parent, in either case by action of its board of directors, if:

   ##### 

   

    

7.3(b) until it (i) shall have delivered to Parent written notice at least

agreement proposed to be entered into in connection with the Superior
Proposal; and (ii) shall have provided Parent with a reasonable opportunity
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
negotiate in good faith with respect thereto during such four-business day
period, so that such proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal

after consultation with nationally recognized outside legal counsel, which
may be its current outside legal counsel), in which case the Company shall no
longer have the right to terminate under this Section 7.3(b) with respect to

transfer in same day funds to an account designated by Parent.

 (a) If this Agreement is terminated: 

  

       | (i)  |   | by the Company pursuant to Section 7.3(b); or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | by Parent pursuant to Section 7.4(b);  
   

  

then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Amount (as defined below)
and, in addition, reimburse Parent for all expenses incurred by Parent in
connection with this Agreement up to $1,000,000 (the " _Maximum Reimbursement
Amount_ ") prior to or upon termination of this Agreement. All payments under
this Section 7.5 shall be made in cash by wire transfer to the account
designated in Schedule 7.5 of the Disclosure Letter or such other account
designated by Parent in writing to the Company prior to the time of such
termination. The term " _Termination Amount_ " shall mean $37,500,000. The
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.5 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.5,
and, in order to obtain such payments, Parent commences a suit which results
in a judgment against the Company for the payments set forth in this Section
7.5, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
Termination Amount and the Maximum Reimbursement Amount from the date
payments were required to be made until the date of such payments at the
prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. in effect on the date such payments were
required to be made plus one percent (1%). If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to a provision that calls for a payment to be made under this
Section 7.5, it shall not be a defense to the Companys obligation to pay
hereunder that this Agreement could have been terminated under a different
provision or could have been terminated at an earlier or later time. 

  

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.2(a) and on the date of termination the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(b) have not been satisfied, or if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.3(a), the Escrow Agent shall pay the Deposit to the Company pursuant to the Escrow Agreement as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, and such termination and liquidated damages shall be the Companys sole remedy in such events. If this Agreement is terminated for any other reason, the Escrow Agent shall pay the Deposit to Parent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (c) In addition to the foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than by Parent pursuant to Section 7.4(a) and the Company has undertaken the Debt Offer at the request of Parent, then Parent shall reimburse the Company within two business days following such termination for its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Debt Offer (other than the dealer manager and information agent fees, which Parent agrees to pay directly in all circumstances), up to a maximum of $250,000.

If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.
