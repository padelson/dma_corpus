"Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant

---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | At the Effective Time, the limited liability company

prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 1.6(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as herein defined)) shall be
canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive, at
the election of the holder as provided in and subject to Sections 1.9 and

Consideration or (iii) the Per Share Mixed Consideration (together, the

distributions in accordance with Section 1.10(e);  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (b)  |   | Each Share held in the treasury of the Company
and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (c)  |   | The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect
fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, exchange or other like
change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time (including any dividend
or distribution on the Parent Common Stock or the Company Common Stock of

 Section 1.7 _Employee Stock Options; Restricted Shares_. 

     ##### 

  

     

       | (a)  |   | At the Effective Time, each stock option to
purchase Shares granted (and not exercised, expired or terminated) pursuant
to a Company Benefit Plan providing for grants of equity-based incentive
awards or any other stock option, stock bonus, stock award, or stock purchase
plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any of the Companys
subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof or any other contract or
agreement entered into by the Company or any of the Companys subsidiaries
(collectively, "Stock Incentive Plan") that is then outstanding (in each
case, an "Option"), whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any
outstanding Option, be converted into a fully exercisable option (i) to
purchase the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (calculated on
an aggregate basis with respect to all Company Common Stock subject to a
given Option with the same terms under such Option) obtained by multiplying
the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
Option by the Exchange Ratio (with any resulting number of shares that
contain a fraction of a share being decreased to the next whole number of
shares), and (ii) at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal
to the per share Company Common Stock exercise price pursuant to such Option
divided by the Exchange Ratio (with any resulting exercise price
that contains a fraction of a cent being increased to the next whole cent),
and (iii) otherwise upon terms and conditions equivalent to such outstanding
Options. The assumption and conversion of an Option pursuant to this Section
1.7(a) shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder had or may
have to purchase Shares in respect of such Option. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall communicate the conversion in this Section 1.7(a) to
each holder of Option(s) in a written notice.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all
restrictions on each outstanding award of restricted Company Common Stock
granted by the Company pursuant to any Stock Incentive Plan that is not
subject to a price condition or other condition that has not been satisfied
prior to the date of this Agreement or that has not lapsed pursuant to the
terms of an employment agreement and specifically excluding the 2008 Long-
Term Performance-Based Restricted Stock Program (the "Restricted Shares")
shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, the Company or
Parent, lapse at that time, and each such Restricted Share shall become fully
vested in each holder thereof at that time, and each such Restricted Share
will be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and have the same rights
and be subject to the same conditions as, each share of Company Common Stock
not subject to any restrictions, except that upon vesting the holder may
satisfy the applicable withholding Tax obligations by payment by cash
or check or by returning to the Surviving Company a sufficient number of
shares of Company Common Stock equal in value to that obligation. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board of Directors and the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors shall take any
actions necessary under the Companys Stock Incentive Plans, the award
agreements thereunder and otherwise to effectuate this Section 1.7(b).  
      
    | (c)  |   | Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all
restrictions on 40% of each award relating to the 1,196,218 shares of
restricted Company Common Stock granted by the Company pursuant to the 2008
Long-Term Performance-Based Restricted  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | Stock Program, that are subject to a price condition
that has not been satisfied prior to the date of this Agreement shall,
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, the Company or Parent,
lapse at that time, and shall become fully vested in the holder thereof at
that time, and each such share will be treated at the Effective Time the same
as, and have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions as, each
share of Company Common Stock not subject to any restrictions, except that
upon vesting the holder may satisfy the applicable withholding
Tax obligations by payment by cash or check or by returning to the Surviving
Company a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock equal in value
to that obligation. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company
Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee of the Company Board of
Directors shall take any actions necessary under the Companys Stock
Incentive Plans, the award agreements thereunder and otherwise to effectuate
this Section 1.7(c). For the avoidance of doubt, all other shares of
restricted Company Common Stock granted by the Company pursuant to the 2008
Long-Term Performance-Based Restricted Stock Program shall be cancelled.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 Section 1.8 _Dissenting Shares_. 

   

       | (a)  |   | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no Share, the holder of which shall not have voted in favor of or
consented in writing to this Agreement and shall have properly complied with
the provisions of Section 262 of the Delaware Law as to appraisal rights (a
"Dissenting Share"), shall be deemed converted into and to represent the
right to receive Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.10 or any dividends
or distributions pursuant to Section 1.10(e); and the holders of Dissenting
Shares, if any, shall be entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as
are granted by Section 262 of the Delaware Law; _provided, however_ , that if
any holder of Dissenting Shares shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the
Delaware Law or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the Delaware
Law, then such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit
such rights as are granted by Section 262 and each such Dissenting Share
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 1.10, of the
Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal of any Company Common Stock and the opportunity
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under the Delaware Law. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal of the Company Common Stock, offer to settle or
settle any such demands. Any amount payable to any holder of Dissenting
Shares exercising appraisal rights shall be paid in accordance with the
Delaware Law solely by the Surviving Company from its own funds.  
   

  

 Section 1.9 _Election Procedures; Allocation of Merger Consideration_. 

      ##### 

  

     

       | (a)  |   | An election form and other appropriate and
customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates theretofore
representing shares of the Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth therein) in such form
as Parent shall specify and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the "Election Form") and pursuant to which each holder of record of shares
of the Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the Election Form
Record Date may make an election pursuant to this Section 1.9, shall be
mailed at the same time as the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or at such other
time as the Company and Parent may agree (the date on which such mailing is
commenced or such other agreed date, the "Mailing Date") to each holder of
record of the Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the record
date for notice of the Company Stockholders Meeting (the "Election Form
Record Date").  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the
beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and
instructions), other than any holder of Dissenting Shares, to specify (i) the
number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which
such holder elects to receive the Per Share Mixed Consideration ("Mixed
Consideration Election Shares"), (ii) the number of shares of such holders
Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive Per
Share Stock Consideration ("Stock Election Shares"), (iii) the number of
shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such
holder elects to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration ("Cash Election
Shares"), or (iv) that such holder makes no election with respect to such
holders Company Common Stock ("Non-Election Shares"). Any Company Common
Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective,
properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New York time, on
the 33rd day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as the
Company and Parent shall agree) (the "Election Deadline") (other than any
shares of the Company Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares as of
such time) shall also be deemed to be Non-Election Shares. Parent and the
Company may agree to extend such deadline to such other date as is agreed to
by Parent and the Company, and the Company and Parent shall make a public
announcement of such new Election Deadline, if any.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms
as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons who become
holders (or beneficial owners) of the Company Common Stock between the
Election Form Record Date and the close of business on the business day prior
to the Election Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent
all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.  
      
    | (d)  |   | Any such election shall have been properly made only if
the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election
Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly
completed only if accompanied by (i) one or more Certificates (or customary
affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such
Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing
all certificated shares of  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | the Company Common Stock covered by such Election Form
or (ii) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, any additional documents specified
by the procedures set forth in the Election Form, together with duly executed
transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form prior to the
Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the
Election Deadline, the shares of the Company Common Stock represented by such
Election Form shall become Non-Election Shares and Parent shall cause the
Certificates, if any, representing the Company Common Stock to be
promptly returned without charge to the person submitting the Election Form
upon written request to that effect from the holder who submitted the
Election Form, except to the extent (if any) a subsequent election is
properly made with respect to any or all of the applicable shares of the
Company Common Stock. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the
Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and
any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall
be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent
shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an
Election Form.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (e)  |   | Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to allocate
among the holders of the Company Common Stock with rights to receive Merger
Consideration in accordance with the Election Form as follows:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | _Mixed Consideration_. Each Mixed Consideration
Election Share and each Non-Election Share shall be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Mixed Consideration.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | _Cash Election Shares for more than Total Cash
Amount_. If the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash
Election Shares by (y) the Per Share Cash Consideration is greater than the
Total Cash Amount less the aggregate cash paid to holders of Mixed
Consideration Election Shares and Non-Election Shares, then:  
   

  

       | (A)  |   | All Stock Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration,  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | The Exchange Agent shall then select from among the
Cash Election Shares, pro rata to the holders of Cash Election Shares in
accordance with their respective numbers of Cash Election Shares (except as
provided in the last paragraph of this Section 1.9(e)), a sufficient number
of shares ("Stock Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount
that will be paid in the Merger equals as closely as practicable the Total
Cash Amount, and all Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and  
      
    | (C)  |   | The Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated
Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration.  
     

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (iii)  |   | _Cash Election Shares for less than Total Cash
Amount_. If the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash
Election Shares by (y) the Per Share Cash Consideration is less than the
Total Cash Amount less the aggregate cash paid to holders of Mixed
Consideration Election Shares and Non-Election Shares, then:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (A)  |   | All Cash Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration,  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | The Exchange Agent shall then select from among the
Stock Election Shares, in each case pro rata to the holders of Stock Election
Shares in accordance with their respective numbers of Stock Election Shares,
as the case may be, a sufficient number of shares ("Cash Designated Shares")
such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger equals as
closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount, and all Cash Designated Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration, and  
      
    | (C)  |   | The Stock Election Shares that are not Cash Designated
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration.  
   

  

       | (iv)  |   | _Cash Election Shares equal to Total Cash
Amount_. If the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash
Election Shares by (y) the Per Share Cash Consideration is equal to the Total
Cash Amount less the aggregate cash paid to holders of Mixed Consideration
Election Shares and Non-Election Shares, then subparagraphs (ii) and (iii)
above shall not apply and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and all Stock Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the fullest
extent permitted by Delaware Law, for purposes of determining the allocations
set forth in this Section 1.9, Parent shall have the right to require, but
not the obligation to require (unless such requirement is necessary to
satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(e) or Section 6.3(d)), that
any shares of the Company Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares as
of the Election Deadline be treated as Cash Election Shares not subject to
the pro rata selection process contemplated by this Section 1.9. 

   

       | (f)  |   | The pro rata selection process to be used by the
Exchange Agent shall consist of such equitable pro ration processes as shall
be reasonably and mutually determined by Parent and the Company.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 Section 1.10 _Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_. 

   

       | (a)  |   | Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. to act as agent (the "Exchange Agent") for
the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger to receive the Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 1.6(a). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the
benefit of the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock, (a) the shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6 and delivered
pursuant to this Section 1.10 and (b) cash or immediately available funds
equal to the Total Cash Amount, plus the additional cash amounts estimated to
be payable pursuant to Sections 1.10(e) and 1.10(f) below. Such shares of
Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto (as provided in Section 1.10(e)) and such funds, are referred
to herein as the "Exchange Fund." The Exchange Agent, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions consistent with the terms of this Agreement, shall deliver the
Parent Common Stock and the cash portion of the aggregate Merger
Consideration to be issued or paid pursuant to Section 1.6 out of the
Exchange Fund, and the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose
whatsoever. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any
rights of ownership with respect to the Parent Common Stock held by it from
time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends
or other distributions paid or distributed after the deposit of such Exchange
Fund with respect thereto for the account of persons entitled thereto. Such
funds in the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as
directed by the Surviving Company, _provided, however,_ that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or of any agency thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of
the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or
bankers acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or
Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks with capital,
surplus and undivided profits aggregating in excess of $100 million (based on
the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly
available at the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") or otherwise);
_provided, however_ , that no loss on any investment made pursuant to
this Section 1.10 shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the
holders of Shares, and following any losses, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of
the Company in the amount of any such losses.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (b)  |   | Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to mail to each person who was, at the Effective
Time, a holder of record of (i) an outstanding certificate or certificates
("Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
such holders Shares or (ii) Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry
Shares") a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth
therein, which shall be in customary form and agreed to by Parent and the
Company prior to the Effective Time) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the
surrender of such shares, in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent
of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required pursuant to such instructions, (A) the holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares shall be  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | entitled to receive in exchange therefor a book-entry
statement or a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, if any, and cash portion of the Merger Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 1.10(f), and
any unpaid dividends and distributions that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.10(e) (after giving effect to any required
withholding of taxes); and (B) such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall
then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered
on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
payment shall have paid all transfer and other taxes required by reason of
the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Company that such taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.
The Surviving Company shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Exchange Agent, in connection with the distribution of the Merger
Consideration.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (c)  |   | At any time following one year after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds and shares of Parent Common Stock
in the Exchange Fund which had been made available to the Exchange Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Shares (including, without limitation, all
interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all
funds made available to it) and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled
to look to the Surviving Company and Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with
respect to any Merger Consideration (along with cash in lieu of fractional
shares or unpaid dividends and distributions, if any that may be payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them).  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (d)  |   | From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
law.  
      
    | (e)  |   | No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock declared or made after the Effective Time with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable law: (i) at
the time of the surrender of a Certificate for exchange in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 1.10, there shall be paid to the surrendering
holder, without interest, the amount of dividends or other
distributions (having a record date after the Effective Time but on or prior
to surrender and a payment date on or prior to surrender) not theretofore
paid with respect to the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that
such holder is entitled to receive (less the amount of any withholding taxes
that may be  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | required with respect thereto); and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date and without duplicating any payment made under
clause (i) above, there shall be paid to the surrendering holder, without
interest, the amount of dividends or other distributions (having a record
date after the Effective Time but on or prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to surrender) payable with respect to the number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock that such holder receives (less the amount of any
withholding taxes that may be required with respect thereto).  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (f)  |   | No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger and, except as
provided in this Section 1.10(f), no dividend or other distribution, stock
split or interest shall relate to any such fractional share, and such
fractional share shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock to which a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise
be entitled (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by or on behalf of such holder), such holder, upon surrender of a
Certificate as described in this Section 1.10, shall be paid an amount in
cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the per
share closing sales prices of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE, as reported in
The Wall Street Journal, for the five consecutive trading days ending on the
calendar day immediately prior to the Closing Date (or if such calendar day
is not a trading day, then ending on the first trading day immediately
preceding such calendar day) by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder would in addition otherwise be entitled, in
which case Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, the amount of
cash necessary to make such payments together with any other cash being
provided to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.10(a). The Parties
acknowledge that payment of cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock was not separately bargained for consideration
but represents merely a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying
the problems that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (g)  |   | In the event any certificates of Company Common Stock
are lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue and pay to such
holder the Merger Consideration required pursuant to this Section 1.10 in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit, which shall include indemnities and the posting of a bond that
are reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the holder thereof with
such assurances as the Exchange Agent, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance and payment of the Merger Consideration, as the
case may be, may reasonably require of the holder of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates.  
   

  

 Section 1.11 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of Shares (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Restricted Shares) pursuant to this Agreement any amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by 

     ##### 

  

    

Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be, and are paid over to the appropriate governmental authority in
accordance with applicable law, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be. 

   

 Section 1.12 _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article I, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person with respect to any Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

ARTICLE II 

   

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

The Company (i) has the requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties, to operate its operated properties, and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character of the properties owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except, in the case of (i) or (ii), as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each subsidiary of the Company (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) has the requisite corporate or other business entity power and authority to own or lease its properties, to operate its operated properties, and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and (iii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character of the properties owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, in each case, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. When used in connection with the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any effect, event or change that is materially adverse to the business, assets, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or that prevents or materially impedes or delays the ability of the Company to perform in all material respects its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except, in each case, for any such effect, event or change (i) to the extent resulting from changes in the financial or securities markets or general economic or political conditions in the United States or elsewhere in the world, (ii) to the extent resulting from changes or conditions generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and/or production industry or industries (including changes in oil, gas or other commodity prices), (iii) to the extent resulting from any change in applicable law or the interpretation thereof or GAAP or the interpretation thereof, (iv) to the extent resulting from the negotiation, execution, announcement or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the loss or departure of officers or other 

     ##### 

  

    

employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any adverse change in
customer, distributor, supplier or similar relationships resulting therefrom,

hurricanes, tornados or other natural disasters, (vi) to the extent resulting
from any failure by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to meet
any internal or published industry analyst projections or forecasts or
estimates of revenues or earnings for any period (it being understood and
agreed that the facts and circumstances that may have given rise or
contributed to such failure that are not otherwise excluded from the
definition of a Company Material Adverse Effect may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been a Company Material Adverse Effect), (vii)
to the extent resulting from any change in the price of the Company Stock on
the NYSE (it being understood and agreed that the facts and circumstances
that may have given rise or contributed to such change (but in no event
changes in the trading price of Parent Stock) that are not otherwise excluded
from the definition of a Company Material Adverse Effect may be taken into
account in determining whether there has been a Company Material Adverse
Effect), (viii) to the extent resulting from the failure to take any action as
a result of any restrictions or prohibitions set forth in Section 4.1 of this
Agreement with respect to which Parent refused, following the Companys
request, to provide a waiver in a timely manner or at all, (ix) to the extent
resulting from compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any
action required by, this Agreement, (x) to the extent resulting from the
downgrade in rating of any debt or debt securities of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries (it being understood and agreed that the facts and
circumstances that may have given rise or contributed to such downgrade that
are not otherwise excluded from the definition of a Company Material Adverse
Effect may be taken into account in determining whether there has been a
Company Material Adverse Effect) and (xi) to the extent resulting from any
legal proceedings arising out of or related to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent such effects in the
cases of clauses (i), (ii), and (v) above materially and disproportionately
effect the Company and its subsidiaries relative to other participants in the
industry or industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate (in
which event the extent of such material and disproportionate effect may
be taken into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse
Effect has occurred). A true and complete list of all of the Companys
subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization
of each such subsidiary and the percentage of the outstanding capital stock
of each such subsidiary owned by the Company and each other Company
subsidiary, is set forth in Section 2.1 of the Company Schedule. Other than
with respect to the Company subsidiaries set forth on Section 2.1 of the
Company Schedule, the Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity
interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for, any equity interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or
other business entity. The term "Company Material Subsidiaries" means each
Company subsidiary designated as such on Section 2.1 of the Company Schedule.
The Company Material Subsidiaries are the only Company subsidiaries
that constitute "significant subsidiaries" within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of
Regulation S-X. 

   

 Section 2.2 _Charter and Bylaws_. The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent a true and complete copy of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended to date. Such certificate of incorporation and bylaws are in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement.

The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 180,000,000 Shares and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share (the "Company Preferred Stock"). As of April 14, 2010, (i) 103,241,493 Shares were issued and outstanding (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Shares in the form of restricted stock issued pursuant to employee benefit plans of the Company), all of which were validly issued, fully paid 

     ##### 

  

    

and nonassessable (except for any restricted stock), and none of which were
issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights of any securityholder
of the Company and (ii) Options to purchase an aggregate of 640,778 Shares
were issued and outstanding (all of which Options were exercisable). As of
the date hereof, 180,000 shares of the Company Preferred Stock have

reserved for issuance in connection with the Companys Rights Agreement dated
as October 12, 2008, as amended on the date hereof (the "Company Rights

no shares of the Company Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding. Since
March 31, 2010 to the date of this Agreement, the Company has not issued any
shares of capital stock or granted any options covering shares of capital
stock, except for Shares and associated Rights issued pursuant to
the exercise of Options or pursuant to any employee ownership or benefit
plan. Subject to the foregoing, there are no options, warrants or other
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character obligating
the Company or any Company Material Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of
capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any Company
Material Subsidiary. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the
Company or any Company Material Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any shares of capital stock of the Company or any Company Material
Subsidiary. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock or
equivalent equity interests of each Company Material Subsidiary have been
duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are
owned by the Company, directly or through its subsidiaries, free and clear of
any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance or claim (other
than in favor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries); and none of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or equivalent equity interests of the
Company Material Subsidiaries were issued in violation of any preemptive or
similar rights arising by operation of law, or under the charter, bylaws or
other comparable organizational documents of any Company Material Subsidiary
or under any agreement to which the Company or any Company Material
Subsidiary is a party.

disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively,
of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act are
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to the management of the Company

make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"). The management of the Company
has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2009,
and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. To the
knowledge of the Company, it has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluations, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the
board of directors of the Company (A) all significant deficiencies in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting and any
material weaknesses, which have more than a remote chance to materially
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) and
(B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Since January 1, 2008, to the knowledge of the Company,

subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of
its subsidiaries has a "significant deficiency" or "material weakness" (as
such terms are defined in the Public Accounting Oversight Boards Auditing
Standard No. 2, as in effect on the date hereof), in the Companys internal
controls over financial reporting.

     ##### 

  

    

Agreement, and (iii) for liabilities incurred since March 31, 2010 in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, whether known or
unknown and whether due or to become due, required by GAAP to be set forth on
a consolidated balance sheet of the Company, that would be reasonably
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. 

   

 Section 2.10 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. From January 1, 2010, until the date of this Agreement, except as contemplated by this Agreement, the Company has conducted its businesses only in the ordinary course and there has not been (i) any event having, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any change by the Company in its accounting methods, principles or practices materially affecting the consolidated assets, liabilities or results of operations of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, except insofar as may have been required by a change in GAAP or (iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or distribution in respect of any capital stock of the Company or any redemption, purchase or other acquisition for value of any of its capital stock. 

   

 Section 2.11 _Litigation_. Except with respect to Tax matters or Environmental Laws, which are addressed exclusively in Sections 2.16 and 2.17, respectively, there is no action, suit, claim, proceeding or governmental investigation, either at law or in equity, before or by any court or governmental authority now pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company or any of its subsidiaries that would be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 Section 3.8 _Internal Controls and Procedures._  

  

       | (a)  |   | Parent has established and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as
such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange
Act. Parents disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to
ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Parent in
the reports that it files under the Exchange Act are recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the management of Parent as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. The management of Parent has completed its assessment of
the effectiveness of Parents internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2009, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. To the knowledge of Parent, it has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluations, to Parents outside auditors and the audit
committee of the board of directors of Parent (A) all significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting and any material weaknesses, which have more than a remote
chance to materially adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal controls over financial reporting.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Since January 1, 2009, to the knowledge of Parent,
neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries nor any director, officer,

subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of Parent or any of its subsidiaries, including any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of its
subsidiaries has a "significant deficiency" or "material weakness" (as
such terms are defined in the Public Accounting Oversight Boards Auditing
Standard No. 2, as in effect on the date hereof), in Parents internal
controls over financial reporting.

Parent has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not

sheet of Parent, that would be reasonably expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 Section 3.11 _Litigation_. Except with respect to employee benefit or Tax matters or Environmental Laws, which are addressed exclusively in Sections 3.12, 3.16 and 3.17, respectively, there is no action, suit, claim, proceeding or governmental investigation, either at law or in equity, before or by any court or governmental authority now pending, or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent or any of its subsidiaries that would be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_  

  

 Section 5.1 _Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_. 

   

       | (a)  |   | Parent and the Company shall cooperate and
promptly prepare the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and shall file the Registration Statement in which the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus with the SEC as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof and in any event not
later than 45 days after the date hereof. Parent and the Company shall
cooperate to promptly respond to any comments made by the SEC and otherwise
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
filing. Parent and the Company will provide each other with any information
which may be required to prepare and file the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
the Registration Statement hereunder. The Company will cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its stockholders at the
earliest practicable time after the Registration Statement is declared
effective by the SEC. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event
occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, Parent or the
Company, as applicable, will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and
cooperate in filing such amendment or supplement with the SEC, use reasonable
best efforts to cause such amendment to become effective as promptly as
possible and, if required, mail same to the stockholders of the Company.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Parent will cause the Registration Statement (and
Parent and the Company will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, each to the
extent such Party provides information to be contained therein), at the time
it becomes effective under the Securities Act, to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and the
Company shall be responsible for furnishing to Parent materially true,
accurate and complete information relating to the Company and holders of the
Company Common Stock and Options as is required to be included therein.
Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof,
of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective under the
Securities Act, the issuance of any stop order with respect to the
Registration Statement, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any comments or requests for additional information by
the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Each of Parent and the Company shall ensure that the
information provided by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and each amendment or supplement thereto, at the time of mailing thereof and
at the time of the meeting   
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | of stockholders of the Company, or, in the case of
information provided by it for inclusion in the Registration Statement or any
amendment or supplement thereto, at the time it becomes effective, will not
include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (d)  |   | Neither the Registration Statement nor the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus nor any amendment or supplement (including by
incorporation by reference) thereto will be filed or disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company without the approval of both Parent and the
Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned; provided that, with respect to documents filed by a party
hereto that are incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, this right of approval shall apply only with
respect to information relating to the other party or its business, financial
condition or results of operations; and provided, further, that the Company,
in connection with a Change in the Company Recommendation, may amend or
supplement the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Registration Statement
(including by incorporation by reference) to effect such a Change in
the Company Recommendation, and in such event, this right of approval shall
apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or its
business, financial condition or results of operations.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | The Company, acting through the Company Board of
Directors, shall, in accordance with applicable law and the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold an annual or special meeting of its stockholders (the "Stockholders
Meeting") as soon as reasonably practicable following execution of this
Agreement for the purpose of adopting by requisite vote this Agreement (the
"Company Stockholder Approval"). The Company Board of Directors
shall, subject to Section 5.3(b), recommend the adoption of this Agreement at
the Stockholders Meeting (the "Company Recommendation"), include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 7.1 and subject to compliance with Section 5.3, the Company,
regardless of whether the Company Board of Directors has approved, endorsed
or recommended an Alternative Proposal or has withdrawn, modified or amended
the Recommendation, will submit this Agreement for approval by the
stockholders of the Company at such meeting.  
      
    | (f)  |   | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders
Meeting to the extent it believes in good faith is necessary to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
other disclosure is provided to the Companys stockholders to satisfy the
law, including the duty of disclosure, or, if as of the time for which the
Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of the Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct business at such meeting, or to solicit
additional proxies in favor of the Agreement.

 Section 5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

   

       | (a)  |   | To the extent not restricted by third party
agreement or applicable law, the Company shall, subject to any necessary
third-party approvals, allow the Parent and its officers, employees,
representatives, consultants, attorneys, agents, lenders, bankers, financial
advisors and other advisors reasonable access during normal business
hours, at such partys sole risk and expense, to all facilities, properties,
personnel, books and records of the Company and its subsidiaries. Parent
agrees to conduct its investigation in a manner that does not interfere
unreasonably with the Companys or its subsidiaries operations and with the
prompt and timely discharge by such partys employees of their duties. Parent
agrees to indemnify and hold the Company and its subsidiaries harmless from
any and all claims and liabilities, including costs and expenses for loss,
injury to or death of any representative of the Parent Parties, and any loss,
damage to or destruction of any property owned by the Company or
the subsidiaries or others (including claims or liabilities for loss of use
of any property) resulting directly or indirectly from the action or inaction
of any of the Parent Parties representatives during any visit to the
business or property sites of the Company or the subsidiaries prior to the
completion of the Merger, whether pursuant to this Section 5.2 or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide
access to or otherwise disclose information if such information is subject
to, or such access or disclosure would jeopardize, the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege
concerning legal proceedings or governmental investigations; provided that
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the
required consent of such Third Party to provide such access or disclosure,
(B) develop an alternative to providing such information so as to address
such matters that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company or (C)
enter into a joint defense agreement or implement such other techniques if
the parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of
such information without violating applicable law or jeopardizing
such privilege. None of the Parent Parties nor any of their officers,
employees, representatives, consultants, attorneys, agents, lenders, bankers,
financial advisors or other advisors shall conduct any environmental testing
or sampling on any of the business or property sites of the Company or its
subsidiaries prior to the completion of the Merger without the prior written
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Any information obtained by the Parent Parties or the
Company or their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives,
consultants, attorneys, agents, lenders, bankers, financial advisors and
other advisors under this Section 5.2 shall be subject to the confidentiality
and use restrictions contained in that certain letter agreement between the
Company and Parent dated March 26, 2010 (the "Confidentiality Agreement").  
   

  

 Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_. 

   

       | (a)  |   | The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its
subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its subsidiaries
shall, and that it shall cause its and  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | such subsidiaries employees, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its subsidiaries), not to directly or indirectly,
(i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to, or a transaction to effect, a
merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company or
any Company subsidiary, or any purchase or sale of 20% or more of the
consolidated assets (including stock of its subsidiaries) of the Company and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any purchase or sale of, or tender or
exchange offer for, its equity securities that, if consummated, would result
in any person (or the stockholders of such person) beneficially owning
securities representing 20% or more of the Companys total voting power (or
of the surviving parent entity in such transaction) (any such inquiry,
proposal, offer or transaction, an "Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) have
any discussion with or provide or cause to be provided any non-public
information to any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or engage or
participate in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve, endorse or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, or execute or enter into,
any letter of intent, option agreement, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement or agree to do
any of the foregoing related to any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of this Section 5.3 by any
subsidiary of the Company or representatives of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3 by the
Company.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (b)  |   | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or
its Board of Directors may (i) engage or participate in negotiations or
discussions with, or provide or cause to be provided any information to, any
person in response to, or otherwise facilitate, an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of clause (a) above if (A)
the Companys Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its outside counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal
(as defined below) and (B) prior to providing any non-public information to
any person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by any such person, the
Company receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement
having provisions that are no less restrictive than those of the
Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that the Company may enter into
a confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision or with a
standstill provision less favorable to the Company if it waives or similarly
modifies the standstill provision in the Confidentiality Agreement);
_provided_ that the Company shall promptly provide or make available to
Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company or any of
its subsidiaries that is provided to the person making such Alternative
Proposal or such persons representatives which was not previously
provided or made available to Parent or its representatives, (ii) fail to
make, withdraw, modify or qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or
qualify) the Company Recommendation or approve or recommend (or
publicly propose to approve or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal or letter
of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement
providing for any Acquisition Proposal (a "Change in the Company
Recommendation") if   
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | (A) the Company Board of Directors concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors,
that a Change in the Company Recommendation is necessary in order to comply
with its fiduciary obligations or (B) the Company has received an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal and its Board of Directors concludes in good faith that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and its Board of
Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisors, that a Change in the Company
Recommendation is necessary in order to comply with its fiduciary
obligations; _provided, however,_  that no Change in the Company
Recommendation may be made until (x) the third business day following
Parents receipt of written notice (a "Notice of Intended Change in the
Company Recommendation") from the Company advising Parent that the Company
Board of Directors intends to make a Change in the Company Recommendation and
specifying the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal, if
any, that is related to such Change in the Company Recommendation and the
identity of the party making such proposal (it being understood and agreed
that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of any
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Intended Change in the
Company Recommendation and a new three business day period) and Parent has
not proposed, within three business days after its receipt of the Notice of
Intended Change in the Company Recommendation, such adjustment to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company Board of
Directors to proceed with the Company Recommendation or, if the intended
Change in the Company Recommendation does not relate to a Superior Proposal,
a general description of the material events giving rise thereto and (y) if
there is a Superior Proposal, the Company Board of Directors has approved
or concurrently approves a definitive agreement in respect of such proposal
and terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) and otherwise
complies with Section 7.3 and other provisions of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, disclosure by the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with
respect thereto shall not be deemed to be a Change in the Company
Recommendation. "Superior Proposal" means an Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board of Directors determines, in good faith and after consultation
with its outside counsel and financial advisors, is reasonably capable of
being completed, is, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board
of Directors, reasonably capable of being fully financed and is more
favorable to the holders of the Shares (in their capacity as stockholders)
than the transactions provided for in this Agreement, taking into account,

       | (a)  |   | The organizational documents of the Surviving
Company shall contain provisions with respect to exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses no less favorable than the provisions set forth
in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as of the date
of this Agreement to the persons covered thereby, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of individuals who at any time from and after the date of
this Agreement and to and including the Effective Time were directors,
officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, the matters contemplated by
this Agreement), unless such modification is required by law.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | From and after the Effective Time, each of the
Surviving Company and Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, indemnify, hold harmless and advance expenses to each present
and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary and agent of the Company
and each subsidiary (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, inquiries, liabilities and settlement amounts paid
in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time),
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to any action or omission in their capacity as an officer,
director, employee, fiduciary or agent (including, without limitation, any
claim arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby), whether occurring before or after the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in each
case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law (and shall pay any
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding
to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law, upon receipt from the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced of
any undertaking to repay such advances required under applicable law). In the
event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel (including local counsel) satisfactory
to them, the reasonable fees and expenses of which shall be paid by the
Surviving Company and Parent, promptly after statements therefor are received
and (ii) each of the Surviving Company and Parent shall use   
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | reasonable best efforts in the vigorous defense of any
such matter; _provided, however_ , that each of the Surviving Company and
Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned); and _provided further_ that each of the Surviving Company
and Parent shall not be obligated pursuant to this subsection (b) to pay the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel (plus appropriate local counsel)
for all Indemnified Parties in any single action unless there is, as
determined by counsel to the Indemnified Parties, under applicable standards
of professional conduct, a conflict or a reasonable likelihood of a conflict
on any significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified
Parties, in which case such additional counsel (including local counsel) as
may be required to avoid any such conflict or likely conflict may be retained
by the Indemnified Parties at the expense of the Surviving Company and
Parent. The Surviving Company and Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses,
including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.4.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (c)  |   | Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
purchase, and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall
maintain, a fully pre-paid six-year tail policy to the current policy of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained on the date hereof by
the Company (the "Current Policy"), which tail policy shall cover a period
from the Effective Time through and including the date six years after
the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time, and which tail policy
shall contain the same coverage and amount as, and contain terms and
conditions that are equivalent to, the coverage currently provided by the
Current Policy.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (d)  |   | In the event the Surviving Company or Parent or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Company or Parent, as applicable, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.4.  
      
    | (e)  |   | In the event that the Surviving Company should fail, at
any time from and after the Effective Time, to comply with any of the
foregoing obligations set forth in this Section 5.4, for any reason, Parent
shall be responsible therefor and hereby agrees to perform such obligations
unconditionally without regard to any defense or other basis for
nonperformance which the Surviving Company may have or claim (except as would
be prohibited by applicable Delaware Law), it being the intention of this
subsection (e) that the officers, directors, employees, fiduciaries and
agents of the Company and its subsidiaries shall be fully indemnified and
that the provisions of this subsection (e) be a primary obligation of Parent
and not merely a guarantee by Parent of the obligations of the Surviving
Company.  
      
    | (f)  |   | The obligations of the Company, Parent and/or the
Surviving Company under this Section 5.4 shall not be terminated or modified

each affected director, officer,

agreed that the directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries and agents to
whom this Section 5.4 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this
Section 5.4). The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in

 (d) any occurrence or event that is reasonably likely to cause an inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of that party contained in this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be expected to cause any condition set forth in Article VI not to be satisfied.

    | (e)  |   | In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants
of the parties contained in this Section 5.6, if any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party,
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and
Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,

or adversely affect the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
should the Merger not occur.

by the relevant Company Benefit Plan if it were not a pre-existing condition.
Further, Parent shall offer and cause the Surviving Company and its other
subsidiaries to offer to each Company and subsidiary employee coverage under
a group health plan which credits such employee towards the deductibles

 Section 6.4 _Frustration of Conditions_.

ARTICLE VII 

   

 _TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_  

  

 Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company:

before January 31, 2011 (the "Outside Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Parent, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to terminate this Agreement under this clause (b)(i) if such partys
(or, in the case of Parent, Parents or Merger Subs) material breach of any
of its representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement proximately
caused the Merger not to have been consummated on or before such date; or  
---|---|---|---

governmental authority shall have issued a final, non-appealable order,

at the Company Stockholders Meeting or if adjourned or postponed, at the
final adjournment or postponement; or  
   

  

       | (c)  |   | by Parent if:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | the Company shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement
such that the

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) are
not capable of being satisfied, and such breach or failure to perform shall
not have been cured prior to the earlier of (A) 30 days following notice of
such breach or failure to the Company and (B) the Outside Date; _provided_

---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (ii)  |   | prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder

shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (A) 30 days following
notice of such breach or failure to Parent and (B) the Outside Date;

warranties or covenants in this Agreement; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company Board of Directors shall have effected a Change in the
Company Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.3(b)(ii)(B) and authorized the
Company to enter into a binding definitive agreement in respect of such
Superior Proposal;  _provided, however_ , that such termination under this
clause (d)(ii) shall not be effective until the Company has made payment to
Parent of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(a).  
   

  

 Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that the Effective Time does not occur as a result of any party hereto exercising its rights to terminate pursuant to this Article VII, then this Agreement shall be null and void and, except as provided in Sections 7.3 and 8.1 or as otherwise expressly provided herein, no party shall have any rights or obligations under this Agreement, except that no such termination shall relieve any party from liability for damages for any willful and material breach of any agreement or covenant contained herein. In the event the termination of this Agreement results from the willful and material breach of any agreement or covenant herein, then the Parent Parties or the Company, as the case may be, shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity and shall be entitled to recover court costs and reasonable attorneys fees in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.

time of such termination there shall have been publicly announced or
disclosed a bona fide Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_  that any reference

termination) and (z) within 12 months after the date of such termination, a
transaction constituting an Acquisition Proposal is consummated or the

---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (c)  |   | All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated. In no event shall Parent be
entitled to receive more than one payment of the Company Termination Fee.  
      
    | (d)  |   | Notwithstanding Section 7.1(c) above, in the event of a
termination of this Agreement pursuant to (x) Sections 7.1(c)(i), 7.1(c)(ii)
or 7.1(d)(ii) or (y) Sections 7.1(b)(i) or 7.1(b)(iii), if in the case of
this clause (y) the event of Section 7.3(b)(ii) shall also have occurred, the
Company shall reimburse Parent for up to $7.5 million in the aggregate of its
Expenses (as hereafter defined) in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds not later than two business days after delivery by Parent to
the Company of an itemization prepared in good faith setting forth
in reasonable detail all Expenses, which itemization must be delivered within

investment bankers but excluding internal costs and allocated overhead of
the Parties) incurred in connection with or related to the authorization,
preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this

following termination.

 Section 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by all parties hereto; _provided, however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment shall be made that by law requires the further approval of the Company stockholders without such further approval. 

   

 Section 7.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parent Parties, on one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, may (i) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of the Company or the Parent Parties, respectively, hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the Company or the Parent Parties, respectively, contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein applicable, respectively, to the Company or the Parent Parties.

of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be

     |   |   | followed by the words "without limitation." The words

deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any specific section.
The inclusion of any information in either the Companys or
Parents Schedules to this Agreement (as the case may be the Company Schedule
or the Parent Schedule) shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information therein, that such
information is required to be included therein or material to the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, or Parent or any of its subsidiaries, as the case
may be. The disclosure of information in the Company Schedule or the Parent
Schedule as an exception to, or for purposes of, a representation, warranty
or covenant in this Agreement shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an
exception to, or for purposes of, all other representations, warranties and
covenants herein. The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations and warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the
Company Schedule or Parent Schedule is not intended and shall not be deemed
to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or
items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the
parties to determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not
described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | b)  |   | The parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 Section 8.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
