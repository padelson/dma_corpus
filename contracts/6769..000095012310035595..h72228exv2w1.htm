reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act are recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to the management of the Company as appropriate to allow timely decisions

reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the

management of Parent as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections&nbsp;302 and 906 of

effectiveness of Parent&#146;s internal control over financial reporting in compliance with
the requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December
31, 2009, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. To the
