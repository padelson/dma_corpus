WHEREAS, the Board of Managers of Parent and the Board of Directors of Merger

WHEREAS, as consideration for the Companys willingness to enter into this
Agreement, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, (i) Guarantor

executed and delivered to the Company a limited guaranty, pursuant to
which Guarantor A and Guarantor P have agreed to guarantee certain of the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub hereunder (on the terms and conditions

\- 1 - WHEREAS, Carve-out Buyer, Parent and the Company (as the Surviving

cause the sale, to the Carve-out Buyer, and the Carve-out Buyer shall acquire
from the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, the assets and entities
comprising the SC Business (the " _Carve-out Transaction_ ").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the
parties to this Agreement hereby agree as follows: 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, as amended (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will
be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as the
surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Company as
the surviving corporation in the Merger is referred to in this Agreement as
the " _Surviving Corporation_." 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Jones Day, North Point, 901 Lakeside Avenue,
Cleveland, Ohio, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 10:00 a.m.
on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions (other than any condition that by its nature cannot be satisfied
until the Closing, but subject to satisfaction or waiver of any such
condition) set forth in _Article VIII_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than any condition that by
its nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to satisfaction
or waiver of any such condition), the Closing shall occur on the earlier
of (a) a date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent and Carve-out
Buyer on no less than three Business Days joint notice to the Company and (b)
the second Business Day immediately following the final day of the
Marketing Period (subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver of all
of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ for the Closing as of the date
that would have been the Closing Date if not for this proviso; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in no event will the extension of the Closing Date pursuant
to this proviso be deemed to create any condition to Closing in addition to
those set forth in _Article VIII_ ), or on such other date as is agreed in
writing by the parties to this Agreement. The date on which the Closing shall
occur is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_ ".

Section 1.3  _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
at the Closing, the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
executing, acknowledging and filing a certificate of merger (in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Carve-out Buyer, the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger
will become effective at the date and time of the filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such
later time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the
DGCL and as is agreed to by Parent and the Company in writing (the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 



\- 2 - Section 1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the relevant provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective
Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and
authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

Section 1.5 _Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation_. (a) At the Effective Time, the restated certificate
of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Restated Certificate of Incorporation_ ") shall be
amended and restated so as to be in substantially the form set forth on 
_Exhibit A_ attached hereto and, as so amended and restated, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by applicable Law,
subject to the obligations set forth in _Section 7.10_.

(b) At the Effective Time, the amended and restated by-laws of the Company as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _By-Laws_ ") shall
be amended and restated so as to be in substantially the form set forth on

the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with their terms, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and as provided by applicable Law, subject to the obligations set
forth in  _Section 7.10_.

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. (a) Parent,
the Company and Merger Sub shall take all requisite action, if any, to cause
the directors of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time to be, from
and after the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation and (b) the officers of the Company immediately before the
Effective Time shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each of (a) and (b), until their
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.

 

Section 1.7 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub
vested in or to be vested in the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger
Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and
do, in the name and on behalf of each such corporation or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.

 



\- 3 - ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of Shares or securities of Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to
_Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall automatically be converted into
and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $34.00 in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder of each Share
upon surrender of either certificates formerly representing such Shares ("
_Certificates_ ") or any book-entry Shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in the
manner provided in _Section 2.2_. All such Shares, when so converted, will no
longer be outstanding and will be automatically cancelled, retired and cease
to exist. Each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in consideration for such Shares upon the surrender
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.2_,
without interest. Any Merger Consideration paid in full upon the surrender of
any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
and the respective Shares formerly represented thereby.

(b) _Cancelled Shares_. Each (i) Share held in the treasury of the Company,
and (ii) Share owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, will
automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and no payment or
other consideration will be made with respect to such Shares.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and shall thereafter
represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing
the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent
the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which
they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

Section 2.2 _Payment; Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with a paying agent selected by Parent and approved by the Company
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive the funds necessary to make the payments
contemplated by _Section 2.1(a)_. At or immediately prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust with the Paying
Agent in a separate account for the benefit of holders of Shares that will be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to 
_Section 2.1(a)_ (the

 



\- 4 -  " _Payment Fund_ ") the aggregate Merger Consideration to which such holders
shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ upon due
surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu of
Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares in
compliance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 2.2_. The Paying
Agent agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall
be in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, Parent and
Carve-out Buyer.

 

(b) _Payment Procedure_. (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any event within three Business Days thereafter,
Parent shall instruct, and use reasonable best efforts to cause, the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares that were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, (A)
a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as
provided in _Section 2.2(f)_) to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal, and such letter of transmittal will be in customary form) and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(f)_)
or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares
in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares may thereafter surrender such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares to the Paying Agent under cover of the letter of transmittal, as agent
for such holder. Upon delivery of a valid letter of transmittal and the
surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as
provided in _Section 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares on or before the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay
the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in exchange for the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, cash in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares represented by such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in
_Section 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered, Certificates
(other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares, Shares held by Parent
or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or shares held in
the treasury of the Company) or Book-Entry Shares (other than Book-Entry
Shares in respect of Dissenting Shares, Shares held by Parent or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or shares held in the treasury of
the Company) will represent solely the right to receive the aggregate Merger
Consideration relating to the Shares represented by such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in  _Section 2.2(f)_)
or Book-Entry Shares.

(ii) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are registered, it will be a condition to such payment that the
Certificates, if any, so surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent and Parent that such Tax is not applicable. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ will be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
theretofore represented by such

 



\- 5 -  Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving
Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions,
in each case with a record date (A) prior to the Effective Time that may have
been declared or made by the Company on such Shares in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or (B) prior to the date of this Agreement, and in
each case which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company will be closed and there will not be any further
registration of transfers of any shares of the Companys capital stock
thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any
rights with respect to any Shares, except as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
(other than Certificates representing Shares held by Parent or any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and shares held in the treasury of
the Company) or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer they will be cancelled and exchanged
for Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article II_. No interest will
accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon the surrender of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares which immediately before the Effective Time represented the
Shares.

 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Promptly following the date that is one
year after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Payment Fund
which has not been disbursed to holders of Shares upon the due surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.2_, including
any interest or other income received with respect to the Payment Fund, and
any Certificates or other documents, in its possession relating to the
Transactions, which had been made available to the Paying Agent. Thereafter
any holder of Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ will be entitled to look to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws)
only as general creditors of the Surviving Corporation with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent will be liable
to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration
delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(e) _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under
this Agreement to any holder of Shares, and from amounts payable pursuant to
_Section 2.3_, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under
any Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Shares or other securities in respect of which such deduction and withholding
were made.

 



\- 6 - (f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, the
entry by such Person into an indemnity agreement or, at the election of
Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting of a bond in such customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the number of Shares formerly
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

 

(g) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent will invest all cash
included in the Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash will be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the United States of America in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, and, in any such case, no
such instrument will have a maturity exceeding three months, and that no
such investment or loss thereon will affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments will be paid to the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_. To the extent that there are
losses with respect to such investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for
other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger
Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent will promptly replace or restore
the portion of the Payment Fund lost through investments or other events so as
to ensure that the Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level
sufficient to make such payments. 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Stock Plans_.

 

(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the
Company Stock Plans (an " _Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised as
of the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be cancelled as of
the Effective Time and, in exchange therefor, the former holder thereof shall
receive from the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Option and (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock set forth in such Option, less any required
withholding Taxes (the " _Option Cash Payment_ "). As of the Effective Time
each holder of an Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment, without interest. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Option Cash Payment shall be made in respect of any
Option which has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is
equal to or more than the Merger Consideration and holders of such Options
shall not be entitled to receive any payments or consideration whatsoever with
respect to such Options as a result of the Transactions or the cancellation of
such Options. The Option Cash Payment shall be made at the time required
under the applicable Company Stock Plan and related award or other applicable
document, but in any event, subject to _Section 2.3(e)_, promptly (and no
later than 15 Business Days) following the Effective Time.

 



\- 7 - (b) Each award of restricted Company Common Stock granted under the Company
Stock Plans (" _Restricted Stock_ ") that is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become vested at the Effective
Time, and no longer subject to restrictions, (i) in the case of Restricted
Stock subject to performance-based vesting conditions, with respect to the
number of shares of Restricted Stock determined as if the applicable
performance goals had been achieved at the target level of performance at the
end of the applicable performance period and (ii) in the case of Restricted
Stock not subject to performance-based vesting conditions, with respect to the
total number of shares of such Restricted Stock, and in either case such
vested and unrestricted shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as
described in _Section 2.1(a)_ of this Agreement. Promptly (and no later than
15 Business Days) following the Effective Time, any cash dividends previously
paid by the Company with respect to Restricted Stock and held as of the
Effective Time by the Company or its designated agent shall be distributed by
the Company to the holder of such Restricted Stock, less any required
withholding Taxes, to the extent such Restricted Stock has become vested at
the Effective Time in accordance with the preceding sentence.Restricted Stock
that remains unvested and subject to restrictions at the Effective Time (after
giving effect to this _Section 2.3(b)_), and any cash dividends previously
paid by the Company with respect to such Restricted Stock, shall be forfeited
and the holders of such Restricted Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto.

 

(c) Each award of a right under any Company Stock Plan (other than awards of
Options or Restricted Stock, the treatment of which is specified in _Sections
2.3(a)_ and _2.3(b)_ , respectively) entitling the holder thereof to shares of
Company Common Stock or cash equal to or based on the value of Shares (a "
_Share Unit_ ") that is outstanding or payable as of the Effective Time shall
be cancelled as of the Effective Time and, in exchange therefor, the former
holder thereof shall receive from the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i)
(A) in the case of Share Units subject to performance-based vesting
conditions, the number of shares of Company Common Stock determined as if the
applicable performance goals had been achieved at the target level of
performance at the end of the applicable performance period and (B) in the
case of Share Units not subject to performance-based vesting conditions, the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Share Units,
and (ii) the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes (the "
_Share Unit Payment_ "). As of the Effective Time each holder of a Share Unit
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Share Unit Payment, without interest. The Share Unit Payment
shall be made at the time required under the applicable Company Stock Plan and
related award or other applicable document, but in any event, subject to
_Section 2.3(e)_, promptly (and no later than 15 Business Days) following
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that such payment
would cause any additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to Section 409A of the
Code with respect to a Share Unit, the payment shall instead be made at the
time specified in the applicable Company Stock Plan and related award or other
applicable document.

 

(d) All account balances (whether or not vested) under the OM Group, Inc.
Deferred Compensation Plan, effective as of July 1, 2008, that are notionally
invested in a number of shares of Company Common Stock, the " _Deferred
Compensation Plan_ ", shall be adjusted and converted into a right of the
holder to have allocated to the holders account under the
Deferred Compensation Plan an amount denominated in cash equal to the product
of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock deemed invested under or
otherwise referenced by such account immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the

 



\- 8 -  " _Deferred Payment_ "), and shall cease to represent a right to receive a
number of shares of Company Common Stock or cash equal to or based on the
value of a number of Shares. The Deferred Payment shall be made at the time
specified in the Deferred Compensation Plan and related plan documents, less
any required withholding Taxes.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such lawful
actions as may be necessary (which include satisfying the requirements of
Rule 16b-3(E) promulgated under the Exchange Act) to provide for and give
effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.3_. All Company
Stock Plans shall be terminated prior to or as of the
Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no
event shall any amount be paid to any holder of Options or Share Units under
this Agreement until such holder delivers to the Company, with copies to
Parent and Carve-out Buyer, a properly completed and duly executed surrender
form in respect of all Options and Share Units, as applicable, held by such
Person in substantially the form set forth in _Section 2.3(e)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions shall not provide any holder of an
award or right under any Company Stock Plan with the right to acquire any
capital stock or other equity interest (including any "phantom" stock or
stock appreciation rights) in the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Carve-out
Buyer or their respective Affiliates.

 

Section 2.4 _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares held by a stockholder who has not voted in
favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and has properly demanded
appraisal of such Shares pursuant to, and who has complied in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time and, instead, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the "fair
value" of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,
unless and until the holder of such shares (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ")
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to
appraisal. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled
and cease to exist and any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in respect
thereof shall represent only the rights provided by Section 262 of the DGCL
and all Dissenting Stockholders shall be entitled only to those rights
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time a
Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such
holders right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then such
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as of the Effective Time,
without interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice (and in
any event within forty-eight hours) of any demands for appraisal, withdrawals
or attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments received by
the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal, and Parent shall
have the right to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demands except as required by applicable Law. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or
compromise, settle or compromise any such demands, approve any withdrawal of
any such demands, waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal in accordance with the DGCL or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



\- 9 - Section 2.5 _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of capital stock, of the Company shall occur as a
result of any merger, business combination, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision
or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, then any number or
amount contained herein that is based upon the number of Shares will be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock and
awards under any Company Stock Plan the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event.

Section 3.1  _Organization_.

other entity duly incorporated or formed, as applicable and duly organized,

its incorporation or organization and has all requisite corporate or other
organizational power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted, except in the case of the Subsidiaries of the Company, where

individually or in the aggregate, material to the business and operations of
(i) the SC Business taken as a whole or (ii) the OMB Business taken as a
whole.

 

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is qualified or duly licensed to

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) VAC Netherlands has, and at all times during its existence has had, no
Liabilities (other than those immaterial liabilities incidental to its
formation), assets (other than all of the outstanding membership interests of

avoidance of doubt, shall not include the Carve-out Transaction, the Financing
and the transactions related thereto), have been duly and validly authorized

other corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize

other Transaction Documents to which the Company is a party have been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due and valid
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and such Transaction

determined that the Merger is fair to and in the best interests of the

applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which its or any
of their respective properties are bound or (iii) result in any breach or
violation of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse
of time or both would become a default) or require a consent or result in the
loss of a benefit under, or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, amendment or acceleration of, any Contract to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or any of their respective properties or assets are bound
or result in the creation of any Encumbrance (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
conflict, violation, breach, default, loss, termination, cancellation,
amendment or acceleration or other occurrence which (A) would not prevent,
impair or materially delay, or reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or
materially delay, the Company from performing its obligations under this
Agreement and consummating the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the
Carve-out Transaction, the Financing and the transactions related thereto) in

materially delay the Company from performing its obligations under this
Agreement in any material respect, or (B) would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, each
Subsidiary of the Company have been validly issued and are owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company, by another Subsidiary of the Company or by the
Company and another Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of all

Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

 

Section 4.1 _Organization_.

 



\- 34 - (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, not being in receivership, judicial management,

Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub is qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing, or to have such power or authority, would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding capital
stock of Merger Sub free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims,
pledges, agreements, limitations in voting rights, charges or other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. On or prior to the date required
herein, Parent has provided to the Company the name of the "ultimate parent

directors of Merger Sub, and, except for Parents adoption of this Agreement
as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, no other corporate or other entity action
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub is necessary to authorize the execution,

other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the consummation of the

give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration
of, any Contracts to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which Parent

Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

Section 4.6 _Financing_.

 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent (or a Subsidiary thereof) has
received (i) an executed equity commitment letter dated the date hereof (the
" _Equity Commitment Letter_ ") from Guarantor A to provide equity financing
to Parent in an aggregate amount of $210,000,000, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "), and (ii) an
executed debt commitment letter dated the date hereof (as may be amended or

Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the "
_Commitment Letters_ ") from Credit Suisse AG and Credit Suisse Securities
(USA) LLC, who have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, to provide the amount of financing set forth in the Debt Commitment

related to the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof has been
provided to the Company, except that the numerical fees and pricing "flex

(b) Each of Merger Sub and Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees
or other fees required by such Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the
date hereof. As of the date hereof, each Commitment Letter is a legal, valid
and binding obligation of Merger Sub and Parent, as applicable, and, to the
Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, each other party thereto, and in full
force and effect except that such enforcement may be subject to General

(c) Assuming the Parents Financing is funded in accordance with the
Commitment Letters, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Commitment
Letters, together with available cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
the cash provided by Carve-out Buyer, will be sufficient for Parent and Merger
Sub and, after the Closing, the Company to complete the Transactions, and
to satisfy all of the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under

could otherwise adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability or
availability of the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to all or any portion
of Parents Debt Financing, in each case, other than as expressly set forth in
the applicable Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, neither Merger Sub
or Parent has any Knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would be

date on which the Closing should occur pursuant to _Section 1.2_.

delivered to the Company the duly executed Limited Guaranty. The Limited
Guaranty is in full force and effect, has not been amended or modified, and is

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or
hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally and (B) equitable
remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the
court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. As of the date
hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default on the part of Guarantor A under the Limited
Guaranty.

Section 4.7 _No Prior Activities_. Merger Sub has been formed solely for
the purpose of engaging in the Transactions and the Financing and prior to
the Effective Time will have engaged in no other business activities and will

stock of Merger Sub is, and immediately prior to the Effective Time will be,
owned by Parent.

 

Section 4.8 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened by any
Governmental Entity, against Parent or Merger Sub which would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is a party or subject to or in default
under any Order which would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



\- 38 - Section 4.9 No _Vote of Parent Stockholders_. Except for the adoption of the
Agreement by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, no vote of the
members of Parent or the holders of any securities of Parent (equity or
otherwise), is required by any applicable Law, the certificate of formation or
limited liability company agreement of Parent (or similar organizational
documents) or the applicable rules of any exchange on which securities of
Parent are traded, in order for Parent to consummate the Merger.

Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger have been satisfied or waived,
(b) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that
were, at the time made, and continue to be, at the Effective
Time, reasonable, (c) the most recent Company Financial Statements fairly
present the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the end of the periods covered thereby and the consolidated
results of operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods
covered thereby, and (d) accuracy and completeness of the representations and
warranties in _Article III_ , then immediately following the Effective Time
and after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions and the
Financing, the payment of the aggregate consideration to which the
stockholders and other equityholders of the Company are entitled under
_Article II_ , funding of any obligations of the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries which become due or payable by the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries in connection with, or as a result of, the Merger, any required
refinancings or repayments of existing Indebtedness of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and payment of and related fees, expenses and other amounts
required to be paid in connection with this Agreement and the Financing, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will not: (i)
be insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum of
its debts, including contingent and other liabilities, is greater than the
fair market value of its assets or because the fair saleable value of its
assets is less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its
existing debts, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature);
(ii) have unreasonably small capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged; or (iii) have incurred debts,
or intend to incur debts, including contingent and other liabilities, beyond
its ability to pay such debts as they become due.

that neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any other Person has made any
express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of the Company or any
of its Affiliates as to the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding the Company provided to Parent and Merger Sub, except as
expressly set forth in _Article III_ (which are qualified by the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Company SEC Documents, as applicable). In connection
with any investigation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger Sub have received or may receive from the
Company and/or its Affiliates and/or other Persons on behalf of the Company
certain projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts and
certain business plan information in written or verbal communications. Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting
to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Parent
and Merger Sub are familiar with such

 



\- 39 -  uncertainties, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for
making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts or plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub shall have no claim
against the Company or any other Person with respect thereto, except in the
case of fraud. Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that neither the
Company nor any other Person on behalf of the Company makes any representation
or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts or
plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts or plans). Except for the representations
and warranties in this _Article IV_ , neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any
other Person makes any express or implied representation or warranty on
behalf of Parent of its Affiliates.

the purpose of engaging in the Transactions and the Carve-out Buyers Debt
Financing and prior to the Effective Time will have engaged in no other
business activities and will have incurred no liabilities or obligations other

its formation). As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock
of Carve-out Buyer consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01
per share, 100 of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of Carve-out Buyer is, and immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be, indirectly owned by Guarantor P.

 

Section 5.8 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of Carve-out Buyer, threatened by any
Governmental Entity, against Carve-out Buyer which would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Carve-out Buyer Material
Adverse Effect. Carve-out Buyer is not a party or subject to or in default
under any Order which would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Carve-
out Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.9 _No Vote of Carve-out Buyer Stockholders_. No vote of the
stockholders of Carve-out Buyer or the holders of any other securities of

organizational documents) or the applicable rules of any exchange on which
securities of Carve-out Buyer are traded, in order for Carve-out Buyer to
consummate the Merger.

 

Section 5.10 _Solvency_. Assuming that (a) the conditions to the obligation of
Carve-out Buyer to consummate the Carve-out Transaction have been satisfied
or waived, (b) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions
that were, at the time made, and continue to be, at the Effective Time,
reasonable, (c) the most recent Company Financial Statements fairly present
the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the end of the periods covered thereby and the consolidated results
of operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods covered
thereby, and (d) accuracy and completeness of the representations and
warranties in _Article III_ , then immediately following the consummation of
the Carve-out Transaction and after giving effect to Carve-out Buyers Debt
Financing, Carve-out Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will not:
(i) be insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum
of its debts, including contingent and other liabilities, is greater than the
fair market value of its assets or because the fair saleable value of its
assets is less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its
existing debts, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature);
(ii) have unreasonably small capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged; or (iii) have incurred debts,
or intend to incur debts, including contingent and other liabilities, beyond
its ability to pay such debts as they become due.

Section 5.11 _Disclaimer of Warranties_. Carve-out Buyer acknowledges that
neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any other Person has made any
express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of the Company or any
of its Affiliates as to the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding the Company provided to Carve-out Buyer, except as

 



\- 44 -  expressly set forth in _Article III_ (which are qualified by the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Company SEC Documents, as applicable). In connection
with any investigation by Carve-out Buyer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Carve-out Buyer has received or may receive from the Company
and/or its Affiliates and/or other Persons on behalf of the Company certain
projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts and certain
business plan information in written or verbal communications. Carve-out Buyer
acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Carve-out Buyer
is familiar with such uncertainties, that Carve-out Buyer is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to them
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts or plans), and that Carve-out Buyer shall have no claim
against the Company or any other Person with respect thereto, except in the
case of fraud. Accordingly, Carve-out Buyer acknowledges that neither the
Company nor any other Person on behalf of the Company makes any representation
or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts or plans). Except for the representations and
warranties in this _Article_ V, neither Carve-out Buyer nor any other Person
makes any express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of Carve-
out Buyer of its Affiliates.

Proposal, or (G) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing (the actions
described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) take any action pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 6.2(e)_,
prior to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board
may, in response to a written Company Takeover Proposal, (x) make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with this _Section 6.2(f)_, or
(y) terminate this Agreement to concurrently enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ in connection with such Company
Takeover Proposal, but only if, prior to taking any such action:

 



\- 53 - (i) the Company Board or any duly constituted or authorized committee
thereof shall have reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that (x) such written
Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, and (y)
that the failure to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement to concurrently enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ in connection with such Company
Superior Proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

(ii) the Company shall have first provided written notice to Parent and
Carve-out Buyer in advance of taking such action that it is prepared to make
(x) an Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with this _Section
6.2(f)_, or (y) terminate this Agreement to concurrently enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal, which
notice shall include the material terms and conditions of the transaction that
constitutes the Company Superior Proposal that is the basis for the proposed
action of the Company Board, the identity of the Person making such Company
Superior Proposal and a copy of all of the material transaction documents in
respect of such Company Superior Proposal (including the then current form
of definitive agreement for such Company Superior Proposal, if any);

(iii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the
Notice Period, negotiate with Parent, Carve-out Buyer and their respective
Representatives, to the extent Parent, Carve-out Buyer and their respective
Representatives wish to negotiate, in good faith to make such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Takeover
Proposal no longer constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; and

 

(iv) Parent and Carve-out Buyer have not, within three Business Days after the
receipt of such notice (it being understood that any material revision,
amendment, update or supplement to the terms and conditions of such Company
Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional two Business
Day period) (any such notice period, the " _Notice Period_ "), made a
proposal that the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith, after
consultation with its legal counsel and financial advisor, causes the Company
Takeover Proposal that was previously determined to constitute a Company
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 6.2(f)_, and any such purported termination shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be void and of no force or effect,
unless (A) at or concurrently with such termination the Company pays the
Termination Fee in full and otherwise complies with the provisions of 
_Section 9.1(c)_, and (B) the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives have not breached this _Section 6.2_ in any material respect.

 



\- 54 - (g) Notwithstanding _Section 6.2(e)_, prior to the time the Stockholder
Approval is obtained, the Company Board may change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw
or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or the Carve-out Buyer, the
Company Recommendation (" _Change of Recommendation_ ") if the Company Board
has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisor, that failure to make such Change of
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law as a result of an event, fact, circumstance, development or
occurrence that materially affects the business, assets or operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that is unknown and is not reasonably
foreseeable to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement and becomes
known to the Company Board prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval (an "
_Intervening Event_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such action shall not
be in response to a Company Takeover Proposal or a Company Superior Proposal
(which is governed by _Section 6.2(f)_) or relate to Parent, Carve-out Buyer
or their respective Affiliates and prior to taking such action, (i) the
Company Board has given Parent and Carve-out Buyer at least four Business
Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a
description of the reasons for the Change of Recommendation (it being
understood that any material changes in respect of such Intervening Event
shall require a new notice and an additional one Business Day notice period),
(ii) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent, Carve-out Buyer and their respective
Representatives during such notice period after giving any such notice, to the
extent Parent and Carve-out Buyer wish to negotiate, to make such adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the need for making
such Change of Recommendation would be obviated and (iii) at the end of such
notice period, the Company Board or any duly constituted and authorized
committee thereof shall have considered in good faith such adjustments, and
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and legal counsel, that failure to effect a Change of Recommendation
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law as a result of such Intervening Event.

(h) The Company agrees that any violation of this _Section 6.2_ by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries respective Representatives shall be deemed a breach of this
_Section 6.2_ by the Company and any material breach of this _Section 6.2_
by the Company or any of the foregoing shall be deemed a deliberate and
material breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 

(i) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_ or in _Section 7.9_ shall
prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure to the
Companys stockholders if, in the Company Boards reasonable determination in
good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to so
disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure shall be deemed a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change (in which case _Section 6.2(f)_ shall apply)
unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company
Recommendation in such disclosure.

or its Subsidiaries or (y) otherwise take or commit to take any actions that
after the Closing Date that could limit the freedom of Parent, Carve-out
Buyer or their respective Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporations) freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporations) businesses, product lines or assets.

(c) The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Carve-out Buyer shall cooperate and
consult with each other in connection with the making of all registrations,
filings, notifications, communications, submissions, and any other material
actions pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, and subject to applicable

Company, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and Carve-out Buyer, on the
other hand, shall keep each other apprised in all material respects of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the Transactions, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications
received by the Company, Parent or Carve-out Buyer, as the case may be, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions. Subject to
applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and Carve-out Buyer, on the other
hand, shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, any proposed notifications or filings and any written

references concerning the valuation of the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, or proposals from third parties with respect thereto, (y) as
necessary to comply with contractual agreements and (z) as necessary to

and Parent, Merger Sub and Carve-out Buyer, on the other hand, agrees not to
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in Person or by
telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate.

 



\- 58 - (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section 7.3_, if any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Law, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
and Carve-out Buyer shall be required to contest or resist any such action or
proceeding or to take any action to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, restrains, delays or restricts consummation of the Merger and the
other Transactions. The foregoing notwithstanding or any other provision of
this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 7.3_ shall limit a partys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ or _Section
9.1(b)(ii)_ so long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied in
all respects with its obligations under this _Section 7.3_.

Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would, or would reasonably be

of the other Transactions. If any Takeover Law shall become applicable to
the Transactions, the Company and the Company Board shall grant such
approvals and shall use reasonable best efforts to take such actions so that
the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise use reasonable best efforts to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the Transactions.

(a) Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent
and Carve-out Buyer, and Parent and Carve-out Buyer shall give prompt notice
to the Company of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose
occurrence or non-occurrence would be reasonably likely to cause any condition
to the Transactions to be unsatisfied at the Effective Time, (ii)
any Transaction Claim (other than any Transaction Claim relating solely to a
demand for appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, notice of which shall be
governed by _Section 2.4_) or (iii) any material failure of the Company
or Parent, Merger Sub

 



\- 59 -  and Carve-out Buyer, as the case may be, or any officer, director, employee
or Representative of the Company or Parent, Merger Sub and Carve-out Buyer, as
applicable, to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such notification shall affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the
obligations of, the parties hereunder.

(b) The Company shall promptly provide copies to Parent of all proceedings
and correspondence relating to any Transaction Claim. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate with the Company regarding the defense
or settlement of any Transaction Claim, and shall give due consideration to
Parents advice with respect to such Transaction Claim. Subject to _Section
6.1(b)(xviii)_ and _Section 2.4_, the Company shall not settle any
Transaction Claim unless the settlement contains a full and unconditional and
irrevocable release of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent, Merger Sub,
Carve-out Buyer and their respective Affiliates, including Guarantor A and
Guarantor P (and their respective Affiliates), and the Representatives of each
of the foregoing.

 

Section 7.8 _Access; Confidentiality_. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement and applicable Law relating to the sharing of information, the
Company agrees to and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide Parent, Carve-
out Buyer and their respective Representatives (including the Financing
Sources), from time to time prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or
the termination of this Agreement, reasonable access (which, in the case of
unaffiliated third party Representatives, shall require the use of reasonable
best efforts to provide such access) during normal business hours to (i) the
Companys and its Subsidiaries senior executives, independent auditors,
officers, employees, Representatives, properties, commitments, Contracts,
books and records, (ii) such other information as Parent or Carve-out Buyer
shall reasonably request, in each case, to the extent reasonably required to
consummate the Transactions ( _provided_ , that Parent, Carve-out Buyer and
their respective Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company, and no access shall be granted to conduct any environmental or
intrusive sampling or testing without the Companys prior written consent in
its sole discretion), and (iii) such other information as Parent may
reasonably request relating to the repositioning process with the works
council in Germany. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company shall not be
required to afford such access if the Company determines, in its
reasonable best judgment (after consultation with outside counsel), it would
cause a violation of an obligation of confidentiality pursuant to an agreement
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party so long as the
Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such
third party to such access, would cause a risk of a loss of attorney-client
privilege to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or that is competitively
sensitive information ( _provided_  that the Company will reasonably
cooperate with Parent and/or Carve-out Buyer to provide such access, including
by entering into a joint defense agreement or "clean team" or similar
agreement, with Parent or Carve-out Buyer if requested with respect to any
such information), would cause a risk of a loss of trade secret protection to
the Company or its Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any
applicable Law. Each of Parent, Carve-out Buyer and the Company hereby
agrees that until the Effective Time, all information provided to it or any
of its Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions shall be deemed to be Confidential Information, as such
term is used in, and shall be treated in accordance with, the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



\- 60 - Section 7.9 _Publicity_. Parent, Carve-out Buyer and the Company agree to
issue a joint press release announcing this Agreement. Following such initial
press release, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Carve-out Buyer will
consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon
any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance
of such press release or other public statement or comment relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or
other public statement or comment without the prior written consent of the
other parties (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) except
as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or as may be requested by a
Governmental Entity, in each case, as determined in the good faith judgment of
the party proposing to make such release (in which case such party shall not
issue or cause the publication of such press release or other
public announcement without prior consultation with the parties); _provided_
, that the restrictions in this _Section 7.9_ shall not apply to a Company
communication regarding the beginning of the No-Shop Period Start Date
(including customary disclosures with respect to any solicitations prior
thereto), a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or a Change of
Recommendation.

 

Section 7.10 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent and Carve-out Buyer shall
cause the Surviving Corporation, or, in the case of Carve-out Buyer, any
subsidiary transferred to Carve-out Buyer, to, assume all obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses for each individual who at the Effective Time is, or
at any time prior to the Effective Time was, an Indemnified Party for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the
Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws (or similar
organizational documents of any Subsidiary) as in effect on the date hereof.
For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain,
provisions of the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and
bylaws with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
indemnification and advancement of expenses of officers and directors of
the Company that are the same as those set forth in the Companys Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
Indemnified Party, unless otherwise required by Law. Anything to the contrary
in this _Section 7.10(a)_, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-
laws notwithstanding, any Person to whom advancement of expenses is provided
shall be required to provide, as a condition to such advancement, an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined under
applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled
to indemnification.

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will maintain, and Parent will cause to be maintained in effect
the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
as disclosed on _Section 7.10_ of the Company Disclosure Letter with respect
to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not be required
to pay in the aggregate for such 

 



\- 61 -  coverage more than 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior
to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant
hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount. The Company may purchase, prior to the Effective
Time, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy at a cost no greater than the aggregate
amount that the Surviving Corporation would be required to spend during the
six-year period provided for in this _Section 7.10(b)_ on terms and
conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits as the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring
prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Transactions. If
such prepaid "tail policy" has been obtained by the Company in accordance
with this _Section 7.10(b)_, it will be deemed to satisfy all obligations to
obtain insurance pursuant to this _Section 7.10(b)_ and the Surviving
Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of
its obligations thereunder.

(c) Parent or the Surviving Corporation will have the right, but not the
obligation, to assume and control the defense of any threatened or actual
litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered
under this _Section 7.10_ (each, a " _Claim_ "), provided that none of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation will settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any such Claim for which indemnification has been
sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise
or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability arising out of, and no admission of wrongdoing in respect of,
such Claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such
settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any Claim and
will provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested
and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.10_ will survive the consummation of
the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party, and his or her heirs and his or her representatives,
and are in addition to, and not in substitution of, any other rights to
indemnification or advancement that any such individual may have under
the Restricted Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws (or similar
organizational document of any subsidiary), by Contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 7.10_
may not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the
rights of any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 7.10_ applies unless
(i) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (ii) the
affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this _Section 7.10_ applies will be third party beneficiaries
of this  _Section 7.10_).

(e) Except with respect to the Carve-out Transaction, in the event Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person
then, and in either such case, proper provision will be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section 7.10_.

 



\- 62 - Section 7.11 _Merger Sub Compliance_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply
with all of its obligations under or related to this Agreement. Parent shall
adopt this Agreement as sole stockholder of Merger Sub as soon as possible
after the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 7.12 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on the one-year
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Carve-out Buyer shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, to current employees of the SC Business whose
terms and conditions of employment were not, and do not become, subject to a
collective bargaining agreement (the " _SC Non-Union Employees_") (i) base
compensation and annual cash bonus opportunities that, in each case, are no

satisfaction with such filing, the Company shall file such Current Report on
Form 8-K.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Carve-out Buyer may, to most

other transactions related to such steps plan as may be reasonably requested
by Parent and Carve-out Buyer so long as such other reasonably requested
transactions are not reasonably anticipated to result in any material impact
to the Company or materially delay or otherwise materially impede the
Closing. In the event the Closing does not occur, Parent shall reimburse the
Company for all documented and reasonable costs and expenses incurred as a
result of the taking of any transactions that are not set forth on the steps

the Carve-out Buyer and Parent and Merger Sub and use reasonable best

shall refrain from taking actions to effect any internal reorganization to
implement the Carve-out Transaction without the prior written consent of
Parent and the Carve-out Buyer; _provided_ , that this _Section 7.16_ shall
not require the Company to take any corporate action, including any
reorganization not permitted by _Section 7.15_, or to execute any document or
other instrument or to incur any liability that is not conditioned upon the
Closing.

 

Section 7.17 _IP Title Defect Correction Actions_. From and after the date
hereof until the Closing, to the extent that any material Company
Intellectual Property is not in the current legal name of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, is subject to a chain of title defect, or is subject to any form
of Encumbrance (other than a Permitted Encumbrance), Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with and assist the Parent in the preparation, execution, filing

 



\- 74 -  and recordation of all instruments and documents necessary to cure such
title defects, provide for current ownership of the asset by the Company and

Intellectual Property by the Closing Date as promptly as practicable (all such
actions, the " _IP Title Defect Correction Actions_"). The Company and each
of its subsidiaries shall be responsible for and pay its own expenses
incurred as a result of such cooperation and assistance in connection with any
IP Title Defect Correction Actions taken by the Company and/or Parent. The
failure by the Company to take any IP Title Defect Correction Actions shall
not prevent the Closing.

Section 7.18 _Tax Returns; Tax Filings_. Parent shall be entitled to request,
and, subject to the Companys consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,

cooperate with Parent in connection with and cause, at Parents sole expense

case, with respect to Taxes as Parent may reasonably determine are necessary
or useful to effectuate the Transactions and/or to mitigate any Tax costs
associated with the Transactions and related restructuring requirements. In
the event this Agreement is terminated, Parent shall indemnify the Company
for any and all Losses, Liabilities, costs and expenses related to any request
made by Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.18_ (except, for the avoidance of
doubt, with respect to any Losses, Liabilities, costs and expenses related to
the restructuring of the Company as contemplated by _Section 7.15_).

Section 7.19 _Preparation of Audited Financial Statements for the SC
Business_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, (a) the Company
and Carve-out Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to prepare (i)
audited annual consolidated or consolidating (as the parties shall determine)
financial statements of the SC Business (prepared in accordance with
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, except §210.3-05 and Article 11
thereof, and in a form appropriate to be included in a securities offering
registered in accordance with the Securities Act), together with all related
notes and schedules thereto, accompanied by the report thereon of the

have been reviewed by auditors in accordance with Statements on Auditing
Standards 100 for any relevant interim quarterly periods and prepared in

out Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the preparation of,
pro forma financial information for the SC Business, on a stand-alone basis,
complying with S-X Article 11 for both annual and quarterly periods
(collectively, " _Carve-out Financial Statements_ "). The audited portions of
the Carve-Out Financial Statements will cover the fiscal year ended December
31, 2014, the unaudited portion of the Carve-out Financial Statements will
cover each interim quarterly period thereafter until Closing and the pro forma
portions of the Carve-out Financial Statements will cover both
periods. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the Company
shall permit Carve-Out Buyer to hire an internationally recognized accounting
firm (the " _Accountants_ ") to be mutually agreed to by the Company and the
Carve-out Buyer (it being agreed that Ernst and Young LLP are acceptable to
both the Company and Carve-out Buyer), to conduct an audit of the Carve-out
Financial Statements. The cost and expense of conducting such audit and
preparation of the Carve-out Financial Statements shall be paid by Carve-out
Buyer, including reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
borne by Company to support and facilitate such audit. In connection with the
preparation of the Carve-out Financial Statements,

 



\- 75 -  the Company shall cooperate, to the extent within its control, with Carve-
out Buyer and the Accountants and, subject to Section 7.8, shall give, and
shall cause the Companys Affiliates to give, to the Accountants reasonable
access to the books, records and other materials of the Company and the
personnel of, and work papers prepared by or for, the Company, including such
historical financial information relating to the SC Business as the
Accountants may reasonably request, in each case, in order to permit the
timely completion of the Carve-out Financial Statements in accordance with
this _Section 7.19_. As amplification and not limitation of the
foregoing, Companys cooperation required by this _Section 7.19_ shall
include the items specified on _Section 7.19_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination; Termination Fees_.

 

(a) _Effect of Termination_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_,
this Agreement shall forthwith become null, void and of no effect with no
liability or obligation on the part of any party (or any direct or indirect
equity holder, stockholder, partner, controlling person, member, manager,
director, officer, employee, Affiliate or Representative of such party or of
such partys Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , that subject in all
respects to this _Section 9.2_, _Section 10.10_ and  _Section 10.11_, the
provisions of _Section 7.9_, the indemnification and reimbursement
obligations of _Section 7.14_, _Section 7.16_, _Section 7.18_, this
_Section 9.2_, _Article_ X and _Article XI_ hereof and the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive such termination, in each case, in
accordance with its terms and conditions; _provided_ , _further_ , that (w) no
such termination shall relieve any party of its obligation to pay the
Termination Fee, the Reverse Termination Fee, the Parent Expenses, the Company
Expenses or the COB Expenses, in each case, if, as and when required pursuant
to this _Section 9.2_, (x) subject to this _Section 9.2_, the Company shall
not be relieved or released from any liability or obligation for damages
available under applicable Law arising out of any (A) knowing material breach
of any of its representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, (B)
deliberate material breach of any of its covenants contained in this

relieved or

 



\- 80 -  released from liability for damages available under applicable Law arising
out of its fraud, and (z) subject in all respects to this _Section 9.2_,

or released from liability for damages available under applicable Law arising

10.10_ and  _Section 10.11_, for the avoidance of doubt, in determining
losses or damages recoverable upon valid termination of this Agreement by a
party hereto for the other partys breach of this Agreement, the parties
acknowledge and agree that such losses and damages shall include the benefit
of the bargain lost by any non-breaching party who has validly terminated this
Agreement (taking into consideration all relevant matters, including
opportunity costs and the time value of money). No party claiming that such
breach occurred will have any duty or otherwise be obligated to mitigate any
such damages. For purposes of this _Section 9.2_, (A) a "knowing" breach of a
representation and warranty will be deemed to have occurred only if the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or Carve-out Buyer had actual Knowledge that
making such representation or warranty would cause, or would be reasonably
expected to cause, a breach of this Agreement and (B) a "deliberate" breach
of any covenant or agreement will be deemed to have occurred only if the
relevant party took or failed to take action with actual Knowledge that the
action so taken or omitted to be taken would, or would reasonably be expected
to, constitute a breach of such covenant or agreement. The Company, Parent,
Merger Sub and Carve-out Buyer each agree and acknowledge that the individuals
specified in the definition of "Knowledge", as applicable, (1) have read this
Agreement, including the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants
contained herein, (2) have reviewed with counsel the representations,
warranties and covenants contained herein and (3) for purposes of this 
_Section 9.2(a)_, shall be deemed to understand the meanings of the
representations, warranties and covenants contained herein.

pursuant to the provisions of  _Section 9.1(d)_, (B) this Agreement is
validly terminated by the Company pursuant to the provisions of _Section
9.1(c)_ or (C) (1) after the date of this Agreement, a Company Takeover
Proposal (substituting "fifty percent (50%)" for the fifteen percent (15%)
threshold set forth in the definition of "Company Takeover Proposal") (a "
_Qualifying Transaction_ ") is publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior
to the Special Meeting, (2) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent
and Carve-out Buyer, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand,
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_, or by Parent
and Carve-out Buyer pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ and (3) at any time on or
prior to the 12-month anniversary of such termination, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has entered into a definitive agreement providing for a
Qualifying Transaction or completed a Qualifying Transaction, in each case,
the Company shall pay to each of Parent and Carve-out Buyer (or one or more of
their respective designees) its Pro Rata Portion of the Termination Fee, such
Termination Fee to be due (x) in the case of clause (A) of this _Section
9.2(b)_, concurrently with such termination and payable in accordance with
_Section 9.2(b)(iii)_, (y) in the case of clause (B) of this  _Section
9.2(b)_, concurrently with such termination and payable in accordance with

9.2(b)_, concurrently with the earlier of entering into such definitive
agreement with respect to such Qualifying Transaction and consummation of such

than one occasion.

 



\- 81 - (ii) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent and Carve-out
Buyer pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_, and such termination was the result of

covenants or agreements in this Agreement, the Company shall pay to Parent and
Carve-out Buyer (or one or more of their respective designees) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (to accounts designated by Parent and
Carve-out Buyer) an amount equal to the Parent Expenses and the COB Expenses,
respectively, and such payment shall be made within two Business Days after
such termination.

the Termination Fee shall constitute liquidated damages, and upon payment of
the Termination Fee in full, if, as and when required pursuant to this
_Section 9.2_, the Company shall have no further liability of any kind for
any reason in connection with this Agreement or the valid termination
contemplated hereby other than as provided under this _Section 9.2(b)_;
_provided_ that prior to the payment of the Termination Fee, if, as and when
due pursuant to this _Section 9.2_, the Company shall provide Parent and

Fee and, within seven Business Days of receipt of such written notice, Parent
and Carve-out Buyer will be required to provide irrevocable and unconditional
confirmation to the Company in writing that they intend to either (but not
both) (A) receive payment of the Termination Fee, in which case, such
Termination Fee will be paid by the Company to each of Parent and Carve-out
Buyer (or their respective designees) in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Portion by wire transfer (to the accounts designated by Parent and Carve-
out Buyer in such notice) in immediately available funds within two Business
Days of such written confirmation or (B) directly or indirectly, pursue an
award of damages, subject to irrevocably and unconditionally agreeing not to
(and causing their respective Affiliates not to) exercise, and agreeing to
waive, any and all claims and rights they have (or their respective
Affiliates) may have to the Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, under no circumstances whatsoever will Parent and Carve-out
Buyer be entitled to receive both an award of monetary damages and payment of
all or any portion of the Termination Fee.

(c) _Reverse Termination Fee; Expenses_.

(i) If this Agreement is (w) validly terminated by the Company pursuant to 
_Section 9.1(g)_ or (x) (i) validly terminated (A) by the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.1(e)_ or (B) by the Company, Parent or Carve-out Buyer pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)(i)_ or  _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ (in each case, at a time when
this Agreement was terminable by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_),
and (ii) at the time of such valid termination, all of the conditions set
forth in  _Section 8.1(a)_ and _Section 8.2_ have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
each of which would be satisfied at the Closing if there were a Closing),
then, in consideration of the Company irrevocably and unconditionally
agreeing not to (and causing its Affiliates not to) exercise, and agreeing to
waive, any and all claims and rights

 



\- 82 -  it (or its Affiliates) may have against the Non-Recourse Persons under, in
connection with or related to the Transaction Documents, the Transactions and
the Financing (or the failure to consummate the Transactions and the
Financing), then each of Parent and Carve-out Buyer shall pay to the Company
its Pro Rata Portion of the Reverse Termination Fee following the date on
which this Agreement is so terminated in accordance with  _Section
9.2(c)(iii)_.

(ii) In no event shall either Parent or Carve-out Buyer be required to pay its
Pro Rata Portion of the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion and
under no circumstances whatsoever will Parent or Carve-out Buyer be required
to pay more than its Pro Rata Portion of the Reverse Termination Fee.

 

(iii) Prior to the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, if, as and when due
pursuant to this _Section 9.2_, Parent and Carve-out Buyer shall provide the
Company with written notice of their intention to pay such Reverse Termination
Fee and, within seven Business Days of receipt of such written notice, the
Company shall be required to provide irrevocable and unconditional
confirmation in writing to Parent and Carve-out Buyer that it intends to
either (but not both), subject in all respects to this _Section 9.2_,
_Section 10.10_ and _Section 10.11_, (A) receive payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee, in which case, Parent and Carve-out Buyer shall each pay to
the Company its Pro Rata Portion of the Reverse Termination Fee by wire
transfer (to the account designated by the Company in such notice)
in immediately available funds within two Business Days of such confirmation
in writing or (B) directly or indirectly, pursue an award of damages for fraud
as permitted by _Section 9.2_, subject to irrevocably and
unconditionally agreeing not to (and causing its Affiliates not to) exercise,
and agreeing to waive, any and all claims and rights it (or its Affiliates)
may have against the Non-Recourse Persons to the Reverse Termination Fee, and
Parent and Carve-out Buyer shall not be required to pay all or any portion of
the Reverse Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
under no circumstances whatsoever will the Company be entitled to receive both
money damages and payment of all or any portion of the Reverse Termination
Fee.

(iv) If this Agreement is (x) validly terminated pursuant to  _Section
9.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ due to an Order which is final and
nonappealable having been issued or taken by a Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction enjoining, preventing, or otherwise prohibiting consummation
of the Carve-out Transaction and (y) at the time of such termination all of
the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ (other than (i) the receipt of the
Carve-out Buyer Specified Approvals and (ii) if the Special Meeting has not
yet occurred, the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_) and _Section
8.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which would be satisfied at
the Closing if there were a Closing) and, in each case, the sole reason for
such termination shall be that the Carve-out Buyer Specified Approvals have
not been obtained prior to such termination, then, in consideration of the
Company irrevocably and unconditionally agreeing not to (and causing its
Affiliates not to) exercise, and agreeing to waive, any and all claims and
rights it or its Affiliates may have against the Non-Recourse Persons under,
in connection with or related to the Transaction Documents and the
Transactions (or the failure to consummate the

 



\- 83 -  Transactions), then Carve-out Buyer shall pay to the Company the Company
Expenses by wire transfer (to an account designated by the Company) in
immediately available funds within three Business Days after the date on
which this Agreement is so terminated. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Companys sole remedy with respect to a termination of
the Agreement under the circumstances described in this  _Section
9.2(c)(iv)_ shall be the payment to the Company of the Company Expenses and
under no circumstances whatsoever will the Company be entitled to receive all
or any portion of the Reverse Termination Fee as a result of termination
of this Agreement under the circumstances described in this _Section
9.2(c)(iv)_, nor shall the Company be entitled to seek any damages for fraud
as permitted by _Section 9.2_ or specific performance as permitted by 
_Section 10.10_ so long as Carve-out Buyer shall pay the Company Expenses.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company and Carve-out
Buyer agree and acknowledge that none of Parent, Merger Sub or the other
Parent Non-Recourse Persons will have any liability or obligation whatsoever
to pay all or any portion of the Company Expenses.

(d)  _Liquidated Damages; Limitations_.

(i) The parties acknowledge that payment of the Reverse Termination Fee and
the Termination Fee, as applicable, if, as and when required pursuant to this
_Section 9.2_, shall not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages,
in a reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving such amount in
the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.

(ii) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, but subject
in all respects to this _Section 9.2_, if Parent, Merger Sub or Carve-out
Buyer fails to effect the Closing for any or no reason or Parent, Merger Sub
or Carve-out Buyer otherwise breaches this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents or fails to perform hereunder or thereunder (in any case, whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), then (i) the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_ and (ii) the
Companys right to seek one or all of (but never receive both an award of
monetary damages and payment of all or any portion of the Reverse Termination
Fee), subject in each case and in all respects to this  _Section 9.2_,
_Section 10.10_ and _Section 10.11_, (x) monetary damages for fraud, (y) if,
as and when required pursuant to _Section 9.2(c)_, receipt and payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.2(c)_, together with the
payment of any amounts due pursuant to _Section 9.2(e)_, _Section 10.3_ and
_Section 10.6_ and (z) specific performance pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at
Law, in equity, in Contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company, its
Affiliates, and all of the foregoings Representatives (and any other Person)
against the Non-Recourse Persons for any breach, liability, cost, expense,
obligation, loss or damage suffered as a result thereof or in connection
therewith or related thereto.

 



\- 84 - (iii) Except as provided in _Section 9.2(d)(ii)_, none of the Parent Non-
Recourse Persons will have any liability or obligation to the Company, its
Affiliates, or any of the foregoings respective Representatives (or any other
Person), including consequential, indirect or punitive damages, relating to or
arising out of the Transaction Documents, the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Financing or the Transactions, or the failure of the Transactions to be
consummated, or in respect of any other Contract, document or theory of Law or
equity or in respect of any representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at Law, in Contract, in
tort or otherwise. The Company acknowledges and agrees that none of Parents
Financing Sources or Parents or Merger Subs other financing sources shall
have any liability or obligation to the Company, its Affiliates, or any of the
foregoings respective Representatives (or any other Person) if they breach or
fail to perform (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise) any of their obligations under the Parent Transaction Documents.
Without limiting the foregoing, upon payment of Parents Pro Rata Portion of
the Reverse Termination Fee in full, if, as and when required pursuant to
_Section 9.2(c)_, none of the Parent Non-Recourse Persons shall have any
further liability or obligation to the Company, its Affiliates or any of the
foregoings respective Representatives (or any other Person), including
consequential, indirect or punitive damages, relating to or arising out of the
Parent Transaction Documents, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Financing or
the Transactions, or the failure of the Transactions or the Financing to
be consummated, or in respect of any other Contract, document or theory of
Law or equity or in respect of any representations made or alleged to be made
in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at Law, in Contract,
in tort or otherwise.

(iv) Except as expressly provided in _Section 9.2(d)(ii)_, none of the Carve-
out Buyer Non-Recourse Persons will have any liability or obligation to the
Company, its Affiliates, or any of the foregoings respective Representatives
(or any other Person), including consequential, indirect or punitive damages,
relating to or arising out of the Transaction Documents, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Financing or the Transactions, or the failure of the
Transactions to be consummated, or in respect of any other Contract, document
or theory of Law or equity or in respect of any representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or
at Law, in Contract, in tort or otherwise. The Company acknowledges and agrees
that none of Carve-out Buyers Financing Sources or Carve-out Buyers other
financing sources shall have any liability or obligation to the Company, its
Affiliates, or any of the foregoings respective Representatives (or any other
Person) if they breach or fail to perform (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise) any of their obligations under the Transaction
Documents. Without limiting the foregoing, upon payment of Carve-out Buyers
Pro Rata Portion of the Reverse Termination Fee in full, if, as and
when required pursuant to _Section 9.2(c)_, no Carve-out Buyer Non-Recourse
Person shall have any further liability or obligation to the Company, its
Affiliates, or any of the foregoings respective Representatives (or any other
Person), including consequential, indirect or punitive damages, relating to
or arising out of the Transaction Documents, the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Financing or the Transactions, or the failure of the Transactions or the
Financing to be consummated, or in respect of any other Contract, document or
theory of Law or equity or in respect of any representations made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at Law,
in Contract, in tort or otherwise.

maximum aggregate liability of the Carve-out Buyer Non-Recourse Persons under
the Transaction Documents collectively (including monetary damages for fraud
or breach, whether willful, intentional, unintentional or otherwise), or
in connection with the failure of the Transactions or the Financing to be
consummated, or in respect of any representation made or alleged to have been
made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at Law, in
Contract, in tort or otherwise, together with any payment of its Pro Rata
Portion of the Reverse Termination Fee, shall not under any circumstances
exceed an amount equal to $17,556,000 (the " _Carve-out Buyer Maximum
Liability Amount_ "), and in no event shall the Company, its Affiliates. or
any of the foregoings respective Representatives (or any other Person) seek,
directly or indirectly, to recover against the Carve-out Buyer Non-Recourse
Persons any damages whatsoever (including consequential, indirect or punitive
damages), together with any payment of the Carve-out Buyers Pro Rata Portion
of the Reverse Termination Fee, in excess of the Carve-out Buyer Maximum
Liability Amount and (B) the maximum aggregate liability of the Parent Non-
Recourse Persons under the Transaction Documents (including monetary damages
for fraud or breach, whether willful, intentional, unintentional or
otherwise), or in connection with the failure of the Transactions or
the Financing to be consummated, or in respect of any representation made or
alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in
equity or at Law, in Contract, in tort or otherwise, together with any payment
of its Pro Rata Portion of the Reverse Termination Fee shall not under any
circumstances exceed an amount equal to $45,144,000 (the " _Parent Maximum
Liability Amount_ "), and in no event shall the Company, its Affiliates, or

Termination Fee, in excess of the Parent Maximum Liability Amount.

(e) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.2_ are integral parts of the Transactions, and that, without these
agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and Carve-out Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly,
if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to
_Section 9.2(b)_, or Parent or Carve-out Buyer fails to pay in a timely
manner any amount due pursuant to  _Section 9.2(c)_, and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent, Merger Sub or Carve-out Buyer, on the one hand, or the
Company, on the other hand, commences a claim, action, suit or other
proceeding that results in a final and non-appealable judgment against the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Carve-out Buyer, on the other hand, the
Company or Parent or Carve-out Buyer, as applicable, shall pay to Parent and
Carve-out Buyer or the Company, as applicable, interest on such amount from
and including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the
date of actual payment at the maximum interest rate prescribed by Title 6,
Section 2301(a) of the Delaware Code, together with reasonable legal fees and

enforceable.

interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement shall be governed by and

other than the State of Delaware.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto, on behalf of itself and their respective
Affiliates: (i) agrees that it shall not (and shall cause their respective

purposed assignment not permitted under this _Section 10.9_ shall be null and
void.

 

Section 10.10 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages. It
is accordingly agreed, subject in all respects to this  _Section 10.10_,
that each party hereto shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that
may be available, whether in law or equity) to seek (i) a decree or order of
specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of any
provision of this Agreement and (ii) an injunction restraining any breach or
threatened breach of any provision of this Agreement.

the parties hereto further agree that in no event shall the Company or any
Affiliate thereof (or any of their respective Representatives) be entitled to
enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents or Merger Subs obligation to

this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) or otherwise cause Parent,
Merger Sub or Carve-out Buyer to consummate the Merger, the Carve-out
Transaction, the Financing or the other Transactions (including the obligation
to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration) unless and only if:

(i) all the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ and  _Section 8.2_ have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing; provided that such conditions are capable of
being satisfied at the Closing if there were a Closing);

 

(ii) Parent (either directly or through its Subsidiaries) has received
Parents Debt Financing in full, or such full amount would be funded to
Parent (either directly or through its Subsidiaries) at the Closing if
Parents Equity Financing is funded (provided that Parent and Merger Sub shall
not be required to draw down the Parent Equity Financing or consummate the
Closing or the Carve-out Transaction if the Parent Debt Financing is not in
fact funded at the Closing);

 

(iii) Carve-out Buyer (either directly or through its Subsidiaries) has
received Carve-out Buyers Debt Financing in full, or such full amount will
be funded to Carve-out Buyer (either directly or through its Subsidiaries) at
the Closing, subject only to the consummation of the Closing;

 



\- 93 - (iv) the Company has unconditionally confirmed in writing to Parent
and Carve-out Buyer that (x) all of the conditions set forth in _Section
8.3_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing; provided that such
conditions are capable of being satisfied at the Closing if there were a
Closing) and (y) if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing
and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing would occur (and the Company
has not revoked such confirmation); and

(v) Parent, Carve-out Buyer and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing within
two Business Days after the Companys delivery of such written confirmation.

(c) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary, for the avoidance of
doubt, while the Company may concurrently (i) seek specific performance or
other equitable relief, subject in all respects to this _Section 10.10_, and
(ii) payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, if, as and when required pursuant
to  _Section 9.2(c)_, under no circumstances shall the Company, directly or
indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive (A) both a grant of specific
performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this
Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) or other equitable relief, on the
one hand, and payment of any monetary damages whatsoever or the payment of all
or any portion of the Reverse Termination Fee, on the other hand, or (B) both
payment of any monetary damages, on the one hand, and payment of all or any
portion of the Reverse Termination Fee, on the other hand.

(d) Each party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this _Section 10.10_ on the basis that the
other parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such order or injunction.

 

Section 10.11 _Non-Recourse_. Each of the parties hereto agrees, on behalf of
itself and their respective Affiliates, that all Actions, claims,
obligations, liabilities or causes of action (whether in Contract or in tort,

piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by
reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to: (i) this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document or the Confidentiality Agreement or the
Financing or the Transactions, (ii) the negotiation, execution or performance
of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or any other Transaction
Document (including any representation or warranty made in, in connection
with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
or any other Transaction Document), (iii) any breach or violation of this
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or any other Transaction Document and
(iv) any failure of the Transactions or the Financing to be consummated, in
each case, may be made only against (and are those solely of) the Persons that
are expressly identified as parties to this Agreement. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, each party

 



\- 94 -  hereto covenants, agrees and acknowledges, on behalf of itself and their
respective Affiliates, that no recourse under this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement any other Transaction Document or in connection
with any transactions contemplated thereby or the Financing shall be had
against any other Person, including any Non-Recourse Person, and no other
Person, including any Non-Recourse Person, shall have any liabilities or
obligations (whether in Contract or in tort, in Law or in equity, or granted
by statute, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited
partnership or limited liability company veil) for any claims, causes of
action, obligations or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with
or related in any manner to the items in the immediately preceding clauses (i)
