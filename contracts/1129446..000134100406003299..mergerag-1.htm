THE MERGER

  

2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, on the
Closing Date and at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into Agere, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon
cease and Agere shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger.
Agere, as the surviving corporation of the Merger, is sometimes referred to
herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_."

  

2.2 _The Closing_. The consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") shall take place at a closing to occur at the offices of Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto,
California, 94304, on a date and at a time to be agreed upon by LSI and Agere,
which date shall be no later than the second (2nd) Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of the last to be
satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder), of
such conditions), or at such other location, date and time as LSI and Agere
shall mutually agree upon in writing. The date upon which the Closing shall
actually occur pursuant hereto is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

  

2.3 _The Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, LSI and Agere
shall cause the Merger to be consummated under the DGCL by filing a
certificate of merger in customary form and substance (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
_Delaware Secretary of State_ ") in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the DGCL. The time of such filing and acceptance by the Delaware Secretary
of State, or such later time as may be agreed in writing by LSI and Agere and
specified in the Certificate of Merger is referred to herein as the "
_Effective Time_."

  

2.4 _Effect of the Merger_. The effect of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of Agere and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all

_Section 6.14(b)_ , at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of
Agere shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read identically to the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and such amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation
shall become the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
DGCL and such

Certificate of Incorporation; _provided, however_ , that at the Effective Time

Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

  

(b) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the

  |  

2.7

  |  

_Effect on Capital Stock_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) _Capital Stock of Constituent Companies_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of LSI, Merger Sub,
Agere, or the holders of any of the following securities, the following shall
occur:

  

(i) _Agere Common Stock_. Other than as set forth in _Section
2.7(d)_ , each share of Agere Common Stock that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Agere Common Stock owned by
LSI, Merger Sub or Agere, or by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of LSI, Merger Sub or Agere, in each case immediately prior to the Effective
Time) shall be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the
right to receive 2.16 shares of LSI Common Stock and the associated rights
issued under the LSI Rights Plan (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") and the cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_ (the "
_Common Stock Consideration_ ") upon the surrender of the certificate, if any,
representing such share of Agere Common Stock in the manner provided in
_Section 2.8_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided
in _Section 2.10_).

  

(ii) _Certain Owned Agere Common Stock_. Each share of Agere Common
Stock that is owned by LSI, Merger Sub or Agere, or by any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of LSI, Merger Sub or Agere, in each case immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

  



  

15

  
   



  

(iii) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub
shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

(b) _Adjustment to Exchange Ratio._ The Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into LSI Common Stock or Agere Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to LSI Common Stock or Agere Common Stock having a record date on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

  

(c) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of LSI Common Stock
will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of
record of shares of Agere Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Agere Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 2.7_
(after aggregating all fractional shares of LSI Common Stock that otherwise
would be received by such holder of record) shall, upon the surrender of the
certificate, if any, representing such share of Agere Common Stock in the
manner provided in _Section 2.8_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required)
in the manner provided in _Section 2.10_), receive from LSI an amount of
cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of LSI
Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

        



  |  

(d)

  |  

_Agere Stock Awards_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(i) At the Effective Time, each Agere Stock Award that is a stock
option to purchase shares of Agere Common Stock (each a " _Agere Stock Option_
") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
then vested or exercisable (each, an " _Assumed Option_ "), shall be assumed
by LSI. Each Assumed Option shall be converted into an option to acquire that
number of shares of LSI Common Stock equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of shares of Agere Common Stock subject to such
Agere Stock Option and (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
share of LSI Common Stock. Each Assumed Option shall have a exercise price
per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the per share
exercise price of Agere Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option by (y) the
Exchange Ratio (which price per share shall be rounded up to the nearest one-
hundredth of one cent). Each Assumed Option shall otherwise be subject to the
same terms and conditions (including as to vesting and exercisability) as were
applicable under the respective Agere Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time. It is the intention of the parties that each Assumed Option
that qualified as a United States-based incentive stock option (as defined in
Section 422 of the Code) shall continue to so qualify, to the maximum extent
permissible, following the Effective Time. For employees of Agere or its
Subsidiaries located outside of the U.S., to the extent required to ensure
compliance with applicable local laws, LSI may require that outstanding
options be exercised only by a cashless exercise pursuant

  



  

16

  
   

to which employees will authorize a broker to sell all shares that they are
entitled to at exercise immediately upon exercise and receive the difference
between the market value of the shares at exercise and the exercise price in
cash.

  

(ii) If any shares of Agere Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time are unvested or subject to a repurchase option or
obligation, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with Agere or under
which Agere has any rights (the " _Agere Restricted Stock_ "), then the Common
Stock Consideration payable in exchange for such Agere Restricted Stock also
shall be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option or obligation,
risk of forfeiture or other condition and need not be paid until such time as
such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition lapses or
otherwise terminates, and the certificates representing such shares of
Agere Restricted Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends.
Prior to the Effective Time, Agere shall take all action that may be necessary
to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, LSI is entitled to exercise
any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted
stock purchase agreement or other agreement.

  

(iii) At the Effective Time, each Agere Restricted Stock Unit that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested or issuable (each, an " _Assumed Unit_ "), shall be assumed by LSI.
Each Assumed Unit shall be converted into an award to receive that number of
shares of LSI Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the number of shares of Agere Common Stock subject to such Assumed Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (x) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up,
if necessary, to the nearest whole share of LSI Common Stock. Each Assumed
Unit that was granted with a purchase price equal to Agere par value or with
no purchase price shall have a purchase price equal to LSI par value, which
LSI shall deem paid by virtue of past services rendered by the holder of such
Assumed Unit. Each Assumed Unit that was granted with a purchase price other
than Agere par value shall have a purchase price per share equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (x) the per share purchase price of Agere Common
Stock subject to such Assumed Unit by (y) the Exchange Ratio (which price per
share shall be rounded down to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent). Each
Assumed Unit shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including as to vesting and issuance) as were applicable under the respective
Agere Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time; except
that with respect to any Restricted Stock Unit which vests upon a specified
date or dates if performance based criteria are achieved, achievement of such
criteria shall be waived and the Restricted Stock Unit shall vest otherwise in
accordance with its terms and conditions over the applicable period.

2.8

  |  

_Exchange of Certificates_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, LSI shall select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Agere to act as the exchange
agent for the Merger pursuant to an exchange agent agreement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Agere (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").

  

(b) _LSI to Provide Common Stock_. As promptly as practicable (and
in any event within two (2) Business Days) following the Effective Time, LSI
shall make available to the

  



  

17

  
   

Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_, the shares
of LSI Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ in exchange for
shares of Agere Common Stock. In addition, LSI shall make available from time
to time after the Effective Time as necessary, cash in an amount sufficient to
pay any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section
2.7(c)_ and any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of Agere
Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to _Section 2.8(d)_. Any LSI Common
Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

  

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time, LSI shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate or
certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Agere Common Stock (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated shares of Agere Common
Stock represented by book entry (" _Book Entry Shares_ ") (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form as Agere and LSI may reasonably agree (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
effective affidavits in lieu thereof) or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for certificates representing
whole shares of LSI Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_, cash payable
in respect thereof in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section
2.7(c)_ and any dividends or other distributions payable in respect thereof
pursuant to _Section 2.8(d)_. With respect to uncertificated shares of Agere
Common Stock held through "direct registration", LSI shall implement
procedures with the Exchange Agent for effecting the exchange of such directly
registered uncertificated shares of Agere Common Stock and payment of cash in
lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ , as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time. Upon surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavits in lieu thereof) or Book Entry Shares for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
LSI, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such
Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the number of whole shares of LSI Common Stock (after taking into
account all Certificates or such Book Entry Shares surrendered by such holder
of record) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_
(which, at the election of LSI, may be in uncertificated book entry form
unless a physical certificate is requested by the holder of record or
is otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements), payment in lieu of
fractional shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.7(c)_ and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.8(d)_, and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates or
Book Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as
the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares on
the cash amounts payable upon the surrender of such Certificates or such Book
Entry Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.8_. Until so surrendered, from and
after the Effective Time outstanding Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall
be deemed to evidence only the ownership of the number of full shares of LSI
Common Stock into which such shares of Agere Common Stock shall have been so
converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance
of any

  



  

18

  
   

fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.7(c)_ and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.8(d)_.

  

(d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared or made after the date hereof with
respect to LSI Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time, such
declaration shall include a dividend or other distribution in respect of all
shares of LSI Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends
or other distributions declared or made after the date hereof with respect to
LSI Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to
the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book Entry Shares with
respect to the shares of LSI Common Stock represented thereby until the
holders of record of such Certificates or such Book Entry Shares shall
surrender such Certificates or such Book Entry Shares. Subject to applicable
Legal Requirements, following surrender of any such Certificates or such Book
Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof,
without interest, promptly after such surrender, the number of whole shares of
LSI Common Stock issued in exchange therefor along with any such dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of LSI Common Stock.

  

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of
ownership of shares of Agere Common Stock is not registered in the stock
transfer books or ledger of Agere, or if shares of LSI Common Stock are to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in
exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificates so surrendered are properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting
such payment has paid to LSI (or any agent designated by LSI) any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of LSI Common Stock
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of LSI (or any agent
designated by LSI) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are
otherwise not payable.

  

(f) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent, LSI and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
applicable Legal Requirements. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted
or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

  

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, LSI, the Surviving
Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of
LSI Common Stock or Agere Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Legal Requirement.

  

(h) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book Entry
Shares twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall, at the request of
the Surviving Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or
otherwise according to the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any

  



  

19

  
   

holders of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have not surrendered such
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in compliance with this _Section 2.8_ shall
after such delivery to Surviving Corporation look only to the Surviving
Corporation for delivery or payment of the shares of LSI Common Stock issuable
in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_ and
any dividends or other distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.8(d)_.

  

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Agere Common Stock_. From and
after the Effective Time, all shares of Agere Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares theretofore representing
any shares of Agere Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the shares of LSI Common Stock issuable
in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ and _Section 2.7(d)_ , cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.7(c)_ and any dividends or other distributions payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section 2.8(d)_. All shares of LSI Common Stock issued
upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Agere Common Stock in accordance
with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.7(c)_ and any dividends or other distributions paid in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section 2.8(d)_) shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Agere Common
Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Agere Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
then such Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article II_.

  

2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the shares of
LSI Common Stock issuable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ ,
the cash in lieu of fractional shares payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.7(c)_ and any dividends or distributions payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section 2.8(d)_; _provided, however_ , that LSI may, in
its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require
the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against LSI, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

2.11 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes or intent
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Agere and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of Agere and
Merger Sub shall have the authority to take all such lawful and necessary
action.

 **ARTICLE** III

  



  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF AGERE

  

Except (i) as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Agere to LSI
dated as of the date hereof (the " _Agere Disclosure Letter_ "), which
expressly identifies the Section (or, if applicable, subsection) to which such
exception relates (it being understood and hereby agreed that any disclosure
in the Agere Disclosure Letter relating to one Section or subsection shall
also apply to any other Sections and subsections if and to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure (without reference to
the underlying documents referenced therein) that such disclosure also relates
to such other Sections or subsections), or (ii) as set forth in any Agere SEC
Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof (other than in any "risk
factors" or other forward looking statements included therein), Agere hereby
represents and warrants to LSI and Merger Sub as follows:

  

3.1 _Organization and Qualification_. Agere is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
and has all requisite corporate power and authority necessary to own, lease
and operate the properties it purports to own, lease or operate and to carry
on its business as it is presently being conducted. Agere is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character or location of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except to the extent that the failure to
be so qualified or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an Agere Material Adverse
Effect.

  

3.2 _Subsidiaries_. A complete and accurate list of all of the
Subsidiaries of Agere, together with the jurisdiction of incorporation of each
Subsidiary and the percentage of each Subsidiarys outstanding capital stock
owned by Agere or another Subsidiary or affiliate of Agere, is set forth in
_Section 3.2_ of the Agere Disclosure Letter. Agere does not directly or
indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any
Person, excluding securities in any publicly traded company held for
investment by Agere and comprising less than one percent of the outstanding
stock of such company. Each Subsidiary of Agere is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Legal Requirements of its jurisdiction
of organization (to the extent such concepts exist in such jurisdictions) and
has all requisite corporate or other power and authority necessary to own,
lease and operate the properties it purports to own, lease or operate and to
carry on its business as it is presently being conducted, except to the extent
that the failure to be so organized or existing or in good standing or have
such power or authority would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, an Agere Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of
Agere is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business,
and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction (to the extent such concepts
exist in such jurisdictions) where the character or location of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except to the extent that the failure
to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an Agere Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

21

  
   



  

3.3 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. Agere has heretofore
made available to LSI a complete and accurate copy of the Agere Certificate of
Incorporation and Agere Bylaws. The Agere Certificate of Incorporation and
Agere Bylaws, and the charter and bylaws (or equivalent organizational
documents), each as amended to date, of each of its Subsidiaries (the " _Agere
Subsidiary Documents_ ") are in full force and effect, and neither the Agere
Board nor, to the knowledge of Agere, any Agere Stockholder has taken any
action to amend the Agere Certificate of Incorporation or the Agere Bylaws in
any respect. Agere has not taken any action in breach or violation of any of
the provisions of the Agere Certificate of Incorporation or the Agere Bylaws,
and each Subsidiary is not in breach or violation of any of the material
provisions of their respective Agere Subsidiary Documents, except, in the case
of a Subsidiary, as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, an Agere Material Adverse Effect.

maintains, adheres to and enforces a system of internal accounting controls
which are effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the

the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the material transactions and dispositions of the assets of Agere and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of Agere and its

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of Agere and its

on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand (such as any arrangement described in Section 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K

of Agere, any director, officer, auditor, accountant, consultant or

of Agere or any of its Subsidiaries in the terms and conditions of employment
because of any lawful act of such employee described in Section 806 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  

3.9 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as reflected in the Agere

in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii)
Liabilities under this Agreement or expressly permitted to be incurred under
this Agreement, and (iii) Liabilities that, individually and in the aggregate,

Agere Balance Sheet through the date hereof, Agere has conducted its business
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and, since
such date through the date hereof, there has not occurred (i) any Agere
Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any action taken by Agere or event that would
have required the consent of LSI pursuant to _Section 5.2_ had such action or

_Compliance with Laws; Permits_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) Agere and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with, and are not in
default under or violation of (and have not received any notice of material
non-compliance, default or violation with respect to) any Legal Requirement
applicable to Agere or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their
respective properties is bound, except for such non-compliance, defaults and
violations that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, an Agere Material Adverse Effect.

variances, exemptions, consents, certificates, authorizations, registrations,
orders and other approvals from Governmental Entities that are material to the
operation of the business of Agere and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole as
currently conducted (collectively, the " _Agere Permits_ "). The Agere Permits

and, to the knowledge of Agere, no suspension, revocation or cancellation
thereof has been threatened,

  



  

27

  
   

and there is no Legal Proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Agere,
threatened, seeking the suspension, revocation or cancellation of any Agere
Permits. No Agere Permit shall cease to be effective as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

3.12 _Legal Proceedings; Orders_. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an Agere Material Adverse
Effect, there are no material Legal Proceedings (other than arising from or
relating to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), (a) pending against Agere or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or assets, or (b) to the knowledge of Agere,
threatened against Agere or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective properties or assets. Neither Agere nor any Subsidiary of Agere is
subject to any outstanding Order that would reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. There has not been nor are there currently any internal
investigations or inquiries being conducted by Agere, the Agere Board (or any
committee thereof) or any third party at the request of any of the foregoing
concerning any financial, accounting, tax, conflict of interest, self-dealing,
fraudulent or deceptive conduct or other misfeasance or malfeasance issues.

defaults that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in

_Employee Benefit Matters_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) _Section 3.14(a)_ of the Agere Disclosure Letter sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all U.S. Agere Employee Plans. Neither Agere nor
any ERISA Affiliate has any plan or commitment to establish any new Agere
Employee Plan, to modify any Agere Employee

  



  

29

  
   

Plan (except to the extent required by law or to conform any such Agere
Employee Plan to the requirements of any applicable law, in each case as
previously disclosed to LSI in writing, or as required by this Agreement), or
to adopt or enter into any Agere Employee Plan.

(or a written summary of any unwritten plan) together with all amendments,
(ii) in the case of any plan for which Forms 5500 are required to be filed,
the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500) with schedules attached,
(iii) in the case of any plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code, the most recent determination, opinion, notification or

Employee Plan that is funded, (viii) all material correspondence to or from
any governmental agency relating to any Agere Employee Plan within the past

(c) Each Agere Employee Plan has been established, maintained and
administered in all material respects in accordance with all applicable Legal
Requirements, including if applicable, ERISA and the Code, and in accordance
with its terms, and each of Agere, Ageres Subsidiaries and their respective
ERISA Affiliates have in all material respects met their obligations with
respect to each Agere Employee Plan and have timely made (or timely will make)
all required contributions thereto.

  

(d) _Section 3.14(d)_ of the Agere Disclosure Letter contains a
complete and accurate list of each Agere Employee Benefit Plan that has assets
which include securities issued by Agere, any of Ageres Subsidiaries or any
of their respective ERISA Affiliates.

  

(e) All Agere Employee Plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, and all trusts that are intended to be qualified
under Section 501(a) of the Code (each, a " _Agere Qualified Plan"_ ), have
received determination, opinion or advisory letters from the Internal Revenue
Service to the effect that such Agere Employee Plans are qualified and the
plans and trusts related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under
Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, or Agere has remaining
a period of time under applicable U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations
or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements in which to apply for such a letter
and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination as
to the qualified status of each such Agere Qualified Plan. No such
determination, opinion or advisory letter has been revoked and, to the
knowledge of Agere, revocation has not been threatened, and no such Agere
Employee Plan has been amended or operated since the date of its most recent
determination letter or application therefor in any respect, and no act or
omission has occurred, that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
its qualification or materially increase its cost. There has been no
termination, partial termination or discontinuance of contributions to any
Agere Qualified Plan that resulted or may

  



  

30

  
   

reasonably be expected to result in material liability to Agere. No
"prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or
Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of
ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Agere Employee Plan.

  

(f) Neither Agere, any of Ageres Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has in the preceding six (6) years maintained,
participated in or contributed to (or been obligated to contribute to), or can
reasonably expect to have future material liability with respect to (i) a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (ii) a
"multiple employer plan" as defined in ERISA or the Code, or (iii) a "funded
welfare plan" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code. No Agere Employee
Plan is funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary employees
beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.
No Agere Employee Plan provides health benefits that are not fully insured
through an insurance contract.

  

(g) The Pension Plans set forth in _Section 3.14(g)_ of the Agere
Disclosure Letter are the only Pension Plans that Agere or any Agere ERISA
Affiliate has maintained, sponsored, participated or contributed to in the
preceding six (6) years, or currently maintains, sponsors, participates in or
contributes to, or can reasonably expect to have future material liability
with respect to, that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code (each, an " _Agere Pension Plan_ "). As of the Effective Time: (i) no
legal or administrative action has been taken by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ") to terminate or to appoint a trustee to
administer any Agere Pension Plan; (ii) no liability to the PBGC under Title
IV of ERISA has been incurred by Agere or an Agere ERISA Affiliate that has
not been satisfied in full; (iii) no Agere Pension Plan has a reportable event
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30 day notice
requirement has not been waived by the PBGC has occurred within the past six
years or is reasonably expected to occur with respect to any Agere Employee
Plan; and (iv) no Agere Pension Plan has incurred any event described in
Section 4041, 4062 or 4063 of ERISA. No complete or partial termination of any
Agere Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA has occurred or is expected
to occur and no proceedings have been instituted and, to the knowledge of
Agere, no condition exists and no event has occurred that is reasonably likely
to constitute grounds under Title IV of ERISA to terminate or appoint a
trustee to administer any Agere Pension Plan. Each Agere Pension Plan has
been maintained in compliance with the minimum funding standards of ERISA and
the Code where applicable and no Agere Pension Plan subject to §412 or 418B of
the Code or §302 of ERISA has incurred any accumulated funding deficiency
within the meaning of §412 or 418B of the Code or §302 of ERISA, respectively,
or has applied for or obtained a waiver from the IRS of any minimum funding
requirement or an extension of any amortization period under §412 of the Code
or §303 or 304 of ERISA. Except for payments of premiums to the PBGC, which
have been paid in full, Agere has not incurred any liability (including any
indirect liability through an agreement with any other party and any material
contingent or material secondary liability) to the PBGC in connection with any
Agere Pension Plan covering any active, retired or former employees or
directors of Agere, including any liability under §4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA or
any penalty imposed under §4071 of ERISA, or ceased operations at any
facility or withdrawn from any such Agere Pension Plan in a manner which could
subject it to liability under §4062, 4063 or 4064 of ERISA, or knows of any
facts or circumstances that might give rise to any liability of Agere to the
PBGC under Title IV of ERISA that could reasonably be anticipated to result in
any claims

the Agere Disclosure Letter sets forth the approximate liability for any Agere
Pension Plan accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of §412 or 418B
of the Code or §302 of ERISA.

  

(h) Other than as required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA or
equivalent state law, none of the Agere Employee Plans promises or provides
health or other welfare benefits (excluding normal claims for benefits under
Ageres group life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and
disability plans and policies) or coverage to any person following retirement
or other termination of employment.

  

(i) There is no action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration, audit
or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Agere, threatened or
reasonably anticipated, with respect to any Agere Employee Plan or the assets
of any Agere Employee Benefit Plan, other than claims for benefits in the
ordinary course. No Agere Employee Plan is or within the last three calendar
years has been the subject of, or has received notice that it is the subject
of, examination by a government agency or a participant in a government
sponsored amnesty, voluntary compliance or similar program.

  

(j) To the knowledge of Agere, each individual who has received
compensation for the performance of services on behalf of Agere, any of
Ageres Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has been
properly classified as an employee or independent contractor in accordance
with applicable Legal Requirement.

  

(k) Each Agere Employee Plan maintained or covering employees outside
the United States (the " _Agere Non-U.S. Employee Plans_ "), and the books and
records thereof, is in material compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements of each applicable jurisdiction. No such Agere Non-U.S. Employee
Plan has unfunded liabilities, that as of the Effective Time, will not be

any of its Subsidiaries with or relating to its Section 16 officers, excluding
programs and policies required to be maintained by Legal Requirement.

Employee Plan on or prior to the Effective Time have been or will be timely
made or are reflected on Agere Balance Sheet.

  

(n) The negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event,
(i) entitle any current or former employee, director, consultant or officer of
Agere or any Subsidiary of Agere to

  



  

32

  
   

severance pay, or any other payment from Agere or any of its Subsidiaries, or
pursuant to any Agere Employee Plan, (ii) accelerate the time of distribution,
payment or vesting, a lapse of repurchase rights or increase the amount of
compensation or benefits due any such employee, director or officer, (iii)
result in the forgiveness of indebtedness, or (iv) trigger an obligation to
fund benefits. _Section 3.13(n)_ of the Agere Disclosure Letter contains a
complete and accurate list of each Agere "disqualified individual" (as defined
in Code Section 280G and the regulations thereunder). No payment or benefit
which will or may be made by Agere or its ERISA Affiliates with respect to any
current or former employee or any other "disqualified individual" is
reasonably expected to be characterized as a "parachute payment," within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. There is no contract, agreement,
plan or arrangement to which Agere or any ERISA Affiliates is a party or by
which it is bound to compensate any current or former employee or other
disqualified individual for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the
Code.

  

(o) Each material nonqualified deferred compensation plan (as defined
in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) maintained or sponsored by Agere has been
operated since January 1, 2005 in good faith compliance with Section 409A of
the Code and IRS Notice 2005-1. No material nonqualified deferred compensation
plan has been "materially modified" (within the meaning of IRS Notice 2005-1)
at any time after October 3, 2004.

  

(p) No stock option, stock appreciation right or service provider
warrant of Agere (i) has an exercise price that has been or may be less than
the fair market value of the underlying equity as of the date such option or
right was granted or (ii) has any feature for the deferral of compensation
other than the deferral of recognition of income until the later of exercise
or disposition of such option or right.

  

(q) Neither Agere nor any ERISA Affiliate has or is reasonably likely
to have any liability or obligations to Lucent or ATandT, with respect to any
compensation or benefits with respect to employees or former employees of
Lucent or ATandT who are not employees or former employees of Agere pursuant to
an agreement with Lucent or ATandT.

  

(r) There is no Contract to which Agere or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party, including the provisions of this Agreement, covering any employee,
consultant or director of Agere or any of its Subsidiaries, which,
individually or collectively, reasonably could be expected to give rise to the
payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G,
404 or 162(m) of the Code or that would give rise to a penalty under Section
409A of the Code.

(except for personal property sold since the date of the Agere Balance Sheet
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice). All
properties and assets reflected in the Agere Balance Sheet are free and clear
of all Liens, except for Liens reflected on the Agere Balance Sheet and Liens
for current taxes not yet due and other Liens that do not materially impair
the use of the property or assets subject thereto. All real property leases,
subleases, licenses or other occupancy agreements to which Agere or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party (collectively, the " _Agere Real Property Leases_
") are in full force and effect, except where the failure of such Agere Real
Property Leases to be in full force and effect would not be reasonably likely
to result in an Agere Material Adverse Effect. There is no default by Agere or
any of its Subsidiaries under any of the Agere Real Property Leases, or, to
the knowledge of Agere, defaults by any other party thereto, except such
defaults as have been waived in writing or cured or such defaults that in the

Adverse Effect.

(g) To the knowledge of Agere, no third party is misappropriating,
infringing, diluting or violating any Agere Intellectual Property Rights in a
manner that has or would reasonably be expected to have an Agere Material
Adverse Effect. There are no pending claims, suits, arbitrations or other

of Agere any other party to an Agere IP License, is in material breach of any

its Subsidiaries of any Agere IP License, (ii) the termination, impairment or
restriction of any right or license granted to Agere or any of its
Subsidiaries under an Agere IP License, or (iii) Agere or any of its
Subsidiaries to grant, or expand the scope of a prior grant, to a third party
of any rights

relates (it being understood and hereby agreed

  



  

38

  
   

that any disclosure in the LSI Disclosure Letter relating to one Section or

is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character or location of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except to the extent that the

individually or in the aggregate, an LSI Material Adverse Effect.

  

4.3 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. LSI has heretofore
made available to Agere a complete and accurate copy of the LSI Certificate of
Incorporation and LSI Bylaws. The LSI Certificate of Incorporation and LSI
Bylaws, and the charter and bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents),

LSI, any director, officer, auditor, accountant, consultant or representative
of LSI or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained

any lawful act of such employee described in Section 806 of the Sarbanes-

_Compliance with Laws; Permits_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) LSI and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with, and are not in

to the knowledge of LSI, no suspension, revocation or cancellation thereof has
been threatened, and there is no Legal Proceeding pending or, to the knowledge
of LSI, threatened, seeking the suspension, revocation or cancellation of any

  |  

_Employee Benefit Matters_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) _Section 4.14(a)_ of the LSI Disclosure Letter sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all U.S. LSI Employee Plans. Neither LSI nor any
ERISA Affiliate has any plan or commitment to establish any new LSI Employee
Plan, to modify any LSI Employee Plan (except to the extent required by law or
to conform any such LSI Employee Plan to the requirements of any applicable
law, in each case as previously disclosed to Agere in writing, or as required
by this Agreement), or to adopt or enter into any LSI Employee Plan.

  

(b) With respect to each LSI Employee Plan, LSI has made available to
Agere complete and accurate copies of (i) such LSI Employee Plan (or a written
summary of any unwritten plan) together with all amendments, (ii) in the case
of any plan for which Forms 5500 are required to be filed, the three most
recent annual reports (Form 5500) with schedules attached, (iii) in the case
of any plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code,

that is funded, (viii) all material correspondence to or from any governmental

Employee Plan.

  

(c) Each LSI Employee Plan has been established, maintained and
administered in all material respects in accordance with all applicable Legal
Requirements,

  



  

47

  
   

including if applicable, ERISA and the Code, and in accordance with its terms,
and each of LSI, LSIs Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates have
in all material respects met their obligations with respect to each LSI
Employee Plan and have timely made (or timely will make) all required
contributions thereto.

  

(d) _Section 4.14(d)_ of the LSI Disclosure Letter contains a
complete and accurate list of each LSI Employee Benefit Plan that has assets
which include securities issued by LSI, any of LSIs Subsidiaries or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates.

  

(e) All LSI Employee Plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, and all trusts that are intended to be qualified
under Section 501(a) of the Code (each, a " _LSI Qualified Plan"_ ), have
received determination, opinion or advisory letters from the Internal Revenue
Service to the effect that such LSI Employee Plans are qualified and the plans
and trusts related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, or LSI has remaining a period of
time under applicable U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations or Internal
Revenue Service pronouncements in which to apply for such a letter and to make
any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination as to the
qualified status of each such LSI Qualified Plan. No such determination,
opinion or advisory letter has been revoked and, to the knowledge of LSI,
revocation has not been threatened, and no such LSI Employee Plan has been
amended or operated since the date of its most recent determination letter or
application therefor in any respect, and no act or omission has occurred, that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect its qualification or
materially increase its cost. There has been no termination, partial
termination or discontinuance of contributions to any LSI Qualified Plan that
resulted or may reasonably be expected to result in material liability to LSI.
No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or
Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of
ERISA, has occurred with respect to any LSI Employee Plan.

  

(f) Neither LSI, any of LSIs Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has in the past six (6) years maintained,
participated in or contributed to (or been obligated to contribute to) or can
reasonably be expected to have future material liability with respect to (i)
a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (ii) a
"multiple employer plan" as defined in ERISA or the Code, or (iii) a "funded
welfare plan" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code. No LSI Employee
Plan is funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary employees
beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.
No LSI Employee Plan provides health benefits that are not fully insured
through an insurance contract.

  

(g) The Pension Plans set forth in _Section 4.14(g)_ of the LSI
Disclosure Letter are the only Pension Plans that LSI or any LSI ERISA
Affiliate has maintained, sponsored, participated or contributed to in the
preceding six (6) years, or currently maintains, sponsors, participates in or
contributes to, or can reasonably be expected to have future material
liability with respect to, that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code (each, an " _LSI Pension Plan_ "). As of the Effective Time: (i)
no legal or administrative action has been taken by the PBGC to terminate or
to appoint a trustee to administer any LSI Pension Plan; (ii) no liability to
the PBGC under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by LSI or an LSI ERISA
Affiliate that

  



  

48

  
   

has not been satisfied in full; (iii) no LSI Pension Plan has a reportable
event within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30 day notice
requirement has not been waived by the PBGC has occurred within the past six
years or is reasonably expected to occur with respect to any LSI Employee
Plan; and (iv) no LSI Pension Plan has incurred any event described in Section
4041, 4062 or 4063 of ERISA. No complete or partial termination of any LSI
Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA has occurred or is expected to
occur and no proceedings have been instituted and, to the knowledge of LSI, no
condition exists and no event has occurred that is reasonably likely to
constitute grounds under Title IV of ERISA to terminate or appoint a trustee
to administer any LSI Pension Plan. Each LSI Pension Plan has been maintained
in compliance with the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Code
where applicable and no LSI Pension Plan subject to §412 or 418B of the Code
or §302 of ERISA has incurred any accumulated funding deficiency within the
meaning of §412 or 418B of the Code or §302 of ERISA, respectively, or has
applied for or obtained a waiver from the IRS of any minimum funding
requirement or an extension of any amortization period under §412 of the Code
or §303 or 304 of ERISA. Except for payments of premiums to the PBGC, which
have been paid in full, LSI has not incurred any liability (including any
indirect liability through an agreement with any other party and any material
contingent or material secondary liability) to the PBGC in connection with any
LSI Pension Plan covering any active, retired or former employees or directors
of LSI, including any liability under §4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA or any penalty
imposed under §4071 of ERISA, or ceased operations at any facility or
withdrawn from any such LSI Pension Plan in a manner which could subject it
to liability under §4062, 4063 or 4064 of ERISA, or knows of any facts or
circumstances that might give rise to any liability of LSI to the PBGC under
Title IV of ERISA that could reasonably be anticipated to result in any PBGC
Claims being made against LSI. _Section 4.14(g)_ of the LSI Disclosure Letters
sets forth the approximate liability for any LSI Pension Plan accumulated
funding deficiency within the meaning of §412 or 418B of the Code or §302 of
ERISA.

  

(h) Other than as required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA or
equivalent state law, none of the LSI Employee Plans promises or provides
health or other welfare benefits (excluding normal claims for benefits under
LSIs group life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and
disability plans and policies) or coverage to any person following retirement
or other termination of employment.

  

(i) There is no action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration, audit
or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of LSI, threatened or reasonably
anticipated, with respect to any LSI Employee Plan or the assets of any LSI
Employee Benefit Plan, other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course.
No LSI Employee Plan is or within the last three calendar years has been the
subject of, or has received notice that it is the subject of, examination by a
government agency or a participant in a government sponsored amnesty,
voluntary compliance or similar program.

  

(j) To the knowledge of LSI, each individual who has received
compensation for the performance of services on behalf of LSI, any of LSIs
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has been properly
classified as an employee or independent contractor in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirement.

  



  

49

  
   



  

(k) Each LSI Employee Plan maintained or covering employees outside
the United States (the " _LSI Non-U.S. Employee Plans_ "), and the books and
records thereof, is in material compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements of each applicable jurisdiction. No such LSI Non-U.S. Employee
Plan has unfunded liabilities, that as of the Effective Time, will not be
offset by insurance or fully accrued. _Section 4.14(k)_ of the LSI Disclosure

by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event,
(i) entitle any current or former employee, director, consultant or officer of
LSI or any Subsidiary of LSI to severance pay, or any other payment from LSI
or any of its Subsidiaries, or pursuant to any LSI Employee Plan, (ii)
accelerate the time of distribution, payment or vesting, a lapse of repurchase
rights or increase the amount of compensation or benefits due any such
employee, director or officer, (iii) result in the forgiveness of
indebtedness, or (iv) trigger an obligation to fund benefits. _Section
4.14(n)_ of the LSI Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate list
of each LSI "disqualified individual" (as defined in Code Section 280G and the
regulations thereunder). No payment or benefit which will or may be made by
LSI or its ERISA Affiliates with respect to any current or former employee or
any other "disqualified individual" is reasonably expected to be characterized
as a "parachute payment," within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the
Code. There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which LSI or any
ERISA Affiliates is a party or by which it is bound to compensate any current
or former employee or other disqualified individual for excise taxes paid
pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.

  

(o) Each material nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained

of IRS Notice 2005-1) at any time after October 3, 2004.

  

(p) No stock option, stock appreciation right or service provider
warrant of LSI (i) has an exercise price that has been or may be less than the
fair market value of the underlying equity as of the date such option or right
was granted or (ii) has any feature for the

  



  

50

  
   

deferral of compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income
until the later of exercise or disposition of such option or right.

  

(q) There is no Contract to which LSI or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, including the provisions of this Agreement, covering any employee,
consultant or director of LSI or any of its Subsidiaries, which, individually
or collectively, reasonably could be expected to give rise to the payment of
any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G, 404 or
162(m) of the Code or that would give rise to a penalty under Section 409A of
the Code.

the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice). All properties
and assets reflected in the LSI Balance Sheet are free and clear of all Liens,
except for Liens reflected on the LSI Balance Sheet and Liens for current

property or assets subject thereto. All real property leases, subleases,

Subsidiaries is a party (collectively, the " _LSI Real Property Leases_ ") are

Leases to be in full force and effect would not be reasonably likely to result
in an LSI

Material Adverse Effect. There is no default by LSI or any of its Subsidiaries
under any of the LSI Real Property Leases, or, to the knowledge of LSI,

LSI or any of its Subsidiaries has been a "controlled corporation" or a

business infringes or will infringe upon, violate or constitute the
unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property Rights of any third Person, or
challenging the ownership, validity, enforceability, or registerability of any
LSI Intellectual Property Rights. LSI is not party to any settlements,

infringing, diluting or violating any LSI Intellectual Property Rights in a
manner that has or would reasonably be expected to have an LSI Material
Adverse Effect. There are no pending claims, suits, arbitrations or other

of LSI any other party to an LSI IP License, is in material breach of any such
LSI IP License that is material to the business of LSI and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will not result or cause (i) the breach by LSI or any of its Subsidiaries of
any LSI IP License, (ii) the termination, impairment or restriction of any
right or license granted to LSI or any of its Subsidiaries under an LSI IP
License, or (iii) LSI or any of its Subsidiaries to grant, or expand the scope
of a prior grant, to a third party of any rights to any material LSI
Intellectual Property Rights (including by release of any source code), except
as would not reasonably be expected to have an LSI Material Adverse Effect.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, LSI and Agere shall prepare, and LSI shall file with the SEC,

include (i) a prospectus for the issuance of shares of LSI Common Stock in the
Merger, (ii) a proxy statement of LSI for use in connection with the

supplemented from time to time, the " _Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ").
Each of LSI and Agere shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the

Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement shall be made without the
approval of LSI and Agere, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed; _provided_ that LSI, in connection with an LSI Board
Recommendation Change, and Agere, in connection with an Agere Board
Recommendation Change, may amend or supplement the proxy statement for LSI,
the proxy statement for Agere or the Registration Statement (including by
incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment to effect such
change, and in such event, the right of approval set forth in this
_Section 6.4(b)_ shall apply only with respect to such information relating
to the other party or its business, financial condition or results of
operations, and shall be subject to the right of each party to have its Board
of Directors deliberations and conclusions be accurately described. A "
_Qualifying Amendment_ " means an amendment or supplement to the proxy
statement for LSI, the proxy statement for Agere or the Registration Statement
(including by incorporation by reference) to the extent it contains (i) an LSI
Board Recommendation Change or an Agere Board Recommendation Change (as the
case may be), (ii) a statement of the reasons of the Board of Directors of LSI
or Agere (as the case may be) for making such LSI Board Recommendation Change
or Agere Board Recommendation Change (as the case may be) and (iii) additional
information reasonably related to the foregoing.

  

(c) The Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
shall comply in all material respects as to form and substance with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the information supplied or to be supplied by
either party hereto for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Registration Statement shall not, at the time the Registration Statement is
filed with the SEC or declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The information supplied or to be supplied by either
party hereto for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall not, on the date the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first
mailed to stockholders, at the time of each of the Merger Stockholder
Meetings, or as of the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information
supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of either party hereto for
inclusion in any filing pursuant to Rule 165 and Rule 425 under the Securities
Act or Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (each, a " _Regulation M-A
Filing_") shall not, at the time any such Regulation M-A Filing is filed with
the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior
to the Effective Time (i) Agere and LSI shall notify each other as promptly as
practicable upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance which should be
described in an amendment of, or supplement to, the Registration Statement,
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing so that any such
document would not include any misstatement of material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and

  



  

66

  
   

as promptly as practicable thereafter, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by applicable Legal Requirements or the SEC, disseminated to
the stockholders of Agere and/or LSI. Agere and LSI shall each notify the
other as promptly as practicable after the receipt by it of any written or
oral comments of the SEC or its staff on, or of any written or oral request by
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to, the Registration
Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing,
and shall promptly supply the other with copies of all correspondence between
it or any of its representatives and the SEC or its staff with respect to any
of the foregoing filings.

in which LSI and Agere mutually agree to make such filing. Each of LSI and
Agere shall promptly (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making
of such filings, (ii) supply the other with any information that may be
required in order to effectuate such filings and (iii) supply any additional
information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ
or the competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and
that LSI and Agere reasonably deem necessary and/or appropriate. Each party
hereto shall (i) promptly inform the other party hereto of any communication
from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; (ii) if practicable, permit the other party the opportunity
to review in advance all the information relating to LSI and its Subsidiaries
or Agere and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and incorporate the other party\'s
reasonable comments; (iii) not participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation, or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger unless it
consults with the other party in advance, and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend; and
(iv) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondences, filings, and
written communications between them and their Subsidiaries and
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or its
respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger, except that any materials concerning valuation of the transaction or
internal financial information may be redacted. If any party hereto or
Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any such Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall use reasonable best
efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of LSI and
Agere may, as each deem advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 6.6
as "counsel only" and, in such event, such material and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and shall not be disclosed by such counsel to non-legal directors,
officers, employees or other advisors or representatives of the recipient
unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials or its legal counsel.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require LSI or Agere
or any Subsidiary thereof to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its
Affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property,
or the imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct
their business or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and
stock, in each case in a manner that would be reasonably expected to have a
material adverse effect on

  



  

69

  
   

business, operations, financial condition or results of operations of the
combined business of LSI and Agere after giving effect to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the

informed of such events.

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
neither LSI nor Agere nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to, or to disclose information, where such access

force and effect from and after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms.

  

6.8 _Public Announcements_. Each of LSI and Agere shall consult with
the other party hereto before issuing any press release or making any public
announcement or statement with

  



  

71

  
   

respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public announcement or
statement without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; _provided,
however,_ that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party
hereto, issue any such press release or make any such public announcement or
statement as may be required by Legal Requirement or the rules and regulations
of the NYSE if it first notifies and consults with the other party hereto
prior to issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement
or statement; and _provided further, however_ , that no such prior notice or
consultation shall be required in connection with any disclosure or other
action expressly permitted pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)_.

  

6.9 _Agere ESPP_. Prior to the Effective Time, Agere shall take all
necessary and appropriate actions so that all outstanding purchase rights
under the Agere ESPP shall automatically be exercised, in accordance with the
terms of the Agere ESPP, immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, Agere shall take all necessary and appropriate actions so that
the Agere ESPP shall terminate with such purchase, and no further purchase
rights shall be granted under the Agere ESPP.

  

6.10 _Agere Stock Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time, Agere shall
take all necessary and appropriate actions to allow for the treatment of Agere
Stock Awards in connection with the Merger as provided in _Section 2.7_ ,
including (i) obtaining any consents from, and delivering any notices to,
holders of Agere Stock Awards, (ii) amending the terms of its equity incentive

soon a practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than
five (5) days following the Effective Time, LSI shall file a registration
statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8, Form S-3 or another
appropriate form (and use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness thereof and maintain the current status of the prospectuses
contained therein) relating to shares of LSI Common Stock issuable with
respect to the Assumed Options, Assumed Units and the Common Stock
Consideration payable in exchange for Agere Restricted Stock, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to remain in
effect for so long as such Assumed Options or Assumed Units shall remain
outstanding.

  

6.12 _Agere 401(k) Plans_.(a) Prior to Closing, LSI and Agere
shall cooperate in good faith with respect to the appropriate treatment
following the Closing of any plans of Agere and its ERISA Affiliates intended
to include Code Section 401(k) arrangements (the " _Agere 401(k) Plans_ ") in
order to effectuate orderly transition in respect of such plans and minimize
any adverse effect on participating employees with respect to any such
transition.

  

(b) If, as a result of the determination arrived at by LSI in
accordance with _Section 6.12(a)_ , LSI provides written notice to Agere
requesting termination of one or more Agere 401(k) Plans prior to Closing,
then, effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the
Agere Board shall adopt a resolution effective immediately prior to Closing,

  



  

72

  
   

which resolution shall terminate any such Agere 401(k) Plan. Agere shall
provide LSI with evidence that such Atlas 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated
(effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to
resolutions of the Agere Board (any Agere 401(k) Plans so terminated, " _Agere
Terminating Plans_ "). As soon as administratively practicable following the
Effective Time, all participants in the Agere Terminating Plans shall become
participants in the comparable 401(k) arrangements of LSI and LSI shall
establish or designate a comparable 401(k) Plan arrangement of LSI to receive
any rollover distributions from such Agere Terminating Plans, including
rollover of any outstanding loans held by participants of such plans.

6.13

_Agere Employee Benefits_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) Except as may be required by collective bargaining agreements or
agreements with labor unions, trade unions, labor organizations or works
councils or Legal Requirements for a period of at least two (2) years
following the Effective Time, but in no event later than such time as an Agere
Employee (as defined below) ceases to be employed by or provide services to
Agere or its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, LSI shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each employee of Agere or its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the " _Agere Employees_ ") compensation
(in the aggregate), and health, welfare and pension benefits (but not
including equity awards) that are substantially equivalent, in the aggregate,
to those provided to such Agere Employees immediately prior to the date hereof
(that, with respect to benefits, were paid pursuant to written policies or
programs). Nothing herein requires or obligates LSI to offer or contribute LSI
securities or maintain an LSI stock fund under any 401(k) or pension plan
arrangement or retain any employees for any period of time beyond that
required by applicable employment, labor or works council agreements or by
applicable Legal Requirements.

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, and to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, LSI shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, recognize the prior service with Agere or its Subsidiaries of
each Agere Employee in connection with all employee benefit plans, programs or
policies (including vacation and severance, but excluding the sabbatical
program) of LSI or its Affiliates in which Agere Employees are eligible to
participate following the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and
vesting and determination of level of benefits (but not for purposes of
benefit accruals or benefit amounts under any defined benefit pension plan or
to the extent that such recognition would result in duplication of benefits).
From and after the Effective Time, LSI shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and
eligibility waiting periods (to the extent that such waiting periods would be
inapplicable, taking into account service with Agere) under any group health
plans of LSI or its affiliates to be waived with respect to Agere Employees
and their eligible dependents, and (ii) provide each Agere Employee with
credit for any deductibles paid under any Agere Employee Plan that provides
medical, dental or vision benefits in the plan year in effect as of the
Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out of pocket
requirements under any medical, dental or vision plans of LSI or the Surviving
Corporation that such employees are eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time to the same extent that such expenses were recognized under the
comparable Agere Employee Plan.

  



  

73

  
   



  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.13(a) and (b)_ are not
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, and nothing herein shall be deemed to amend any Employee
Benefit Plan to reflect the terms of this _Section 6.13(a) and (b)_.

  

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the
Effective Time, LSI shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor
in accordance with their terms all employment, change in control, severance
and other compensation and benefits agreements and arrangements existing prior
to the execution of this Agreement which are between Agere or any of its
Subsidiaries and any director, officer or employee thereof and set forth in
_Section 6.13_ of the Agere Disclosure Letter (each an " _Agere Executive
Agreement_ "), and to refrain from amending or terminating any such agreement
or arrangement for a period of at least two (2) years following the Effective
Date, except such amendments as may be necessary to avoid the imposition of a
tax under Section 409A of the Code; provided that, nothing herein shall
prevent LSI from amending any such agreement or plan thereafter in accordance
with its terms. LSI hereby agrees that the occurrence of the Closing shall
constitute a "Change in Control" for purposes of any Agere Executive Agreement
and all Agere Employee Plans and related trusts set forth in _Section 6.13_
of the Agere Disclosure Letter.

6.14

_Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) After the Effective Time, LSI shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who on
or prior to the Effective Time were officers, directors and employees of Agere
or its Subsidiaries or were serving at the request of Agere as an officer,
director or employee of any other corporation, partnership or joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise with respect to all acts or
omission by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request of Agere
or any of its Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Effective Time to the
fullest extent permitted by law (including with respect to advancement of
expenses).

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, LSI
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
maintain in effect, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of Agere
and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time between Agere or any of its
Subsidiaries and any of its current or former directors and officers and any
person who becomes a director or officer of Agere or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") and shall not
amend, terminate or otherwise modify any such agreements. In addition, for a
period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, LSI shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, cause the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational
documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation that are at least
as favorable as the indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational
documents) of Agere and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any respect, except as required by Legal
Requirement.

  



  

74

  
   



  

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, LSI
and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the
existing policy of Ageres directors and officers liability insurance (the "
_D andO Policy_") covering claims arising from facts or events that occurred at
or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby to the extent that such acts or omissions are covered by
the DandO Policy) and covering each Indemnified Party who is covered as of the
Effective Time by the DandO Policy on terms with respect to coverage and amounts
that are no less favorable than those terms in effect on the date hereof;
_provided, however_ , that in no event shall LSI or the Surviving Corporation
be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 225% of the
current annual premium paid by Agere (which annual premium is set forth on
_Section 6.14(c)_ of the Agere Disclosure Letter) for such insurance (such
225% amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "); and _provided further,
however_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, LSI and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, in lieu of its obligations under the first
sentence of this  _Section 6.14(c)_ , LSI may purchase a six-year "tail"
prepaid policy on the DandO Policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous
than the DandO Policy, and in the event that LSI shall purchase such a "tail"
policy prior to the Effective Time, LSI and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor
their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of
LSI and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section
6.14(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force
and effect.

  

(d) The obligations under this _Section 6.14_ shall not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under
the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.14(c)_ (and
their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such
affected Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.14(c)_ (and their heirs
and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section 6.14(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.14_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy
referred to in _Section 6.14(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under
this _Section 6.14_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights that such persons may have under the certificate or articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and
all indemnification agreements of or entered into by Agere or any of its
Subsidiaries, or applicable Legal Requirement (whether at law or in equity).
LSI shall pay all reasonable expenses that may be incurred by the Indemnified
Parties in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
_Section 6.14_, provided that such Indemnified Party is successful in
enforcing any such claim.

  

(e) In the event that LSI, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns) shall
consolidate or merge with any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such

  



  

75

  
   

consolidation or merger, or transfers at least fifty percent (50%) of its
properties and assets to any other person, then in each case proper provision
shall be made so that the continuing or surviving corporation or entity (or
its successors or assigns, if applicable), or transferee of such assets, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.14_.

  

6.15 _Listing of LSI Shares_. LSI shall use its reasonable best efforts
to have authorized for listing on the NYSE prior to the Effective Time, upon
official notice of issuance, the shares of LSI Common Stock issuable in the
Merger pursuant to this Agreement, the shares of LSI Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of all Assumed Options and the shares of LSI Common Stock
issuable in respect of all Assumed Units.

  

6.16 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Agere and the Agere Board shall promptly grant such approvals and
take such lawful actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, as the case may be, and
otherwise take such lawful actions to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute, and any regulations promulgated thereunder, on such
transactions.

addition, the Agere Board, or a committee thereof consisting of non-employee

intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

Securities Act to deliver to LSI a written agreement substantially in the form
attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto (each, an " _Affiliate Agreement_ ") on or
prior to the Effective Time. LSI shall be entitled to place appropriate
legends on the certificates evidencing any shares of LSI Common Stock to be
received by Rule 145 "affiliates" of Agere in the Merger reflecting the
restrictions set forth in Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act and
to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for LSI
Common Stock, provided that such legends or stop transfer instructions shall
be removed upon the request of any holder of shares of LSI Common Stock issued
in the Merger if such holders shares are no longer subject to Rule 145.

  |  

_Tax Matters_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) None of LSI, Merger Sub or Agere shall, and they shall not permit

the Code.

parties hereto by action taken by their respective boards of directors at any
time prior to the Effective Time by execution of an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of LSI, Merger Sub and Agere; _provided, however_ ,

applicable Legal Requirements.

  

9.4 _Extension; Waiver_. __ At any time and from time to time prior

parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or
parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or
parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties,
as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of such right.

  

9.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Legal Requirement,
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an

  



  

88

  
   

acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

  

9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement)

understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

  

9.7 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, other than (i) the Indemnified Parties intended to be

consummation of the Merger, and (iii) the rights of directors, officers and
employees who are covered by an Agere Executive Agreement to pursue damages as

9.8 _Assignment_. __ This Agreement shall not be assigned by
operation of law or otherwise, except that LSI and Merger Sub may assign all
or any of their rights hereunder to any wholly owned subsidiary thereof;
_provided, however_ , that no such assignment pursuant to this Section 9.8
shall relieve LSI of its obligations hereunder.

  

9.9 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No
failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

the transactions contemplated hereby in any jurisdiction or courts other than

would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
