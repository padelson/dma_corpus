be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Transitory Subsidiary:

(a) _Capital Stock of the Transitory Subsidiary_. Each share of the common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock_. All shares of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ") that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of
Company Common Stock owned by the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or any
other wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Buyer immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of the Buyer or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2,
each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b), any shares of Company  



 

2  Common Stock that are owned by a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company,
which shall remain outstanding, and Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
2.5(a) below)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $55.00 in cash per
share, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective
Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) upon the surrender of
such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.

(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common
Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the Merger are as follows:

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall
deposit with a bank or trust company mutually acceptable to the Buyer and the
Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
for payment through the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2,
cash in an amount sufficient to make payment of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within five Business
Days) after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (each, a
" _Certificate_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
may be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this Section 2.2.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
evidencing shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the  



 

3  Buyer, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not
previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall be entitled to receive only
from the Buyer payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation
or the Buyer, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted
by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to the
applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by
such person of a bond in a customary amount against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(h) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement or by applicable law. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or the Buyer for any reason shall
be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c).

2.3 _Company Stock Plans_.

(a) Subject to Section 2.3(b), the Company shall take such action as shall be
required:

(i) to cause the vesting of any unvested options to purchase Company Common
Stock (" _Company Stock Options_ ") granted under any stock option plans or
other equity-related plans of the Company (the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") to
be accelerated in full effective immediately prior to the Effective Time;

(ii) to effectuate the cancellation, as of the Effective Time, of all Company
Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (without
regard to the exercise price of such Company Stock Options); and

(iii) to cause, pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, each outstanding Company
Stock Option to represent as of the Effective Time solely the right to
receive, in accordance with this Section 2.3, a lump sum cash payment in the
amount of the Option Consideration (as defined below), if any, with respect
to such Company Stock Option and to no longer represent the right to purchase

further force or effect without payment of any consideration in respect
thereof.

(c) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of Company Stock Options a

(a) As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Buyer and any
holder of an award of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to a Company
Stock Plan that is subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions ("
_Restricted Shares_ "), with respect to each such holders Restricted Shares,
each award of Restricted Shares which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall vest in full and become free of applicable lapse
restrictions as of the Effective Time and shall, as of the Effective Time, be
canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(c).

(b) As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Buyer and any
holder of an award of a right to shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to a
Company Stock Plan that is subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions ("

at the direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay such amounts.

2.5 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who is entitled to demand and
has made a demand for appraisal of such  



 

5  shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the MBCA and has not voted
in favor of the approval of this Agreement (any such shares being referred to
as " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under the MBCA with respect to
such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the MBCA to a holder of
Dissenting Shares.

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into

Certificates representing such shares.

for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to

constitute, or shall be considered in determining whether there has occurred,
a Company Material Adverse Effect (but, in the case of clauses (a), (b) and

effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries relative to other participants in
the industries or markets in which they operate):

circumstance or development causing or contributing to such decline may be
taken into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect
has occurred);

(h) a decline in the price of the Company Common Stock on The Nasdaq Global
Select Market (it being understood that any change, effect, event,
circumstance or development causing or contributing to such decline may be
taken into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect
has occurred);

(i) any shareholder litigation to the extent arising from or relating to the
Merger based on allegations that either the Companys entry into this
Agreement or the terms and conditions of this Agreement constituted a breach
of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board or that the disclosures in the

(ii) any material adverse change, effect, event, circumstance or development
with respect to, or any material adverse effect on, the ability of the
Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Subsidiary of the Company: (i) its name; (ii) the jurisdiction of
organization; and (iii) whether or not such Subsidiary is wholly-owned
(directly or indirectly) by the Company (and, if not wholly-owned, its
percentage ownership). For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Subsidiary_
" means, with respect to any party, any corporation, partnership, trust,
limited liability company or other non-corporate business enterprise in which

be conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as
a foreign corporation (to the extent such concepts are applicable) in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, operated or leased
or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except for
such failures to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, individually
or in the aggregate, that are not reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock and other equity securities or interests of each  



 

8  Subsidiary of the Company are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and all such shares (other
than directors qualifying shares in the case of non-U.S. Subsidiaries, all
of which the Company has the power to cause to be transferred for no or
nominal consideration to the Company or the Companys designee) are owned, of
record and beneficially, by the Company or another of its Subsidiaries free
and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements,

indirect equity participation or similar interest in any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other business
association or entity which is not a Subsidiary of the Company, other than
securities in a publicly-traded company held for investment by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and consisting of less than 5% of the outstanding
capital stock of such company.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to the approval of this Agreement (the " _Company

Company or of the charter, by-laws, or other organizational document of any
Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a

waiver under, constitute a change in control under, require the payment of a

that it was required to file, and all such Tax Returns were correct and
complete, except for any failure to file or errors or omissions that,
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have paid on
a timely basis all Taxes that are due and payable (whether or not shown to be
due on any such Tax Returns) other than Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for Tax periods through the date of the Company Balance Sheet
that do not exceed the accruals and reserves for Taxes set forth on the
Company Balance Sheet exclusive of any accruals and reserves for "deferred
taxes" or similar items that reflect timing differences between Tax and
financial accounting principles or Taxes which the failure to pay would not,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. All liabilities for Taxes that arose since the date of the Company
Balance Sheet arose in the ordinary course of business. All Taxes that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or was required by law to withhold
or collect have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent required,
have been paid to the proper Governmental Entity, except for any such Taxes

assessments or liabilities in the nature of a tax, including income, gross
receipts, ad valorem, premium, value-added, excise, real property, personal

America or any state, local or foreign government, or any agency thereof, or
other political subdivision of the United States or any such government, and
any interest, fines, penalties, assessments or additions to tax resulting
from, attributable to or incurred in connection with any tax or any contest
or dispute thereof and (ii) " _Tax Returns_ " means all reports, returns,

") or are closed by the applicable  



 

12  statute of limitations for all taxable years through the taxable year
specified in Section 3.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company
has made available to the Buyer correct and complete copies of all other
material Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries together with all
related examination reports and statements of deficiency for all periods from
and after January 1, 2003\. No examination, assessment, dispute, claim or
audit of any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any
Governmental Entity is currently in progress or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened or contemplated. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been informed in writing by any Governmental Entity that the
Governmental Entity believes that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was
required to file any Tax Return that was not filed. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations with respect to
Taxes or agreed to an extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency, other than waivers or extensions which are no longer in effect.

contract or otherwise.

zoning, subdivision, health, safety and other land use statutes, laws, codes,

Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections and paragraphs corresponding
to the numbered and lettered sections and paragraphs contained in this Article
IV and the  



 

19  disclosure in any Section or paragraph shall qualify (a) the corresponding
Section or paragraph in this Article IV and (b) the other sections and

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) The information to be supplied by or on behalf of the Buyer for inclusion

is first mailed to shareholders of the Company, at the time of the
Company Meeting or at the Effective Time, contain any statement which, at
such time and in light of the circumstances under which it shall be made, is
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in the Proxy
Statement not false or misleading; or omit to state any material fact
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect
to the solicitation of proxies for the Company Meeting which has become false
or misleading. If at any time prior to the Company Meeting any fact or event
relating to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates which should be set forth in a
supplement to the Proxy Statement should be discovered by the Buyer or should
occur, the Buyer shall, promptly after becoming aware thereof, inform the
Company of such fact or event.

this Agreement, has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted
its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement.

4.4 _Litigation_. There is no action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Buyer, threatened against
the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary that, individually or in the aggregate,
is reasonably likely to have an adverse affect on the ability of the Buyer or
the Transitory Subsidiary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

4.5 _Financing_.

(a) The Buyer has delivered to the Company complete and correct copies of (i)
a fully executed commitment letter from Wachovia Bank, National Association
(the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which such financial
institution has committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein for the purpose of
financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related fees and
expenses; and (ii) a fully executed commitment letter from Hellman and Friedman
Capital Partners VI, L.P., JMI Equity Fund V, L.P. and their
investment affiliates (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which
Hellman and Friedman Capital Partners VI, L.P., JMI Equity Fund V, L.P. and
their investment affiliates have committed, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth therein, to provide equity financing in the
aggregate amount of $752,900,000 in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity
Commitment Letter are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "
_Commitment Letters_."

(b) As of the date hereof, (i) Commitment Letters are in full force and
effect; (ii) all commitment fees required to be paid thereunder have been paid
in full or will be duly paid in full when due; and (iii) the Commitment
Letters have not been amended or terminated, and, excluding any breach caused
by the Company or its Subsidiaries, there is no breach existing thereunder. As
of the date hereof, the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary have no reason to
believe that the financing contemplated by each of the Commitment Letters
will not be consummated as contemplated therein.

(c) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth herein and compliance by the Company with its covenants and
obligations hereunder, neither the Buyer nor the Transitory Subsidiary is, as
of the date hereof, aware of any fact, occurrence or condition that makes any
of the assumptions or statements set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
inaccurate in any material respect or  



 

21  that would cause the commitments provided in such Commitment Letters to be
terminated or ineffective or any of the conditions contained therein not to
be met. For avoidance of doubt, it shall not be a condition to Closing for
the Buyer to have received the proceeds from the financings contemplated by
the Commitment Letters or any alternative financing.

(d) The equity investment by Hellman and Friedman Capital Partners VI, L.P., JMI
Equity Fund V, L.P. and their investment affiliates under the Equity
Commitment Letter is not subject to any condition other than as expressly set
forth therein.

(e) The aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letters would, upon
funding subject to the terms thereof, be sufficient to permit Buyer to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration and other repayment or refinancing of
debt contemplated by the Commitment Letters and to pay all related fees and
expenses.

4.6 _Management Arrangements_. The Buyer has provided the Company with true,
correct and complete copies of (a) all contracts and agreements, if any, and
(b) summaries of any arrangements or understandings, in each case in place as
of the date hereof between the Buyer and/or the Transitory Subsidiary (or any
of their Affiliates), on the one hand, and any of the officers and directors
of the Company (or any of its Affiliates), on the other hand, that would
become effective upon consummation of the Merger.

4.7 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. None of the Buyer or any of the
Buyers "Affiliates" or "Associates" directly or indirectly "owns," and at
all times during the three-year period prior to the date of this Agreement,
none of the Buyer or any of the Buyers "Affiliates" or "Associates" directly
or indirectly has "owned," beneficially or otherwise, any of the outstanding
Company Common Stock, as those terms are defined in Chapter 110F of the
Massachusetts General Laws, except for holdings from time to time that, at any
given time, have never been equal to or in excess of 5% of the outstanding
Company Common Stock.

4.8 _Guarantee_. The Guarantees are valid and in full force and effect and no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of each Guarantor under its respective
Guarantee.

described therein. The Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of the Company, take any
action or enter into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition,
joint venture, disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that
would reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent the Buyers obtaining
of the financing contemplated by any Commitment Letter. The Buyer shall not
amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, any Commitment Letter in any
manner that would reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent

24  the Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for at
least the same amount of financing as such Commitment Letter as
originally issued; provided that the Buyer shall be under no obligation to
obtain or seek to obtain any financing on terms and conditions less favorable,
in the aggregate, to the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary than those
included in the Debt Commitment Letter (as determined in the good faith
reasonable discretion of the Buyer).

(d) The Company agrees to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives to provide, the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary with
such cooperation (including with respect to timeliness) in connection with the
arrangement of the financings contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as
may be reasonably requested by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary,
including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions, due diligence
sessions, management presentation sessions, "road shows" and sessions with
rating agencies, (ii) furnishing the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and
their financing sources with financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer to
consummate the financings contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter,
including all financial statements and financial data required to consummate
the financing at the time during the Companys fiscal year such offering will
be made if such offering were registered under the Securities Act and of the
type and form customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A of
the Securities Act (the " _Required Financial Information_ ") (and shall allow
the Buyers Representative the opportunity to review and comment upon the
financial statements (including pro forma financial statements) in draft form
to the extent such financial statements were not prepared prior to the date
hereof), (iii) assisting the Buyer in preparing materials for rating agency
presentations, bank information memoranda, offering memoranda, private
placement memoranda and similar documents, (iv) providing and executing
documents as may reasonably be requested by the Buyer, (v) using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain surveys and title insurance as may be reasonably
requested by the Buyer, and (vi) reasonably facilitating the pledge of
collateral. The Company shall also use reasonable best efforts to cause legal
counsel to provide customary legal opinions and an independent auditor of the
Company to provide any unqualified opinions, consents or customary comfort
letters with respect to its financial statements. The Company shall allow
the Buyers Representatives the opportunity to review and comment upon any
such financial statements (including pro forma financial statements) in draft
form and to allow such Representatives access to the Company and supporting
documentation with respect to the preparation of such financial statements
and the independent auditors work papers relating to such financial
statements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) such requested cooperation
shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any
other liability in connection with the financings contemplated by the
Commitment Letters prior to the Effective Time. If this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall, promptly upon request
by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
such cooperation. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time,
the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall, on a joint and several basis,
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Representatives from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with the arrangement of the financings contemplated by the
Commitment Letters and any information utilized in connection therewith (other
than information relating to the Company provided by the Company for use
therein).

(e) Not less than three business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to the Buyer payoff letters from third-party lenders or
trustees, as applicable, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer, with respect to all indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries
identified on Section 5.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter or entered into
after the date hereof.

government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and
shall supply the Buyer with copies of all correspondence between the Company
or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or
any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all
documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory
authorities under this Section 6.2 to comply in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of law and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Buyer or the Company, as
the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of such occurrence and
cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any other government
officials, and/or mailing to shareholders of the Company, such amendment or
supplement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not file with the
SEC or mail to its shareholders the Proxy Statement, any amendment
thereto, any other soliciting material or any such other documents without
providing the Buyer a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
documents and shall include in such documents comments reasonably proposed by
the Buyer.

6.3 _Nasdaq Listing_. The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to continue the listing of the Company Common Stock on The
Nasdaq Global Select Market during the term of this Agreement.

6.4 _Access to Information_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company

reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and in
a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with business
operations, to all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel
and records as the Buyer shall reasonably request, and, during such period,
the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to the Buyer (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and (b) all
other information concerning its business, properties, assets and personnel as
the Buyer may reasonably request. The Buyer will hold any such information
that is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement. 

6.5 _Shareholders Meeting_. The Company, acting through the Company Board,
shall take all actions in accordance with applicable law (including Section
11.02(e) of the MBCA), its Articles of Organization and By-laws and the rules
of The Nasdaq Stock Market to promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold as promptly as reasonably practicable the Company Meeting for the
purpose of considering and voting upon the Company Voting Proposal. Subject to

not withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to withhold,
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Buyer, the recommendation of the
Company Board that  



 

28  the Companys shareholders vote in favor of the Company Voting Proposal.
Subject to Section 6.1, the Company shall take all action that is
both reasonable and lawful to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor
of the Company Voting Proposal and shall take all other action reasonably
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the shareholders of
the Company required by the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market or the MBCA to
obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with the Buyer, may adjourn or
postpone the Company Meeting if as of the time for which the Company Meeting
is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Meeting.

6.6 _Legal Requirements_.

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.1 and Section 6.6(b), the
Company and the Buyer shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to:

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable;

(ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain from any Governmental Entity or any
other third party any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, or orders required to be obtained or made by the Company or
the Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that in connection therewith,
without the prior written consent of the Buyer, none of the Company or its
Subsidiaries will make or agree to make any payment or accept any material
conditions or obligations, including amendments to existing conditions and
obligations;

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the

governmental request thereunder, and (C) any other applicable law; and

(iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

The Company and the Buyer shall cooperate with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings. The Company and the Buyer shall each use its
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules
and regulations of any applicable law (including all information required to
be included in the Proxy Statement) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer and the
Company agree that nothing contained in this Section 6.6(a) shall modify or
affect their respective rights and responsibilities under Section 6.6(b).

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, the Buyer and the Company agree, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearances or
approvals required for Closing under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended,
the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and
any other federal, state or foreign law, regulation or decree designed
to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively " _Antitrust Laws_ "), to
respond to any government requests for information under any Antitrust Law,
and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) (an " _Antitrust Order_ ") that restricts, prevents
or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. The parties hereto
will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the
views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in
 



 

29  advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any
Antitrust Law.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to take any
action under this Section if the United States Department of Justice or the
United States Federal Trade Commission authorizes its staff to seek a
preliminary injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation of the
Merger.

(d) Each of the Company and the Buyer shall give (or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any third party consents required in connection with the Merger that
are disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule
or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, it being understood that
neither the Company nor the Buyer shall be required to make
materially burdensome payments in connection with the fulfillment of its
obligations under this Section 6.6.

6.7 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by law or stock market
regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement
shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and the Buyer and (b) the Buyer and the Company shall each use
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before issuing
any other press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect
to the Merger or this Agreement.

6.8 _Indemnification_.

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ "), incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the MBCA for officers
and directors of Massachusetts corporations. Each Indemnified Party will be
entitled, subject to applicable law, to advancement of expenses incurred in
the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from
the Surviving Corporation within ten Business Days of receipt by the Surviving
Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that
any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to
the extent then required by the MBCA, to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. In
making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification
hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall
presume that each Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification and the
other benefits of this Section 6.8. Anyone seeking to overcome this
presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by
clear and convincing evidence.

(b) The Articles of Organization and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain, and the Buyer shall cause the Articles of
Organization and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain,
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Articles of
Organization and By-laws of the Company, which provisions shall not be
amended, modified or repealed for a period of six years time from
the Effective Time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
officers or directors of the Company.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain at no expense to the
beneficiaries, in effect for six years from the Effective Time
insurance "tail" or other insurance policies maintained by the Company with
 



 

30  respect to directors, officers and fiduciaries liability insurance with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in an amount and
scope at least as favorable as the coverage applicable to directors and
officers as of the date hereof under the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy; provided that if such "tail" or other policies are
not available at a cost not greater than 200% of the annual premiums paid as
of the date hereof under such policy (the " _Insurance Cap_ ") (which premium
the Company hereby represents and warrants is as set forth on Section 6.8(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule), then the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to obtain as much coverage as is possible under substantially
similar policies for such annual premiums as do not exceed the Insurance Cap.

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this
Section 6.8 in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in
this Section 6.8.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives.

(f) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or mergers into any other person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to the Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of
any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause
any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from
and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any
material failure of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary or the Company, as
the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section will not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or
the conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the Merger.

6.10  _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16_. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Common Stock) under such rule and result from the transactions contemplated by
Articles I and II of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company.

6.11 _Employee Compensation_. For a twelve month period following the
Effective Time, the Buyer will maintain the severance plan established by the
Company for its employees disclosed in Section 3.14(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and will use all commercially reasonable efforts to
provide generally to those of its employees and employees of the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries who shall have been employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
(" _Continuing Employees_ "), a total compensation package (including
benefits other than equity-based compensation) that, in the aggregate, is
substantially comparable to the total compensation package (including benefits
other than equity-based compensation) provided to those employees immediately
prior to the execution of this Agreement.

6.12 _Service Credit_. Following the Effective Time, the Buyer will give each
Continuing Employee full credit for prior service with the Company or its
Subsidiaries for purposes of (a) eligibility and vesting under any  



 

31  Buyer Employee Plans (as defined below), (b) determination of benefit levels
under any Buyer Employee Plan or policy relating to vacation or severance and
(c) determination of "retiree" status under any Buyer Employee Plan, in each
case for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the
Continuing Employee is offered participation, but except where such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, the Buyer
shall waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to
pre-existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under
any comparable plan of the Buyer and recognize for purposes of annual
deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans,
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Buyer Employee Plan_ " means any "employee pension
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), any "employee welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other written or
oral plan, agreement or arrangement, including insurance coverage, severance
benefits, disability benefits, deferred compensation, bonuses, stock options,
stock purchase, phantom stock, stock appreciation or other forms of incentive
compensation or post-retirement compensation and all unexpired severance
agreements, for the benefit of, or relating to, any current or former employee
of the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any entity which is a member of
(A) a controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the
Code), (B) a group of trades or businesses under common control (as defined in
Section 414(c) of the Code) or (C) an affiliated service group (as defined in
Section 414(m) of the Code or the regulations under Section 414(o) of the
Code), any of which includes the Buyer or a Subsidiary of the Buyer.

6.13 _Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain and deliver to the Buyer at the Closing evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer of the resignation, effective as of the
Effective Time, of those directors of the Company designated by the Buyer to
the Company in writing at least twenty calendar days prior to the Closing.

6.14 _Management Agreements_. The Buyer will not enter into any contracts or
agreements with any of the officers and directors of the Company unless such
contracts or agreements have been provided or made available to the Company
Board.

6.15 _Freely Available Cash_. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts,
subject to Section 5.1 above, at the Buyers request, to liquidate marketable
securities and to transfer such cash to the Company (from any Subsidiaries of
the Company) or into the Exchange Fund (to the extent such actions are not
inconsistent with applicable laws, including those related to solvency,
adequate surplus and similar capital adequacy tests). Before taking any such
action in accordance with such request, the Company shall disclose to the
Buyer the losses, costs, and expenses that the Company expects to incur in
connection with such action. To the extent action taken by the Company in
accordance with such request causes the Company to incur any losses, costs or
expenses (other than losses, costs or expenses resulting from wrongful acts
or omissions on the part of the Company), the Buyer shall reimburse such
losses, costs and expenses in the event the Closing does not occur. Except for
actions pursuant to this Section 6.15, the Company shall not (i) fail to
manage and retain cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable
securities in a manner substantially consistent with past practice and in
their current jurisdiction or (ii) intentionally fail to manage accounts
payable or accounts receivable in a manner substantially consistent with past
practice.

accountants and financial advisors, but excluding any discretionary fees paid
to such financial advisors), in the event of the termination of this
Agreement:

(i) by the Buyer or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) if the failure to

following any termination by the Buyer giving rise to the payment obligation
described in this Section 8.3(b).

(c) The Company shall pay the Buyer or its designee a termination fee of $55.0
million (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ") in the event of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), Section 8.1(f) or Section
8.1(j). The Company shall pay the Buyer or its designee the Company
Termination Fee in the event of any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(b), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(g) if, (x) prior to the date of
such termination (but after the date hereof), a bona fide Acquisition Proposal
is publicly announced or is otherwise communicated, made or proposed in
writing to the Company Board, and (y) within twelve (12) months after the date
of such termination the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or closes, any transaction of the type described in
the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" (except that all references to "20%"
in such definition shall be changed to "50%"). Any Company Termination Fee due
under the first sentence of this Section 8.3(c) shall be paid to the Buyer by
wire transfer of same-day funds concurrently (and as a condition to the
effectiveness of) any termination by the Company giving rise to the payment
obligation described in such sentence or within two Business Days following
any termination by the Buyer giving rise to the payment obligation described
in such sentence. Any Company Termination Fee due under the second sentence of
this Section 8.3(c) shall be paid to the Buyer by wire transfer of same-day
funds upon the closing of any alternative transaction.

(d) The Buyer shall pay the Company up to $5 million as reimbursement for
expenses of the Company actually incurred relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement prior to termination (including, but not
limited to, reasonable fees and expenses of the Companys counsel, accountants
and financial advisors, but excluding any discretionary fees paid to such
financial advisors), in the event of the termination of this Agreement:

(i) by the Company or the Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(b) if the failure to
satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) by the
Outside Date shall have resulted in the Closing not occurring; or

(ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h).

The expenses payable pursuant to this Section 8.3(d) shall be paid by wire
transfer of same-day funds concurrently (and as a condition to the
effectiveness of) any termination by the Buyer giving rise to the payment
obligation described in this Section 8.3(d) or within ten Business Days
following any termination by the Company giving rise to the payment obligation
described in this Section 8.3(d).

(e) The Buyer shall pay the Company a termination fee of $55.0 million (the "
_Buyer Termination Fee_ ") in the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(i); provided that, at the time of such termination,
all of the conditions under Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied.
Any Buyer Termination Fee due under this Section 8.3(e) shall be paid to the
Company by wire transfer of same-day  



 

36  funds within two Business Days after the date of termination of this
Agreement. If the Buyer Termination Fee is paid, and the Buyer and Transitory
Subsidiary are not otherwise in willful breach of this Agreement (other than
any such breach arising from the failure by the Buyer, after complying with
its obligations under Section 5.3 of this Agreement, to obtain the Debt
Financing), then the Companys termination of this Agreement and receipt of
payment of the Buyer Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
against the Buyer, Transitory Subsidiary, the Guarantors and any of their
respective Representatives, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
partners, managers, members, or stockholders (each, a " _Buyer Party_ ") for
any loss or damage suffered as a result of the breach of this Agreement or any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein by the Buyer
or Transitory Subsidiary or the failure of the Merger to be consummated or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (such losses or damages, collectively, " _Company Damages_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum
aggregate liability of all the Buyer Parties for all Company Damages shall be
limited to $137.0 million (the " _Buyer Liability Limitation_ ") (it being
understood that, for all purposes of determining whether the aggregate amount
of Company Damages paid by the Buyer Parties has reached the Buyer Liability
Limitation, the amount paid in respect of the Buyer Termination Fee or
expenses paid pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_ shall be included in such
computation as Company Damages paid). In no event shall the Company seek, and
the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries not to seek, any Company Damages or
any other recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against any Buyer Party in
excess of the Buyer Liability Limitation from any Buyer Party in connection
therewith and the Company, its Affiliates and its Subsidiaries shall be
precluded from any other remedy against any Buyer Party at law or in equity or
otherwise. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in all cases, the maximum liability of any Guarantor, directly or
indirectly, shall be limited to the express obligations of such Guarantor
under its Guarantee.

(f) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Payment of the fees and expenses described in this Section 8.3
shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of a willful breach of
this Agreement described in clause (a) of Section 8.2 but otherwise is the
sole and exclusive remedy of the parties in connection with any termination
of this Agreement or the circumstances giving rise to such termination.

8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the shareholders of any party, but, after any such approval,
no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such
shareholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party. Such extension or waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for
performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance
with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is
specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger
service, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice or other
communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it
actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any party to this
Agreement may change the address to which notices and other communications
hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to this Agreement
notice in the manner herein set forth.

9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be
delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties
to this Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements
or representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or
oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.

9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for (a) the rights of the holders
of Company Common Stock and Restricted Shares to receive the Merger
Consideration following the Effective Time in accordance with, and subject to,
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (b) the right of the holders of

and subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (c) the rights
of the Indemnified Parties and certain directors, officers and fiduciaries who

Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or
remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with
any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto.

9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the  



 

39  other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile transmission.

9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." No summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

9.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed by the Company in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed, that, without considering
the adequacy of any remedy that the Buyer may otherwise have to terminate this
Agreement under Section 8.1, the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The parties further acknowledge that the Company
shall not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement by Buyer or Transitory Subsidiary or to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that the Companys sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach shall be the Buyer
Termination Fee (if applicable) and, if applicable, the other remedies at law
available to the Company to the extent set forth in Section 8.3 (subject to
the Buyer Liability Limitation); provided, however, that the Company shall be
entitled to specific performance against the Buyer and Transitory Subsidiary
to prevent any breach by the Buyer or Transitory Subsidiary of Sections 5.2 or
6.4.

9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any state or
federal court sitting in Boston, Massachusetts in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c)
agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not
to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any
other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives
any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party
with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by
sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the
address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.2.
Nothing in this Section 9.11, however, shall affect the right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE BUYER, THE TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY AND
THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION,  



 

40  PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE BUYER, THE TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY OR
THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF
THIS AGREEMENT.

BY-LAWS

OF

SEAHAWK MERGER SUB CORPORATION



ARTICLE I

SHAREHOLDERS

_Section 1. Annual Meeting_. The Corporation shall hold an annual meeting of
shareholders at a time fixed by the Directors. The purposes for which the
annual meeting is to be held, in addition to those prescribed by the Articles
of Organization, shall be for electing directors and for such other purposes
as shall be specified in the notice for the meeting, and only business within
such purposes may be conducted at the meeting. In the event an annual meeting
is not held at the time fixed in accordance with these Bylaws or the time for
an annual meeting is not fixed in accordance with these Bylaws to be held
within 13 months after the last annual meeting was held, the Corporation
may designate a special meeting held thereafter as a special meeting in lieu
of the annual meeting, and the meeting shall have all of the effect of an
annual meeting.

_Section 2\. Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the shareholders may be
called by the President or by the Directors, and shall be called by the
Secretary, or in case of the death, absence, incapacity or refusal of the
Secretary, by another officer, if the holders of at least 10 per cent, or such
lesser percentage as the Articles of Organization permit, of all the votes
entitled to be cast on any issue to be considered at the proposed
special meeting sign, date, and deliver to the Secretary one or more written
demands for the meeting describing the purpose for which it is to be held.
Only business within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice
may be conducted at a special shareholders meeting.

_Section 3\. Place of Meetings_. All meetings of shareholders shall be held
at the principal office of the Corporation unless a different place is
specified in the notice of the meeting.

_Section 4\. Requirement of Notice_. A written notice of the date, time, and
place of each annual and special shareholders meeting describing the purposes
of the meeting shall be given to shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting
no fewer than seven nor more than 60 days before the meeting date. If an
annual or special meeting of shareholders is adjourned to a different date,
time or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time or place if the
new date, time or place, if any, is announced at the meeting before
adjournment. If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is fixed, however,
notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given under this section to persons
who are shareholders as of the new record date. All notices to
shareholders shall conform to the requirements of Article III.

 _Section 5\. Waiver of Notice_. A shareholder may waive any notice required
by law, the Articles of Organization, or these Bylaws before or after the
date and time stated in the notice. The waiver shall be in writing, be signed
by the shareholder entitled to the notice, and be delivered to the Corporation
for inclusion with the records of the meeting. A shareholders attendance at
a meeting: (a) waives objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the
meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to
holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting; and (b) waives
objection to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not
within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the
shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented.

_Section 6\. Quorum. _

(a) Unless otherwise provided by law, or in the Articles of Organization,
these Bylaws or a resolution of the Directors requiring satisfaction of a
greater quorum requirement for any voting group; a majority of the votes
entitled to be cast on the matter by a voting group constitutes a quorum of
that voting group for action on that matter. As used in these Bylaws, a voting
group includes all shares of one or more classes or series that, under the
Articles of Organization or the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, as in
effect from time to time (the "MBCA"), are entitled to vote and to be counted
together collectively on a matter at a meeting of shareholders.

(b) A share once represented for any purpose at a meeting is deemed present
for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any
adjournment of that meeting unless (1) the shareholder attends solely to
object to lack of notice, defective notice or the conduct of the meeting on
other grounds and does not vote the shares or otherwise consent that they are
to be deemed present, or (2) in the case of an adjournment, a new record date
is or shall be set for that adjourned meeting.

_Section 7\. Voting and Proxies._ Unless the Articles of Organization
provide otherwise, each outstanding share, regardless of class, is entitled to
one vote on each matter voted on at a shareholders meeting. A shareholder may
vote his or her shares in person or may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise
act for him or her by signing an appointment form, either personally or by his
or her attorney-in-fact. An appointment of a proxy is effective when received
by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes.
Unless otherwise provided in the appointment form, an appointment is valid for
a period of 11 months from the date the shareholder signed the form or, if it
is undated, from the date of its receipt by the officer or agent. An
appointment of a proxy is revocable by the shareholder unless the appointment
form conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is
coupled with an interest, as defined in the MBCA. An appointment made
irrevocable is revoked when the interest with which it is coupled is
extinguished. The death or incapacity of the shareholder appointing a proxy
shall not affect the right of the Corporation to accept the proxys authority
unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the secretary or
other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy exercises
his or her authority under the appointment. A transferee for value of shares
subject to an irrevocable appointment may revoke the appointment if he or she
did not know of its existence when he or she acquired the shares and the
existence of the irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on the
certificate representing the shares or on the information statement
for shares without certificates. Subject to the provisions of Section  



 

2  7.24 of the MBCA and to any express limitation on the proxys authority
appearing on the face of the appointment form, the Corporation is entitled
to accept the proxys vote or other action as that of the shareholder making
the appointment.

_Section 8\. Action at Meeting._ If a quorum of a voting group exists,
favorable action on a matter, other than the election of Directors, is taken
by a voting group if the votes cast within the group favoring the action
exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless a greater number of
affirmative votes is required by law, or the Articles of Organization, these
Bylaws or a resolution of the Board of Directors requiring receipt of a
greater affirmative vote of the shareholders, including more separate voting
groups. Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares
entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present. No
ballot shall be required for such election unless requested by a shareholder
present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election.

_Section 9\. Action without Meeting by Written Consent. _

(a) Action taken at a shareholders meeting may be taken without a meeting if
the action is taken either: (1) by all shareholders entitled to vote on the
action; or (2) to the extent permitted by the Articles of Organization, by
shareholders having not less than the minimum number of votes necessary to
take the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote on
the action are present and voting. The action shall be evidenced by one or
more written consents that describe the action taken, are signed by
shareholders having the requisite votes, bear the date of the signatures of
such shareholders, and are delivered to the Corporation for inclusion with
the records of meetings within 60 days of the earliest dated consent delivered
to the Corporation as required by this section. A consent signed under this
section has the effect of a vote at a meeting. 

(b) If action is to be taken pursuant to the consent of voting shareholders
without a meeting, the Corporation, at least seven days before the action
pursuant to the consent is taken, shall give notice, which complies in form
with the requirements of Article III, of the action (1) to nonvoting
shareholders in any case where such notice would be required by law if the
action were to be taken pursuant to a vote by voting shareholders at a
meeting, and (2) if the action is to be taken pursuant to the consent of less
than all the shareholders entitled to vote on the matter, to all shareholders
entitled to vote who did not consent to the action. The notice shall contain,
or be accompanied by, the same material that would have been required by law
to be sent to shareholders in or with the notice of a meeting at which the
action would have been submitted to the shareholders for approval.

_Section 10\. Record Date._ The Directors may fix the record date in order to
determine the shareholders entitled to notice of a shareholders meeting, to
demand a special meeting, to vote, or to take any other action. If a record
date for a specific action is not fixed by the Board of Directors, and is not
supplied by law, the record date shall be the close of business either on the
day before the first notice is sent to shareholders, or, if no notice is sent,
on the day before the meeting or, in the case of action without a meeting by
written consent, the date the first shareholder signs the consent. A record
date fixed under this section may not be more than 70 days before the meeting
or action requiring a determination of shareholders. A determination of
shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a shareholders meeting is
effective for any  



 

3  adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record
date, which it shall do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120
days after the date fixed for the original meeting.

_Section 11\. Meetings by Remote Communications_. Unless otherwise provided
in the Articles of Organization, if authorized by the Directors: any annual
or special meeting of shareholders need not be held at any place but may
instead be held solely by means of remote communication; and subject to such
guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, shareholders
and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of shareholders may, by
means of remote communications: (a) participate in a meeting of shareholders;
and (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of shareholders
whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of
remote communication, provided that: (1) the Corporation shall implement
reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted
to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a shareholder or
proxyholder; (2) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to
provide such shareholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the
shareholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the
meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and (3) if any
shareholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by
means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be
maintained by the Corporation.

_Section 12\. Form of Shareholder Action. _

(a) Any vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment or other action by a
shareholder or by the proxy or other agent of any shareholder shall be
considered given in writing, dated and signed, if, in lieu of any other means
permitted by law, it consists of an electronic transmission that sets forth or
is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine (i)
that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the shareholder, proxy or
agent or by a person authorized to act for the shareholder, proxy or agent;
and (ii) the date on which such shareholder, proxy, agent or authorized
person transmitted the electronic transmission. The date on which the
electronic transmission is transmitted shall be considered to be the date on
which it was signed. The electronic transmission shall be considered received
by the Corporation if it has been sent to any address specified by the
Corporation for the purpose or, if no address has been specified, to the
principal office of the Corporation, addressed to the Secretary or other
officer or agent having custody of the records of proceedings of shareholders.

(b) Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a vote, consent,
waiver, proxy appointment or other action by a shareholder or by the proxy or
other agent of any shareholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the
original writing for any purpose for which the original writing could be
used, but the copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing.

_Section 13\. Shareholders List for Meeting. _

(a) After fixing a record date for a shareholders meeting, the Corporation
shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its shareholders who
are entitled to notice of the meeting. The list shall be arranged by voting
group, and within each voting group by class or  



 

4  series of shares, and show the address of and number of shares held by each
shareholder, but need not include an electronic mail address or other
electronic contact information for any shareholder.

(b) The shareholders list shall be available for inspection by any
shareholder, beginning two business days after notice is given of the meeting
for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting: (1) at the
Corporations principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice
in the city where the meeting will be held; or (2) on a reasonably accessible
electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to
such list is provided with the notice of the meeting. If the meeting is to be
held solely by means of remote communication, the list shall be made
available on an electronic network.

(c) A shareholder, his or her agent, or attorney is entitled on written
demand to inspect and, subject to the requirements of Section 2(b) of Article
V of these Bylaws, to copy the list, during regular business hours and at his
or her expense, during the period it is available for inspection.

(d) The Corporation shall make the shareholders list available at the meeting,
and any shareholder or his or her agent or attorney is entitled to
inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.

ARTICLE II

DIRECTORS

_Section 1\. Powers._ All corporate power shall be exercised by or under the
authority of, and the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed
under the direction of, its Board of Directors.

_Section 2\. Number and Election_. The Board of Directors shall consist of
one or more individuals, with the number fixed by the shareholders at the
annual meeting, but, unless otherwise provided in the Articles of
Organization, if the Corporation has more than one shareholder, the number of
Directors shall not be less than three, except that whenever there shall be
only two shareholders, the number of Directors shall not be less than two.
Except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws or the Articles of Organization,
the number of Directors shall be fixed, and the Directors elected, by the
shareholders at the annual meeting.

_Section 3\. Vacancies_. If a vacancy occurs on the Board of Directors,
including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of Directors:
(a) the shareholders may fill the vacancy; (b) the Board of Directors may fill
the vacancy; or (c) if the Directors remaining in office constitute fewer than
a quorum of the Board, they may fill the vacancy by the affirmative vote of a
majority of all the Directors remaining in office. A vacancy that will occur
at a specific later date may be filled before the vacancy occurs but the new
Director may not take office until the vacancy occurs.

_Section 4\. Change in Size of the Board of Directors_. The number of
Directors may be fixed or changed from time to time by the shareholders, and
the Board of Directors may increase or decrease the number of Directors last
approved by the shareholders.



 

5 _Section 5\. Tenure_. The terms of all Directors shall expire at the next
annual shareholders meeting following their election. A decrease in the
number of Directors does not shorten an incumbent Directors term. The term of
a Director elected to fill a vacancy shall expire at the next shareholders
meeting at which Directors are elected. Despite the expiration of a
Directors term, he or she shall continue to serve until his or her successor
is elected and qualified or until there is a decrease in the number of
Directors.

_Section 6\. Resignation_. A Director may resign at any time by delivering
written notice of resignation to the Board of Directors, its chairman, or to
the Corporation. A resignation is effective when the notice is delivered
unless the notice specifies a later effective date.

_Section 7\. Removal_. The shareholders may remove one or more Directors with
or without cause. A Director may be removed for cause by the Directors by vote
of a majority of the Directors then in office. A Director may be removed by
the shareholders or the Directors only at a meeting called for the purpose of
removing him or her and the meeting notice must state that the purpose, or one
of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the Director.

_Section 8\. Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors
may be held at such times and places as shall from time to time be fixed by
the Board of Directors without notice of the date, time, place or purpose of
the meeting.

_Section 9\. Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of Directors
may be called by the President, by the Secretary, by any two Directors, or by
one Director in the event that there is only one Director.

_Section 10\. Notice_. Special meetings of the Board must be preceded by at
least two days notice of the date, time and place of the meeting. The notice
need not describe the purpose of the special meeting. All notices to directors
shall conform to the requirements of Article III.

_Section 11\. Waiver of Notice_. A Director may waive any notice before or
after the date and time of the meeting. The waiver shall be in writing, signed
by the Director entitled to the notice, or in the form of an electronic
transmission by the Director to the Corporation, and filed with the minutes or
corporate records. A Directors attendance at or participation in a meeting
waives any required notice to him or her of the meeting unless the Director
at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon his or her arrival, objects
to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not
thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.

_Section 12\. Quorum_. A quorum of the Board of Directors consists of a
majority of the Directors then in office, provided always that any number of
Directors (whether one or more and whether or not constituting a quorum)
constituting a majority of Directors present at any meeting or at any
adjourned meeting may make any reasonable adjournment thereof.

_Section 13\. Action at Meeting._ If a quorum is present when a vote is
taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of Directors present is the act of
the Board of Directors. A Director who is present at a meeting of the Board of
Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors when corporate action is
taken is considered to have assented to the action taken unless: (a) he
objects at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon his arrival, to
holding it or transacting business at the meeting; (b) his dissent or
abstention from the action taken is entered in the  



 

6  minutes of the meeting; or (c) he delivers written notice of his dissent or
abstention to the presiding officer of the meeting before its adjournment
or to the Corporation immediately after adjournment of the meeting. The right
of dissent or abstention is not available to a Director who votes in favor of
the action taken.

_Section 14\. Action Without Meeting_. Any action required or permitted to be
taken by the Directors may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken
by the unanimous consent of the members of the Board of Directors. The action
must be evidenced by one or more consents describing the action taken, in
writing, signed by each Director, or delivered to the Corporation by
electronic transmission, to the address specified by the Corporation for
the purpose or, if no address has been specified, to the principal office of
the Corporation, addressed to the Secretary or other officer or agent having
custody of the records of proceedings of Directors, and included in the
minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken.
Action taken under this section is effective when the last Director signs or
delivers the consent, unless the consent specifies a different effective date.
A consent signed or delivered under this section has the effect of a meeting
vote and may be described as such in any document.

_Section 15\. Telephone Conference Meetings_. The Board of Directors may
permit any or all Directors to participate in a regular or special meeting by,
or conduct the meeting through the use of, any means of communication by which
all Directors participating may simultaneously hear each other during the
meeting. A Director participating in a meeting by this means is considered to
be present in person at the meeting.

_Section 16\. Committees_. The Board of Directors may create one or more
committees and appoint members of the Board of Directors to serve on them.
Each committee may have one or more members, who serve at the pleasure of the
Board of Directors. The creation of a committee and appointment of members to
it must be approved by a majority of all the Directors in office when the
action is taken. Sections 11 through 15 of this Article shall apply to
committees and their members. To the extent specified by the Board of
Directors, each committee may exercise the authority of the Board of
Directors. A committee may not, however:

(a) authorize distributions; (b) approve or propose to shareholders action
that the MBCA requires be approved by shareholders; (c) change the number of
the Board of Directors, remove Directors from office or fill vacancies on
the Board of Directors; (d) amend the Articles of Organization; (e) adopt,
amend or repeal Bylaws; or (1) authorize or approve reacquisition of shares,
except according to a formula or method prescribed by the Board of Directors.
The creation of, delegation of authority to, or action by a committee does
not alone constitute compliance, by a Director with the standards of conduct
described in Section 18 of this Article.

_Section 17\. Compensation_. The Board of Directors may fix the compensation
of Directors.

_Section 18\. Standard of Conduct for Directors. _

(a) A Director shall discharge his or her duties as a Director, including his
or her duties as a member of a committee: (1) in good faith; (2) with the care
that a person in a like position would reasonably believe appropriate under
similar circumstances; and (3) in a manner the  



 

7  Director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation.
In determining what the Director reasonably believes to be in the best
interests of the Corporation, a Director may consider the interests of the
Corporations employees, suppliers, creditors and customers, the economy of
the state, the region and the nation, community and societal considerations,
and the long-term and short-term interests of the Corporation and its
shareholders, including the possibility that these interests may be best
served by the continued independence of the Corporation.

(b) In discharging his or her duties, a Director who does not have knowledge
that makes reliance unwarranted is entitled to rely on information, opinions,
reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial
data, if prepared or presented by: (1) one or more officers or employees of
the Corporation whom the Director reasonably believes to be reliable and
competent with respect to the information, opinions, reports or statements
presented; (2) legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons retained by
the Corporation, as to matters involving skills or expertise the Director
reasonably believes are matters (i) within the particular persons
professional or expert competence or (ii) as to which the particular person
merits confidence; or (3) a committee of the Board of Directors of which the
Director is not a member if the Director reasonably believes the committee
merits confidence.

(c) A Director is not liable for any action taken as a Director, or
any failure to take any action, if he or she performed the duties of his or
her office in compliance with this Section.

_Section 19. Conflict of Interest. _

(a) A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the Corporation
in which a Director of the Corporation has a material direct or indirect
interest. A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable by the
Corporation solely because of the Directors interest in the transaction if
any one of the following is true:

(1) the material facts of the transaction and the Directors interest were
disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board, of
Directors and the Board of Directors or committee authorized, approved, or
ratified the transaction;

(2) the material facts of the transaction and the Directors interest were
disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote and they authorized,
approved, or ratified the transaction; or

(3) the transaction was fair to the Corporation.

(b) For purposes of this section, and without limiting the interests that may
create conflict of interest transactions, a Director of the Corporation has an
indirect interest in a transaction if: (1) another entity in which he or she
has a material financial interest or in which he or she is a general partner
is a party to the transaction; or (2) another entry of which he or she is a
director, officer, or trustee or in which he or she holds another position is
a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(c) For purposes of clause (1) of subsection (a), a conflict of interest
transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors  



 

8  on the Board of Directors (or on the committee) who have no direct or
indirect interest in the transaction, but a transaction may not be
authorized, approved, or ratified under this Section by a single Director. If
a majority of the Directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the
transaction vote to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum is
present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of,
or a vote cast by, a Director with a direct or indirect interest in the
transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under clause (1)
of subsection (a) if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved, or
ratified as provided in that subsection.

(d) For purposes of clause (2) of subsection (a), a conflict of interest
transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the vote of a
majority of the shares entitled to be counted under this subsection. Shares
owned by or voted under the control of a Director who has a direct
or indirect interest in the transaction, and shares owned by or voted under
the control of an entity described in clause (1) of subsection (b), may not be
counted in a vote of shareholders to determine whether to authorize, approve,
or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under clause (2) of subsection
(a). The vote of those shares, however, is counted in determining whether the
transaction is approved under other sections of these Bylaws. A majority of
the shares, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote
on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose
of taking action under this Section.

_Section 20\. Loans to Directors_. The Corporation may not lend money to, or
guarantee the obligation of a Director of, the Corporation unless: (a) the
specific loan or guarantee is approved by a majority of the votes represented
by the outstanding voting shares of all classes, voting as a single voting
group, except the votes of shares owned by or voted under the control of the
benefited Director; or (b) the Corporations Board of Directors determines
that the loan or guarantee benefits the Corporation and either approves the
specific loan or guarantee or a general plan authorizing loans and guarantees.
The fact that a loan or guarantee is made in violation of this Section shall
not affect the borrowers liability on the loan.

ARTICLE VII

INDEMNIFICATION

_Section 1\. Definitions_. In this Article the following words shall have the
following meanings unless the context requires otherwise: 

"Corporation", includes any domestic or foreign predecessor entity of the
Corporation in a merger.

"Director" or "officer", an individual who is or was a Director or officer,
respectively, of the Corporation or who, while a Director or officer of the
Corporation, is or was serving at the Corporations request as a director,
officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another domestic or foreign
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan,
or other entity. A Director or officer is considered to be serving an
employee benefit plan at the Corporations request if his or her duties to the
Corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, him or
her to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan.
"Director" or "officer" includes, unless the context requires otherwise, the
estate or personal representative of a Director or officer.

"Disinterested Director", a Director who, at the time of a vote or selection
referred to in Section 4 of this Article, is not (i) a party to the
proceeding, or (ii) an individual having a familial, financial, professional,
or employment relationship with the Director whose indemnification or advance
for expenses is the subject of the decision being made, which
relationship would, in the circumstances, reasonably be expected to exert an
influence on the Directors judgment when voting on the decision being made.

"Expenses", includes counsel fees.



 

15 "Liability", the obligation to pay a judgment, settlement, penalty, fine
including an excise tax assessed with respect to an employee benefit plan, or
reasonable expenses incurred with respect to a proceeding.

"Party", an individual who was, is, or is threatened to be made, a defendant
or respondent in a proceeding.

"Proceeding", any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative, or
investigative and whether formal or informal.

_Section 2\. Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the Corporation shall
indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law an individual who is a party
to a proceeding because he or she is a Director or officer against liability
incurred in the proceeding if: (1) (i) he or she conducted himself or herself
in good faith; and (ii) he or she reasonably believed that his or her conduct
was in the best interests of the Corporation or that his or her conduct was at
least not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; and (iii) in the
case of any criminal proceeding, he or she had no reasonable cause to believe
his or her conduct was unlawful; or (2) he or she engaged in conduct for which
he or she shall not be liable under a provision of the Articles of
Organization authorized by Section 2.02(b)(4) of the MBCA or any successor
provision to such Section.

(b) A Directors or officers conduct with respect to an employee benefit
plan for a purpose he or she reasonably believed to be in the interests of the
participants in, and the beneficiaries of, the plan is conduct that satisfies
the requirement that his or her conduct was at least not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation.

(c) The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, is not, of
itself, determinative that the Director or officer did not meet the relevant
standard of conduct described in this Section.

(d) Unless ordered by a court, the Corporation may not indemnify a Director or
officer under this Section if his or her conduct did not satisfy
the standards set forth in subsection (a) or subsection (b).

_Section 3\. Advance for Expenses_. The Corporation shall, before final
disposition of a proceeding, advance funds to pay for or reimburse the
reasonable expenses incurred by a Director or officer who is a party to a
proceeding because he or she is a Director or officer if he or she delivers to
the Corporation: 

(a) a written affirmation of his or her good faith belief that he or she has
met the relevant standard of conduct described in Section 2 of this Article
or that the proceeding involves conduct for which liability has been
eliminated under a provision of the Articles of Organization as authorized by
Section 2.02(b)(4) of the MBCA; and

(b) his or her written undertaking to repay any funds advanced if he or she is
not wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of
such proceeding and it is ultimately  



 

16  determined pursuant to Section 4 of this Article or by a court of competent
jurisdiction that he or she has not met the relevant standard of
conduct described in Section 2 of this Article.

Such undertaking need not be secured and shall be accepted without reference
to the financial ability of the Director or officer to make repayment.

_Section 4\. Determination of Indemnification_. The determination of whether
a Director officer has met the relevant standard of conduct set forth in
Section 2 shall be made:

(a) if there are two or more disinterested Directors, by the Board of
Directors by a majority vote of all the disinterested Directors, a majority of
whom shall for such purpose constitute a quorum, or by a majority of the
members of a committee of two or more disinterested Directors appointed by
vote;

(b) by special legal counsel (1) selected in the manner prescribed in clause
(a); or (2) if there are fewer than two disinterested Directors, selected by
the Board of Directors, in which selection Directors who do not qualify as
disinterested Directors may participate; or

(c) by the shareholders, but shares owned by or voted under the control of a
Director who at the time does not qualify as a disinterested Director may not
be voted on the determination.

_Section 5\. Notification and Defense of claim; Settlements_.

(a) In addition to and without limiting the foregoing provisions of this
Article and except to the extent otherwise required by law, it shall be a
condition of the Corporations obligation to indemnify under Section 2 of
this Article (in addition. to any other condition provide in these Bylaws or
by law) that the person asserting, or proposing to assert, the right to be
indemnified, must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable
of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such person for
which indemnity will or could be sought, but the failure to so notify shall
not affect the Corporations objection to indemnify except to the extent the
Corporation is adversely affected thereby. With respect to any proceeding of
which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to
participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at
its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to such person.
After notice from the Corporation to such person of its election so to assume
such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to such person for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by such person in connection with
such action, suit, proceeding or investigation other than as provided below in
this subsection (a). Such person shall have the right to employ his or her own
counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the
Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense
of such person unless (1) the employment of counsel by such person has
been authorized by the Corporation, (2) counsel to such person shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or position on
any significant issue between the Corporation and such person in the conduct
of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation or (3) the
Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of
such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in each of which cases the
fees and expenses of counsel for such person shall be at the expense of the
Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Article. The
Corporation shall  



 

17  not be entitled, without the consent of such person, to assume the defense
of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which
counsel for such person shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided
for in clause (2) above.

(b) The Corporation shall not be required to indemnify such person under this
Article for any amounts paid in settlement of any proceeding unless authorized
in the same manner as the determination that indemnification is permissible
under Section 4 of this Article, except that if there are fewer than two
disinterested Directors, authorization of indemnification shall be made by the
Board of Directors, in which authorization Directors who do not qualify as
disinterested Directors may participate. The Corporation shall not settle any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner which would impose any
penalty or limitation on such person without such persons written consent.
Neither the Corporation nor such person will unreasonably withhold their
consent to any proposed settlement.

_Section 6\. Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of an individual who is a Director or officer of the Corporation,
or who, while a Director or officer of the Corporation, serves at the
Corporations request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or
agent of another domestic or foreign corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan, or other entity, against liability asserted
against or incurred by him or her in that capacity or arising from his or her
status as a Director or officer, whether or not the Corporation would have
power to indemnify or advance expenses to him or her against the same
liability under this Article.

_Section 7\. Application of this Article_.

(a) The Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify or advance
expenses to a Director or officer of a predecessor of the Corporation,
pertaining to conduct with respect to the predecessor, unless otherwise
specifically provided.

(b) This Article shall not limit the Corporations power to (1) pay or
reimburse expenses incurred by a Director or an officer in connection with his
or her appearance as a witness in a proceeding at a time when he or she is
not a party or (2) indemnify, advance expenses to or provide or maintain
insurance on behalf of an employee or agent.

(c) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article shall not be considered exclusive of any other
rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may
be entitled. 

(d) Each person who is or becomes a Director or officer of the Corporation
shall be deemed to have served or to have continued to serve in such capacity
in reliance upon the indemnity provided for in this Article. All rights to
indemnification under this Article shall be deemed to be provided by a
contract between the Corporation and the person who serves as a Director or
officer of the Corporation at any time while these By-laws and the relevant
provisions of the MBCA are in effect. Any repeal or modification thereof shall
not affect any rights or obligations then existing.



 

18 ARTICLE VIII

FISCAL YEAR

The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be the year ending with December 31
in each year. 

ARTICLE IX

AMENDMENTS

shareholders. If authorized by the Articles of Organization, the Board of
Directors may also make, amend or repeal these Bylaws in whole or in part,
except with respect to any provision thereof which by virtue of an express
provision in the MBCA, the Articles of Organization, or these
Bylaws, requires action by the shareholders.

(b) Not later than the time of giving notice of the meeting of shareholders

any By-Law, notice stating the substance of the action taken by the Board of
Directors shall be given to all shareholders entitled to vote on amending the
Bylaws. Any action taken by the Board of Directors with respect to the Bylaws
may be amended or repealed by the shareholders.

(c) Approval of an amendment to the Bylaws that changes or deletes a quorum

including additional voting groups, may not be adopted, amended or repealed
by the Board of Directors.

(e) A By-Law that fixes a greater or lesser quorum requirement for action by
the Board of Directors, or a greater voting requirement, than provided for by
the MBCA may be amended or repealed by the shareholders, or by the Board of
Directors if authorized pursuant to subsection (a). 

(f) If the Board of Directors is authorized to amend the Bylaws, approval by
the Board of Directors of an amendment to the Bylaws that changes or deletes
a quorum or voting requirement for action by the Board of Directors must
satisfy both the applicable quorum and voting requirements for action by the
Board of Directors with respect to amendment of the Bylaws, and also

19 ANNEX I

GUARANTEE

OF

GUARANTEE, dated as of March 22, 2007 (this "Guarantee"), by (the
"Guarantor"), in favor of Kronos Incorporated, a Massachusetts corporation
(the "Company").

1\. _GUARANTEE_. To induce the Company to enter into that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 22, 2007 (as amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"; capitalized
terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms
in the Merger Agreement), by and among the Company, Seahawk
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), and Seahawk Merger
Sub Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Buyer ("Transitory Subsidiary"), pursuant to which the Transitory Subsidiary
will merge with and into the Company, the Guarantor absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Company the due and punctual
observance, payment, performance and discharge of % (the "Guaranteed
Percentage") of any payment obligation of the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary pursuant to Section 5.3(d), Section 6.15, Section 8.3(d) or Section
8.3(e) of the Merger Agreement, in each case subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 8.3(e) of the Merger Agreement (the "Obligations"), provided
that in no event shall the Guarantors aggregate liability under this
Guarantee exceed $ _ _ (the " _Cap_ "), it being
understood that this Guarantee may not be enforced against the Guarantor
without giving effect to the Cap.

In furtherance of the foregoing the Guarantor acknowledges that the Company
may, in its sole discretion, bring and prosecute a separate action or actions
against the Guarantor for the full amount of the Guarantors Guaranteed
Percentage of the Obligations (subject to the Cap), regardless of whether
action is brought against the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or any other
guarantor pursuant to a Guarantee dated as of the date hereof to be entered
into between the Company and such other guarantor (the "Other Guarantor") or
whether the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or the Other Guarantor is joined
in any such action or actions.

2\. _NATURE OF GUARANTEE_. The Company shall not be obligated to file any
claim relating to the Obligations in the event that the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or
similar proceeding, and the failure of the Company to so file shall not affect
the Guarantors obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment to the
Company in respect of any Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned for any reason whatsoever, the Guarantor shall remain liable
hereunder with respect to its Guaranteed Percentage of such Obligations as if
such payment had not been made. This is an unconditional guarantee of payment
and not of collectibility. The Guarantor reserves the right to assert defenses
which the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary may have to payment of
any Obligations other than defenses arising from the bankruptcy or insolvency
of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary and other defenses expressly waived
hereby.

3\. _CHANGES IN OBLIGATIONS, CERTAIN WAIVERS_. The Guarantor agrees that the
Company may at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further
consent of the Guarantor, extend the time of payment of any of the
Obligations, and may also make any agreement with the Buyer or the Transitory
Subsidiary for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or
release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms
thereof or of any agreement between the Company and the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary or any such other person without in any way impairing or
affecting this Guarantee. The Guarantor agrees that the obligations of the
Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part,
or otherwise affected by (a) the failure of the Company to assert any claim or
demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Buyer or the Transitory
Subsidiary or any other entity or person interested in the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (b) any change in the time, place or
manner of payment of any of the Obligations or any rescission, waiver,
compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the
terms or provisions of the Merger Agreement or any other agreement evidencing,
securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Obligations; (c)
the addition, substitution or release of any other entity or person
interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (d) any
change in the corporate    existence, structure or ownership of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary
or any other entity or person interested in the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement; (e) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other
similar proceeding affecting the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary or any
other entity or person interested in the transactions contemplated in the
Merger Agreement; (f) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights
which the Guarantor may have at any time against the Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary or the Company, whether in connection with the Obligations or
otherwise; or (g) the adequacy of any other means the Company may have of
obtaining payment of the Obligations. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
the Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising
by reason of any law that would otherwise require any election of remedies by
the Company. The Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of the
acceptance of this Guarantee and of the Obligations, presentment, demand for
payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice
of any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind (except for
notices to be provided to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary in
accordance with Section 9.2 of the Merger Agreement), all defenses which may
be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other
similar law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling
of assets of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary or any other entity or
other person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, and all suretyship defenses generally (other than fraud or willful
misconduct by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or defenses to the
payment of the Obligations that are available to the Buyer or the Transitory
Subsidiary under the Merger Agreement or breach by the Company of this
Guarantee). The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct
and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Guarantee are knowingly made
in contemplation of such benefits. The Company hereby covenants and agrees
that it shall not institute, and shall cause its respective Affiliates not to
institute, any proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, or in
connection with, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby, against the Guarantor or any of any of the Guarantors former,
current or future directors, officers, agents, Affiliates (other than Buyer,
Transitory Subsidiary or Other Guarantor under its guarantee) or employees, or
against any of the former, current or future general or limited partners,
members, managers or stockholders of the Guarantor or any Affiliate
thereof (other than the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or the Other
Guarantor under its guarantee) or against any former, current or future
directors, officers, agents, Affiliates, general or limited partners, members,
managers or stockholders of any of the foregoing (other than the Buyer, the
Transitory Subsidiary or the Other Guarantor under its guarantee) (such
persons, not including the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or the Other
Guarantor, collectively, "Connected Persons") except for claims against
Guarantor under this Guarantee.

4\. _NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE RIGHTS_. No failure on the part of the Company
to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by
the Company of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or
future exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder. Each and every
right, remedy and power hereby granted to the Company or allowed it by law or
other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be
exercised by the Company at any time or from time to time.

5\. _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_. The Guarantor hereby represents and
warrants that:

(a) the execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee have been duly

or regulatory body is required in connection with the execution, delivery or
performance of this Guarantee;

(c) this Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Guarantor enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms,

creditors rights generally, and (ii) general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and

(d) Guarantor has the financial capacity to pay and perform its obligations
under this Guarantee, and all funds necessary for the Guarantor to fulfill its
Obligations under this Guarantee shall be available to the Guarantor for so
long as this Guarantee shall remain in effect in accordance with Section
8 hereof.

6\. _NO ASSIGNMENT_. Neither the Guarantor nor the Company may assign its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any other person (except by
operation of law) without the prior written consent of the Company or the
Guarantor, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Guarantor may
assign all or a portion of its obligations hereunder to an Affiliate or to
an entity managed or advised by an Affiliate of the Guarantor, provided that
no such assignment shall relieve the Guarantor of any liability or obligation
hereunder except to the extent actually performed or satisfied by the
assignee.

7\. _NOTICES_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed duly delivered (i) four (4) Business Days (as

8\. _CONTINUING GUARANTEE_. This Guarantee shall remain in full force and
effect and shall be binding on the Guarantor, its successors and assigns until
all of the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid or satisfied in full.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guarantee shall terminate and the
Guarantor shall have no further obligations under this Guarantee as of the
earlier of (a) the Effective Time, (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement
in accordance with its terms pursuant to any of Sections 8.1(a), (c), (d),
(e), (f), (g) or (j) (except for reimbursement of expenses under Section 6.15
or Section 8.3(a) and (d)) the first anniversary of any termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, except as to a claim for
payment of any Obligation presented by the Company to the Buyer, the
Transitory Subsidiary or the Guarantor by such first anniversary.

9\. _NO RECOURSE_. The Company by its acceptance of the benefits hereof,
covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no person other than the Guarantor
shall have any obligation hereunder and that no recourse hereunder or under
any documents or instruments delivered in connection herewith shall be had
against any of the Guarantors Connected Persons, whether by the enforcement
of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of
any statute, regulation or other applicable law. The Company acknowledges and
agrees that the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary have no assets and that no
funds are expected to be contributed to the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary
unless the Closing occurs. The Company further agrees that neither it nor any
of its Affiliates have any right of recovery against the Guarantor or any of
its Connected Persons, whether by piercing of the corporate veil, by a claim
on behalf of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary against the Guarantor or
the Buyers stockholders or Affiliates, or otherwise, except for the rights
under this Guarantee. Recourse against the Guarantor under this Guarantee
shall be the exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates against the
Guarantor and any of its Connected Persons in respect of any liabilities or
obligations arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby. The Company hereby covenants and agrees
that it shall not institute, and it shall cause its Affiliates not to
institute, any proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, or in
connection with, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby, against the Guarantor or any of its Connected Persons except for
claims  



 

3  against the Guarantor under this Guarantee. Except in accordance with
Section 6 hereof, nothing set forth in this Guarantee shall affect or be
construed to confer or give any person (other than the Guarantor and the
Company (including any person acting in a representative capacity)) any rights
or remedies against any person.

10\. _GOVERNING LAW_. This Guarantee shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of New York. Each

the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in New York,

affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law. 

11\. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE GUARANTOR AND THE COMPANY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR

12\. _COUNTERPARTS_. This Guarantee may be executed and delivered (including
by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different
