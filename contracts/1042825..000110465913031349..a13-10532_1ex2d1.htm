Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than

      
 

 



 

shares canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_) shall be converted into the
right to receive $4703.7037037 in cash (such sum, the " **Preferred Merger
Consideration** ", and together with the Common Merger Consideration, as
applicable, the " **Merger Consideration** "), without interest. For purposes
of this Agreement, " **Total Preferred Merger Consideration** " shall mean the
product of (x) the number of shares of Company Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding (other than shares canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_)
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Preferred Merger
Consideration, and " **Total Merger Consideration** " shall mean the sum of
the Total Common Merger Consideration and the Total Preferred Merger
Consideration. Each share of Company Preferred Stock to be converted into the
right to receive the Preferred Merger Consideration as provided in the first
sentence of this _Section 3.1(c)_ shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof, be automatically canceled and
shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates (the " **Preferred
Certificates** " and together with the Common Certificates, the "
**Certificates** ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
such Company Preferred Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Company Preferred Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender
of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with
_Section 3.4_) in accordance with _Section 3.2_, the Preferred Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, for each such share of Company
Preferred Stock held by them.

 



 

(d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value of $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) fully
paid share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(e) _Treatment of Company Warrants_. Each Company Warrant shall be, at the
Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Warrant Payment
payable in respect of such Company Warrant, without interest, and shall be
cancelled upon payment of the Warrant Payment therefor without any further
action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof. For purposes of this
Agreement, " **Warrant Payment** " means, with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock subject to the Company Warrants outstanding and
unexercised as of the Effective Time, a payment equal to the excess of the
Common Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock and " **Total Warrant Payment** " means the aggregate
Warrant Payments payable in respect of all Company Warrants.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Company Warrants_ _._

 



 

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate and enter into an agreement with a bank
or trust company, which bank or trust company and the agreement to be entered
into pursuant to this _Section 3.2(a)_ shall, in each case, be reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " **Paying Agent** "), it being agreed by the
parties that American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC is acceptable, for
the payment of the Merger Consideration and Warrant Payment as provided in
_Sections 3.1(b)_ , _3.1(c)_ and _3.1(e)_. Substantially concurrently with
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent (i) for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred

      
 

 



 

Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders
of shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ and, except as provided
in _Section 3.5_, the Dissenting Shares) cash constituting an amount equal to
the Total Merger Consideration and (ii) for the benefit of the holders of
Company Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time cash
constituting an amount equal to the Total Warrant Payment (such Total Merger
Consideration and Total Warrant Payment as deposited with the Paying Agent,
the " **Exchange Fund** "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Sections 3.1(b), 3.1(c)_
and _3.1(e)_ , Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the
Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common
Stock, Company Preferred Stock and Company Warrants, as applicable, and (ii)
applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to _Sections 3.1(b), 3.1(c)_
and _3.1(e)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than
to fund payments pursuant to _Section 3.1_. The Surviving Corporation shall
pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, incurred by
it in connection with the exchange of shares of Company Stock for the Merger
Consideration and the exchange of Company Warrants for the Warrant Payment and
other actions contemplated by this _Article III_.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the fourth (4th) Business Day thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected (and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates, as applicable, shall pass) only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and
which shall be in the form (including customary provisions with respect to
delivery of an "agents message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares) and have
such other provisions as Parent may, with the consent of the Company (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), reasonably specify and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) _Surrender Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. Upon the later of the Effective Time and surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor and Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to pay in exchange therefor as promptly as
practicable, the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article III_, and the Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the appropriate
amount of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying
Agent) and the Person requesting such payment shall pay, or cause to be paid,
any

      
 

 



 

transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Except with respect to Dissenting Shares, until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 3.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to _Sections
3.1(b)_ or _3.1(c)_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable
upon surrender of any Certificate.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this _Article III_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of
Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon the
Effective Time (or, at any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares shall be
so converted) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in
respect of each such Book-Entry Share, the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(iii) _Company Warrants_. The Company shall deliver a written notice to the
holders of Company Warrants no less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Merger Closing Date specifying the date on which the Merger Closing Date is
expected to occur and requesting surrender of all Company Warrants to the
Company on or prior to the Merger Closing Date. Upon receipt of such written
notice, each holder of Company Warrants shall use its reasonable best efforts
to surrender its Company Warrants to the Company on or prior to the Merger
Closing Date (it being understood that the failure of any holder of Company
Warrants to surrender its Company Warrants to the Company shall not delay or
impair such holders right to receive the Warrant Payment). Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to pay, as promptly as practicable on or following the Merger
Closing Date, to each holder of Company Warrants, the Warrant Payment payable
in respect of the Company Warrants held by such holder pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article III_, and such Company Warrants, upon payment of
the Warrant Payment therefor, shall be canceled without any further action on
the part of the Company or such holder and regardless of whether such Company
Warrants were surrendered to the Company. No interest shall be paid or accrue
on any cash payable upon surrender of Company Warrants.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains unclaimed by the applicable former stockholders of the Company or
holders of Company Warrants twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or Parent (as directed by Parent),
upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Parent or
the Surviving Corporation (as applicable) for payment of their claims for
Merger Consideration or Warrant Payment, as applicable, in respect thereof.

       
 

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash held in the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any
Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any holder of such
Certificate who has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with
respect thereto shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of its claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof (if any).

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that (i) no such investment
shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by
this _Article III_, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company
Stock and Company Warrants in the amount of such losses, (ii) no such
investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be
made pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in short-
term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more
than thirty days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Any interest or
income produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as directed by Parent.

 



 

(g) _Conversion of Series C Preferred Stock_. Within ten (10) Business Days
of Parents request, the Company shall send the Silver Lake Stockholders a
notice requesting the Silver Lake Stockholders to convert as soon as
reasonably practicable and in no event later than the record date for the
Stockholders Meeting, shares of Series C Preferred Stock into Company Common
Stock as contemplated by Section 10 of the Voting Agreement (the "
**Conversion** "). Such notice shall specify the procedures to be followed and
the regulatory approvals the Company reasonably determines will be necessary
(including under all applicable Antitrust Laws) to effect the Conversion. The
Company shall provide the Silver Lake Stockholders all reasonable cooperation
necessary to effect the Conversion.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Equity-Based Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Equity-Based Awards_

 



 

(i) _Rollover of Company Options_. Except to the extent otherwise elected by
the holder pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)(ii)_ hereof, as of the Effective Time,
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of the Company Options, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall (i) fully vest and become exercisable and (ii) be converted
into an option to acquire a number of Parent American Depositary Shares equal
to the product (rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares) of (A) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the

      
 

 



 

Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to (x) the exercise price per share of such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (y) the Option
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise price and the
number of Parent American Depositary Shares purchasable pursuant to the
Company Options (as converted) shall be subject to such adjustments as Parent
determines are reasonably necessary for the foregoing conversion to satisfy
the requirements of Sections 409A, 422 and 424 of the Code and Treasury
Regulation Section 1.424-1. Except as specifically provided herein, following
the Effective Time, each Company Option shall continue to be governed by the
same terms and conditions as set forth in the applicable Company Plan and any
agreements thereunder as were applicable immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 



 

(ii) _Elective Exercise of Company Options_. Notwithstanding _Section
3.3(a)(i)_, the Company shall, promptly following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event no later than thirty (30) Business Days prior to the Closing,
deliver written notice to each holder of a Company Option giving each such
holder the opportunity to make an irrevocable election in writing, no later
than seven (7) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, with respect to all
or a portion of such Company Option, whether vested or unvested, to the extent
such Company Option remains outstanding and unexercised immediately prior the
Effective Time, to exercise such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time and receive a payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation
following the Effective Time an amount in cash, in lieu of any rollover of
such Company Option pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)(i)_ no later than five (5)
Business Days following the Effective Time and conditioned upon the occurrence
thereof, equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such Company Option (or portion thereof) and (ii) the
Common Merger Consideration, reduced by the exercise price applicable to such
Company Option (or portion thereof), subject to any applicable income and
employment withholding Taxes; provided that if the exercise price per share of
any such Company Option (or portion thereof) is equal to or greater than the
per share Common Merger Consideration, such Company Option (or portion
thereof) shall be treated as provided in _Section 3.3(a)(i)_. Any holder of a
Company Option who makes an election under this _Section 3.3(a)(ii)_ shall
cease to have any rights with respect to the Company Option (or portion
thereof) for which an election is made and has become irrevocable, other than
to receive the payment specified in this _Section 3.3(a)(ii)_. Any Company
Option for which the election described in this _Section 3.3(a)(ii)_ is not
timely received shall be treated as provided in _Section 3.3(a)(i)_.

 



 

(iii) _Company Restricted Shares_. As of the Effective Time, each Company
Restricted Share granted prior to the date hereof and that is outstanding
shall become fully vested and all restrictions thereon shall lapse and be
converted automatically into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation, no later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective
Time, an amount in cash equal to the Common Merger Consideration, subject to
applicable income and employment withholding Taxes.

 



 

(iv) _Other Company Stock-Based Awards_. At the Effective Time, each other
Company Stock-Based Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
and, if applicable, unexercised immediately prior the Effective Time shall

      
 

 



 

become fully vested and shall be converted automatically into the right to
receive, no later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying such Company Stock-Based Award and (ii) the
Common Merger Consideration (reduced, if applicable, by any exercise price
applicable to such Company Stock-Based Award), subject to applicable income
and employment withholding Taxes; _provided_ , that with respect to any
unvested Company Stock-Based Award subject to performance-based vesting
conditions (" **Performance Awards** "), such Performance Awards shall be
deemed fully earned at a level that assumes the Company attained maximum
performance with respect to the applicable performance metrics to which such
Performance Awards are subject as of the Closing Date and shall fully vest
without any pro ration based on the extent to which the performance period
under the Performance Award has lapsed.

 



 

(v) The Company shall, in consultation with Parent, take any and all actions
reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 3.3_;
_provided_ , that Parent shall have the opportunity to review, for a period of
at least three (3) Business Days, and comment on any resolutions the Board or
any committee thereof intends to approve with respect thereto. Any notice the
Company intends to deliver to the holders of Company Options, or other Company
Stock-Based Awards or the participants in any other Company Plan setting forth
such holders or participants rights pursuant to this Agreement, shall be
subject to Parents opportunity to review, for a period of at least three (3)
Business Days, and consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

 



 

(vi) Parent shall, at or promptly following the Effective Time, deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Surviving Corporation sufficient cash funds to
make all payments owed pursuant to this _Section 3.3_, including payments in
respect of Company Options in which the holder has timely elected the "cashout
option," Company Restricted Shares and the Performance Awards, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make such payments after the
Effective Time to all holders of equity based awards in accordance with the
terms of this _Section 3.3_.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such customary and reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, and
who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " **Dissenting Shares** "), shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Common Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section_

      
 

 



 

 _3.1(b)_ , but instead the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive such consideration from the Surviving Corporation as shall
be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have otherwise waived, effectively
withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL
or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such shares shall no longer be
considered Dissenting Shares for purposes hereof and such holders shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Withholdings_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration,
the Warrant Payment and any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock,
Company Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Stock-Based Awards or
Company Warrants, if any, such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Taxing Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the
Surviving Company of shares of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be
canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration, as provided for in
_Sections 3.1(b)_ and _3.1(c)_ , for each share of Company Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates. All Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Company Stock.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Change in Shares_. If between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time any outstanding shares of Company Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class, solely by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
reverse split, combination or exchange of shares or any other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to
reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, reverse split, combination or exchange of shares or any other similar
transaction and to provide to the holders of Company Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; _p_ _rovided_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 3.8_ shall be construed to permit the

      
 

 



 

Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_**

 



 

Except as disclosed in (i) the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date
hereof (but excluding any forward-looking disclosures set forth in any risk
factor section, any disclosure in any section relating to "forward-looking
statements" and any other disclosures included in any such form, report,
schedule, statement or other document to the extent they are predictive or
forward-looking in nature); _provided_ , that in no event shall any disclosure
in such Company SEC Documents qualify or limit the representations and
warranties in _Section 4.2(a)_, the first three sentences of _Section
4.2(b)_ or _Section 4.3_ or (ii) the corresponding section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (it being understood that any information set forth in one
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
apply to and qualify the representation and warranty set forth in this
Agreement to which it corresponds in number and each other representation and
warranty set forth in this _Article IV_ to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent on its face that such information is relevant to such other
representation and warranty), the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. The Company is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is a
corporation or legal entity duly organized or formed, validly existing and
(where such concept is recognized) in good standing, under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization or formation, except to the extent the failure of
any such Subsidiary to be in good standing has not had, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate or similar entity power and authority
to conduct its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure
to have such power or authority has not had, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign entity to do business, and (where such
concept is recognized) is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing has not had,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "
**Charter** ") and Amended and Restated By-laws of the Company (the " **By-
laws** "), in each case, as most recently filed with the Company SEC
Documents, are, in each case, true, complete and correct copies of such
documents. The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct
copies of the charter and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of each
Subsidiary of the Company, each as in full force and effect as of the date
hereof.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Capitalization; Subsidiaries_. (a) As of the date hereof, the
authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 300,000,000 shares of
Company Common Stock and 30,000,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock. As of

Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per

      
 

 



 

share (the " **Series A Preferred Stock**"), (ii) 23,625 shares of Series B
Junior Participating Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share
(the " **Series B Preferred Stock**") and (iii) 36,900 shares of Series C
Preferred Stock. As of April 15, 2013, (i) 122,104,193 shares of Company
Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of Series A Preferred
Stock or Series B Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, (iii) 36,375
shares of Series C Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding and (iv) no
shares of Company Common Stock were held in treasury. As of the date hereof,
there were (i) 37,532,585 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance
under Company Plans (including, as of April 17, 2013, there were 2,147,183
shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding Company
Options and 4,628,418 shares underlying Company Stock-Based Awards) and,
except as set forth in this clause (i), no other outstanding awards under any
Company Plan denominated in or otherwise tied to the value of a share of
Company Common Stock, (ii) 26,944,444 shares of Company Common Stock reserved
for issuance under the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and
(iii) 8,700,000 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance under the

of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company, or
options, warrants or other rights to acquire any such stock or securities were
issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company are, and all shares that may be issued pursuant
to the Company Plans, the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock and
exercise of the Company Warrants will be, when issued in accordance with the
terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
and not subject to preemptive rights. _Section 4.2(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the date hereof, with respect to each
Company Option, Company Restricted Share and Company Stock Based Award
outstanding under any Company Plan, the number of Shares underlying such
award, expiration date and exercise or conversion price, if applicable,
relating thereto.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 4.2(a)_ and except as expressly permitted
under _Section 6.1_, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, convertible securities or other similar rights, agreements,
commitments or contracts of any kind to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, or securities convertible
into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or
enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right or contract. Except
as set forth in _Section 4.2(a)_, there are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries affecting the voting
rights of or requiring the repurchase, redemption, issuance, creation or
disposition of any equity interests in the Company. Except as set forth in

business on April 15, 2013, the Company has not issued any shares of its
capital stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such capital
stock or any other equity interests in the Company as of such date, except for
issuances pursuant to the exercise, conversion or settlement of Company
Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company Stock-Based Awards, the Series
C Preferred Stock and the Company Warrants. There are no outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the right to
vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to
vote) on any matter on which the stockholders of the Company may vote.

      
 

 



 

(c) Each outstanding share of capital stock of, or other equity interests in,
each Subsidiary of the Company (i) is (to the extent such concept is
applicable) duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and not
subject to preemptive rights, and (ii) is owned, directly or indirectly, by

schedule which has been delivered by Parent to the Company prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the " **Parent Disclosure Schedule** ") (it being
understood that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the

that such information is relevant to such other representation or warranty),

      
 

 



 

Parent and Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to

qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and (where such
concept is recognized) is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or
materially impair the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. A true, complete and
correct copy of the organizational or governing documents of Parent and Merger
Sub (the " **Parent Organizational Documents** ") have previously been
provided to the Company, and each such Parent Organizational Document is in
full force and effect as of the date hereof.

Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action of Parent and Merger Sub (and, with respect to Merger Sub, by its sole
stockholder), and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger (other than, with respect to the consummation of the Merger, the filing
and recordation of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State).
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of

execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, the
consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or performance of their obligations hereunder
will (i) conflict with or violate the Parent Organizational Documents, (ii)
assuming the consents, registrations, filings, notices, approvals and
authorizations specified in _Section 5.3(b)_ have been obtained or made and
the waiting periods referred to therein have expired, and any condition
precedent to such consent, approval, authorization, or waiver has been
satisfied, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub
or by which any property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub is bound or affected
or (iii) result in any breach of, or constitute a default (or an event which
with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to
others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of,
or result in the creation of a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) or Transfer
Restrictions upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub

any note, bond, mortgage, indenture or credit agreement, or any other Contract
or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or
by which Parent or Merger Sub or any property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub
is bound, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
violation, breach, default, right, termination, amendment, acceleration, or
cancellation that would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, materially delay the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger
Sub, the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or performance of their
obligations hereunder will require any consent, approval, authorization,
waiver or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental
Authority, except for (i) the filing with the SEC of such reports under the
Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) compliance with, and the

Merger with the Secretary of State, the other filings required under the DGCL
by the Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of the other jurisdictions in which the Company is qualified to do
business and (iv) such other consents, approvals, authorizations or permits,
filings or notifications, the failure of which to have, make or obtain, as
applicable, would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, materially delay the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there
is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against
either Parent or Merger Sub which seeks to, or would reasonably be expected

and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions
provided for herein.

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to contest, resist and resolve
any such objections or suits and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in
effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to permit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
obligations of Parent under _Section 6.3(a)_, (i) Parent, in the exercise of
its reasonable judgment, shall be entitled to extend any deadline or waiting
period or to enter any arrangement with any Governmental Authority or other
Person to delay the consummation of the Merger, including in connection with
litigation; and (ii) Parent shall be entitled to make material filings with

contemplated by this Agreement in each case in its reasonable judgment, and in
any investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any Governmental
Authority or other Person, or in connection with any regulatory filings under
applicable Antitrust Laws, Parent shall be entitled in its reasonable judgment
to initiate and conduct any communications or negotiations with or make any
proposals to any Governmental Authority relating to any contemplated or
proposed agreements to divest or hold separate assets or limit activities or
lines of business; _provided_ , that Parent shall to the extent practicable
consult in advance with the Company and in good faith take the Companys views
into account regarding the overall strategic direction of the defense of any
such litigation and other matters contemplated by this _Section 6.3(d)(ii)_
and consult with the Company prior to making any material substantive filings.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. From the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the Company will, and
will cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent and its authorized
Representatives (x) reasonable access during normal business hours to their
respective officers, employees, agents, properties, books, contracts and
records as Parent may reasonably request and (y) such financial and operating
data of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request

furnish, or provide any access to, any information to any Person not a party
to, or otherwise covered by, the Confidentiality Agreement or any similar
agreement with the Company, or not otherwise bound by a similar
confidentiality obligation, with respect to such information. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide access to, or
cause its Subsidiaries to provide access to, or disclose any information or
documents which would (in the reasonable judgment of the Company) (i)
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) cause a violation of any confidentiality provision under any material
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (provided
that

      
 

 



 

the Company shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver
from the counterparty to any such Contract so as to allow the Company to
provide access to or furnish the relevant information), (iii) constitute a
waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (iv) violate any applicable Laws; _provided_ , that each
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents
and take such other action (such as the entry into a joint defense agreement
or other arrangement to avoid loss of attorney client privilege) to permit
such access or disclosure. All information exchanged pursuant to this _Section
6.4_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and the parties shall
comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives (as defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement) to comply with, all of their respective
obligations thereunder. The Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the expiration of the Confidentiality Agreement according
to its terms.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Acquisition Proposals_ _._ (a) Except as expressly permitted by
this _Section 6.5_, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time
or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, the Company will not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate the making of any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request for information that may
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) other than
informing Third Parties of the existence of the provisions contained in this
_Section 6.5_, engage in negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any
information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Third
Party relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request
for information that may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal or (iii) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. It is agreed that any violation
of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.5_ by any Representative of
the Company or any of its Affiliates shall constitute a breach of this
_Section 6.5_ by the Company

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the date that the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained
at the Stockholders Meeting, in the event that the Company receives an
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made
after the date of this Agreement and did not result from a breach of this
_Section 6.5_), the Company and the Company Board and their Representatives
may, subject to compliance with this _Section 6.5(b)_, engage in negotiations
or substantive discussions with, or furnish any information and reasonable
access to, any Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors, and
based on information then available, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or is reasonably expected to result in, a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , that (x) prior to furnishing any material nonpublic information,
the Company receives from such Third Party an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (y) any such material nonpublic information so
furnished has been previously provided or made available to Parent or is
provided or made available (including through posting on the Electronic Data
Room) to Parent substantially concurrently with or promptly following it being
so furnished to such Third Party.

      
 

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this _Section
6.5(c)_ and _Section 6.5(d)_, until the termination of this Agreement,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or
qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to
withdraw (or so qualify or modify), the Company Board Recommendation, (B) take
any action to exempt any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) from
the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL or any other state takeover statute,
(C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within four (4)
Business Days after Parent so requests in writing if an Acquisition Proposal
or any material modification thereto shall have been made public or sent or
given to the stockholders of the Company (or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition
Proposal), (D) fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9, against any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D
under the Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of
such Acquisition Proposal, or (E) approve, adopt or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal, or propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "
**Change in Recommendation** ") or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance agreement,
partnership agreement or similar agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) with any Third Party constituting or relating to,
or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (an " **Alternative Acquisition Agreement** ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any
time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, in the event
a material development or material change in circumstances (other than an
Acquisition Proposal) occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement that
was not known and not reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the
date of this Agreement, the Company Board may make a Change in Recommendation
if the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Law; _provided_ , that the Company has provided Parent four (4) Business Days
prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action and
specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action.

 



 

(d) At any time prior to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, in
response to an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal made after the date of
this Agreement that (i) the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor) constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to approve or recommend such Superior
Proposal would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, the Company may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and this _Section
6.5(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and this _Section 6.5(d)_ unless
the Company (x) has complied with its obligations under this _Section 6.5_,
including its obligations set forth in _Section 6.5(e),_ (y) pays, or causes
to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section
8.3(a)(ii)_ prior to or concurrently with such termination and (z)
substantially concurrently with such termination, enters into a definitive
Alternative Acquisition Agreement that documents the terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal.

       
 

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ and _Section 6.5(d)_, (x) unless the Company shall have provided
to Parent four (4) Business Days prior written notice (the " **6.5(e)
Notice**") advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action (and
specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action and the material
terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal) and, if applicable, a copy
of the relevant proposed transaction agreement, and (y):

 



 

(i) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding
changes to the terms of this Agreement intended to cause such Acquisition
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) the Company shall have considered any adjustments to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) and any other agreements that
may be proposed in writing by Parent (the " **Proposed Changed Terms** ") no
later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day of
such four (4) Business Day period and shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if
such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, (A) if Parent, within four (4) Business Days
following its receipt of a 6.5(e) Notice makes an offer that, as determined in
good faith by the Company Board (after consultation with its outside counsel
and financial advisors) results in the applicable Acquisition Proposal no
longer being a Superior Proposal, then the Company shall have no right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and _Section
6.5(d)_ as a result of such Acquisition Proposal, and (B) any (1) material
revisions to the terms of a Superior Proposal or (B) material revisions to an
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board had determined no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal, shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal
and shall in each case require the Company to deliver to Parent a new 6.5(e)
Notice and a new four (4) Business Day period shall commence thereafter.

 



 

(f) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) advise
Parent orally or in writing in the event that the Company receives any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request for information that
may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and in
connection with such notice, provide to Parent the material terms and
conditions (including the identity of the Third Party making any such
Acquisition Proposal) of any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall (i)
keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material details (including
any material change to the terms thereof) of any such Acquisition Proposal
(including any determination by the Company Board pursuant to _Section
6.5(b)_) and any discussions and negotiations concerning the material terms
and conditions thereof and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and
in any event within 24 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof of any written
indication of interest (or amendment thereto) or any written material that
constitutes an offer (or amendment thereto).

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i)

      
 

 



 

taking and disclosing any position or disclosing any information reasonably
required under Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer) or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to
the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , that in all cases, any such action or disclosure
shall comply with _Section 6.5(c)_, _Section 6.5(d)_, and _Section 6.5(e)_.

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " **Acquisition Proposal** " shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any bona fide proposal or offer from a Third
Party relating to (i) a merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries whose revenues, income, EBITDA or assets, individually or
in the aggregate, constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated
revenues, income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii)
the acquisition (whether by merger, consolidation, equity investment, joint
venture or otherwise) by any Person of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (based on fair
market value, as determined in good faith by the Company Board); (iii) the
acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, by any Person of twenty
percent (20%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock; (iv) any purchase, acquisition, tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any Person beneficially owning twenty percent
(20%) or more of the Company Common Stock or any class of equity or voting
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose revenues, income,
EBITDA or assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty percent
(20%) or more of the consolidated revenues, income, EBITDA or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, or (v) any combination of the foregoing.

 



 

(ii) " **Superior Proposal** " shall mean an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_
, that the references to " **twenty percent (20%** )" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to " **ninety percent
(90%** )") made by a Third Party that the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys financial and legal advisors, and
considering such factors as the Company Board considers in good faith to be
appropriate (including the conditionality and the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such proposal), (A) is on terms that are more favorable to the
holders of Company Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(after giving effect to all Proposed Changed Terms) from a financial point of
view and (B) is reasonably expected to be consummated on a timely basis.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a)
Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification
(and all rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto) for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger), existing in favor of the Indemnitees as provided in the
Charter or By-laws

      
 

 



 

as in effect on the date of this Agreement (or such equivalent organizational
or governing documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect on
the date of this Agreement) or under the indemnification, employment or other
similar agreements between any Indemnitee and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries set forth on _Section 6.6_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (a
complete and correct copy of each such agreement having been made available to
Parent by the Company prior to the date hereof), shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective
terms to the extent permitted by applicable Law. From and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to (including by providing funding to the extent the Surviving
Corporation does not have sufficient funds), indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and advance expenses to, Indemnitees with respect to (x) all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time at or prior to the
Effective Time or (y) any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding to each
Indemnitee), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened
Proceeding by reason of the fact that such Person was acting in such capacity
or anything done or not done by such Person in such capacity at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether such Proceeding is initiated before or after the
Effective Time, in either case, to the extent required by (X) the Charter or
By-laws (or such equivalent organizational or governing documents of any of
the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement) or (Y)
to the extent an Indemnitee is afforded greater rights or remedies than
provided under the Charter or Bylaws, the agreements set forth on _Section
6.6_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. In the event of any such Proceeding,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall control the defense of such
Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle any such Proceeding without the prior written consent
of the Indemnitee unless the Surviving Corporation assumes full responsibility
for such settlement, the settlement grants the Indemnitee a complete release
in respect of the potential liability relating to the claims underlying such
Proceeding and such settlement does not contain any admission detrimental to
the Indemnitee. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, cause the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of director, officer
and employee liability that are no less favorable to the Indemnitees than
those set forth in the Charter and By-laws and the Companys Subsidiaries
organizational documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which
provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
Indemnitees. From and after the Effective Time, in the event the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries does not have sufficient funds to honor
each of the respective agreements contained in this _Section 6.6(a)_ in
accordance with their respective terms, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary, as the case may be,
sufficient funds so that such Person may honor the applicable agreements
contained in this _Section 6.6(a)_.

 



 

(b) From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time (the " **Tail Period** "), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the Companys current directors
and officers liability insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance
policies covering each officer and director currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policies and fiduciary liability
insurance

      
 

 



 

policies for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with
respect to any matter claimed against such Person by reason of him or her
serving in such capacity on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no
less favorable in the aggregate than those of such policies in effect on the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may (i)
substitute therefor policies of any reputable insurance company or (ii)
satisfy its obligation under this _Section 6.6(b)_ by obtaining prepaid (or
"tail") directors and officers liability insurance policies and fiduciary
liability insurance policies, in each case, the material terms of which,
including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in the aggregate to such
directors and officers than the insurance coverage otherwise required under
this _Section 6.6(b)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the
aggregate costs of any of the foregoing insurance policies exceed in any one
year during the Tail Period 250% of the current aggregate annual premiums paid
by the Company for such purpose (the Companys current aggregate annual
premiums are set forth in _Section 6.6(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule); for the avoidance of doubt, it being understood that in such case
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall nevertheless be obligated to obtain
such coverage, with respect to each year during the Tail Period, as may be
obtained for 250% of the current aggregate annual premium paid by the Company.

 



 

(c) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6_. The provisions of this _Section 6.6_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs or representatives. Parent shall pay or cause to be paid all
reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnitee in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this _Section 6.6_.

 



 

(d) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.6_ shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the Charter or By-laws (or
equivalent organizational or governing documents of any of the Companys
Subsidiaries), certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation, the indemnification, employment or
other similar agreements between any Indemnitee and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries set forth on _Section 6.6_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
or under any applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this _Section 6.6_
shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their
successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, Parent shall ensure that proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume and succeed
to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. From and after the date hereof
until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1_ and the Effective Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company,
upon receiving Knowledge of (a) any notice,

      
 

 



 

complaint, investigation or hearing (or communications indicating that the
same may be contemplated) of any Governmental Authority in connection with
this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any
written notice of any Person (other than a Governmental Authority) alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such
communication could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, (c) any Proceeding commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened
in writing against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (d) any fact, event or circumstance that
would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein, or (e) any material
change, effect or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to give rise
to a failure of a condition precedent in _Section 7.2_ (in the case of the
Company) and _Section 7.3_ (in the case of Parent); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties hereunder or the remedies available hereunder to
any Party; _provided, further_ , that a failure to give prompt notice pursuant
to this _Section 6.7_ shall not of itself constitute a breach giving rise to
the failure of a condition to the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ except to
the extent that the underlying fact or circumstance not so notified would
standing alone constitute a breach giving rise to such a failure.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release(s) announcing
the execution of this Agreement shall be in a form mutually agreed upon by
Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give each other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on, any other press release or other public
announcements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement prior to such consultation, except to the extent the disclosing
party determines based on advice of counsel it is required to do so by
applicable Law, court process or the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system, in which case
such party shall use reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party
before issuing any such release or making any such public announcement.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) the Company will no
longer be required to consult with Parent in connection with any such press
release or public announcement if the Company Board has effected any Change in
Recommendation or shall have resolved to do so and (ii) the requirements of
this _Section 6.8_ shall not apply to any disclosure by Company or Parent of
any information concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon
Parents request, (x) the Company and Parent shall promptly prepare a mutually
acceptable joint written presentation to Institutional Shareholder Services
recommending this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, (y) the Company shall request a meeting with
Institutional Shareholder Services for purposes of obtaining its
recommendation of the approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company and (z) the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent to obtain
such recommendation.

      
 

 



 

Section 6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor, in accordance with their terms, all existing
employment, change in control and severance agreements between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) _Continuing Employees_.

 



 

(i) During the one (1)-year period commencing at the Effective Time or such
shorter period as the applicable employee may be employed, Parent shall
provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each person who
is an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time and who continues as an employee of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its affiliates (each, a " **Company Employee** ") a base
salary or wage rate and annual cash bonus opportunity at least equal to the
Company Employees base salary or wage rate and annual bonus opportunity in
effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and benefits (other than
with respect to equity or equity based-awards) that are, in the aggregate,
substantially no less favorable than those in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(ii) For purposes of eligibility and vesting under the compensation and
benefit plans, programs agreements and arrangements of Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any respective Subsidiary and Affiliate thereof
providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Merger Closing (the "
**New Plans** "), and benefit accrual solely for purposes of determining
accrual of vacation and severance benefits under New Plans, if applicable,
each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with
the Company (including any predecessor), the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor
employer) before the Merger Closing, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Merger Closing, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Benefit Plan. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents to the extent such exclusions or
requirements were waived or satisfied under the comparable Company Benefit
Plan, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee
and his or her covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the
portion of the plan year prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance,
co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

      
 

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.9_, the terms and
conditions of employment for any Company Employees that are governed by a
collective bargaining agreement immediately prior to the Merger Closing shall
continue to be governed by such collective bargaining agreement as of the
Merger Closing until the expiration, termination or modification of such
agreement in accordance with its terms or applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Prior to making any broad-based or otherwise material written
communication to any current or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company or
its Subsidiaries shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on, and consent to (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) such communication.

 



 

(d) This _Section 6.9_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.9_
or any other provision in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this _Section 6.9_ or any other provision of this
Agreement or is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an
amendment to or modification of the Company Benefit Plans or any other
employee benefit plan or arrangement of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates unless this Agreement explicitly states that the
provision "amends" such Company Benefit Plan, or any other employee benefit
plans or arrangements, or limit in any way the right of the Company, Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plans or arrangements. This shall
not prevent the parties entitled to enforce this Agreement from enforcing any
provision in this Agreement, but no other party shall be entitled to enforce
any provision in this Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment to such
Company Benefit Plan or arrangement. If a party not entitled to enforce this
Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to enforce any provision in this
Agreement as an amendment to such Company Benefit Plan or arrangement and that
provision is construed to be such an amendment despite not being explicitly
designated as one in this Agreement, that provision shall lapse retroactively
as of its inception, thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect.
Nothing in this _Section 6.9_ or any other provision in this Agreement shall
limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Company Employee at any time
following the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
may take such further actions, if any, as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who
is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act are exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Credit Facility_. The Company shall, with immediately available
funds provided by Parent or otherwise available to the Company, at the
Effective Time, repay in full all indebtedness (and other amounts required to
be repaid) under the Credit Facility and terminate all commitments,
obligations and agreements under the Credit Facility, and the Company shall
obtain customary pay-off letters and the release of related Liens, including
the

      
 

 



 

related filings and return of collateral (including certificated securities),
in each case in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent. In
connection therewith, Parent shall take all actions reasonably requested by
the Company to facilitate such prepayment and termination which actions shall
include, without limitation, Parent depositing or causing to be deposited, not
later than the Effective Time, with the Credit Facility Agent all amounts
specified by the Credit Facility Agent as being necessary to cash
collateralize any letters of credit and bankers acceptances outstanding under
the Credit Facility and to prepay all indebtedness under the Credit Facility
(including any fees, expenses, costs, commitment fees, penalties, and other
amounts payable to the Credit Facility Agent or the Credit Facility Lenders
under the Credit Facility). Unless the Credit Facility Agent has otherwise
waived or modified any notice requirements under the Credit Facility
Agreement, the Company, in consultation with Parent, will provide the advance
notice required under the Credit Facility Agreement, if any, of its intention
to repay all indebtedness under the Credit Facility and to terminate the
commitments of the Credit Facility Lenders thereunder as of the anticipated
date that the Effective Time will occur, as determined by mutual agreement of
the Company and Parent, as specified in such notice (the " **Anticipated
Prepayment Date** "). In the event that the actual date of such repayment and
termination does not occur on the Anticipated Prepayment Date as a result of
the breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, Parent shall reimburse
the Company for any actual out-of-pocket costs or expenses that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries incurs as a direct result of the failure of the
Company to so repay such indebtedness and terminate such commitments on the
Anticipated Prepayment Date.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent
reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives shall
compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding any such stockholder
litigation or consent to the same unless Parent shall have consented in
writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that after receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, the Company shall cooperate with Parent with respect to,
and, if requested by Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to defend or to
settle, any unresolved stockholder litigation in accordance with Parents
direction. Any such participation by Parent will be at Parents sole cost and
expense.

of any conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.3_ to be
satisfied if such failure was caused by the Companys breach of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_**

 



 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after the Requisite Stockholder Approval is
obtained (except as otherwise expressly noted), as follows:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of each of Parent and the Company; or

 



 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if:

 



 

(i) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before 5:00 p.m. (New
York City time) on January 21, 2014 (the " **Outside Date** "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section
7.1(_ _c_ _)_ shall not have been satisfied or duly waived by all parties
entitled to the benefit of such condition by the second (2nd) Business Day
prior to the Outside Date (and all other conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ have been satisfied or shall be capable of being satisfied), either
Parent or the Company may, by written notice delivered to such other party,
extend the Outside Date until April 21, 2014 (such date as may be extended,
the " **Termination Date** "); _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be
available to a party if such party has breached or violated any of its
covenants, agreements or other obligations hereunder and such breach or
violation has been the principal cause of or directly resulted in (1) the
failure to satisfy the conditions to the obligations of the terminating party
to consummate the Merger set forth in _Article VII_

      
 

 



 

prior to the Termination Date or (2) the failure of the Merger Closing to
occur by the Termination Date; or

 



 

(ii) any Restraint shall be in effect enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger, and such Restraint shall have become final and
non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall have complied with
its obligations under _Section 6.3_ to prevent, oppose or remove such
Restraint; or

 



 

(iii) the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof; or

 



 

(c) by the Company if:

 



 

(i) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of their
respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would give
rise to a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.1_, _Section
7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ and (y) (A) is not capable of being cured prior
to the Termination Date or (B) is not cured by Parent or Merger Sub on or
before the earlier of (i) the Termination Date and (ii) the date that is
thirty (30) days following the receipt by Parent of written notice from the
Company of such breach or failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
notice is received within five (5) Business Days of the Termination Date, the
Termination Date shall be extended by five (5) Business Days; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company shall not have a right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ if the Company is then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements hereunder; or

 



 

(ii) prior to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company Board
has determined to enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal to the extent permitted by, and subject to
the terms and conditions of _Section 6.5(d)_ and _Section 6.5(e)_, so long
as the Company (A) concurrently with such termination pays, or causes to be
paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee specified in _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_
and (B) substantially concurrently with such termination enters into such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

 



 

(d) by Parent:

 



 

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would give rise to the
failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2(a)_ or
_Section 7.2(b)_ and (y) (A) is not capable of being cured prior to the
Termination Date or (B) is not cured by the Company on or before the earlier
of (i) the Termination Date and (ii) the date that is thirty (30) days
following the receipt by the Company of written notice from Parent of such
breach or failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such notice is received
within five (5) Business Days

      
 

 



 

of the Termination Date, the Termination Date shall be extended by five (5)
Business Days; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall not have a right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ if Parent or
Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; or

 



 

(ii) in the event that (A) the Company shall have failed to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement distributed to its
stockholders, (B) a Change in Recommendation has occurred, or (C) the Company,
any Affiliate of the Company, or any employee, officer or director of the
Company or of any Affiliate of the Company shall have committed an Intentional
Breach of the obligations or agreements contained in _Section 6.5_ in any
material respect or authorized or permitted any of their respective
Representatives to take any action in breach of the obligations or agreements
contained in _Section 6.5_ in any material respect, and, in either case, such
breach gave rise to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall no longer be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ once the Requisite Stockholder Approval has been
obtained at the Stockholders Meeting.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties, specifying the provisions hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made and the basis therefor described in
reasonable detail, and, except as set forth in this _Section 8.2_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and of no effect without
liability on the part of any party hereto (or any of its Representatives), and
all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease; _provided_ , that
if (x) such termination resulted, directly or indirectly, from the Intentional
Breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein or (y) the Intentional Breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement contained herein shall cause the Merger Closing not to
occur, then, notwithstanding such termination, such breaching party shall be
fully liable for any and all Damages as a result of such Intentional Breach;
_provided_ , _further_ that the Confidentiality Agreement, and the provisions
of _Section 4.26_, _Section 5.7_, _Section 6.4_ (last two sentences only),
_Section 6.11_ (last sentence only) _Article I_, _Article VIII_ and
_Article IX _shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Termination Fees_.

 



 

(a) _Termination Fees Payable_. If the Agreement is terminated by:

 



 

(i) (x) either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or by
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, and (y) (A) the Company receives or
has received an Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party after the date hereof
or an Acquisition Proposal shall have become publicly known prior to such
termination, and (B) within twelve (12) months of such termination of this
Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) recommends
an Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of the Company and an Acquisition
Proposal is subsequently consummated (for the avoidance of doubt, such
consummation may be during or after such 12-month period), then the Company
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent an amount equal to $20,000,000
(Twenty Million Dollars) (the " **Company Termination Fee** ") by wire

      
 

 



 

transfer of immediately available funds not later than the second (2nd)
Business Day following the date of the consummation of an Acquisition Proposal
( _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(i)_, the
references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)");

 



 

(ii) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, then the Company shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire
transfer of immediately available funds substantially concurrently with, and
as a condition to, such termination;

 



 

(iii) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds not later than the second (2nd) Business Day
following such termination; and

 



 

(iv) either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or by
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent
an amount equal to the sum of all documented, reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its Affiliates)
incurred by Parent or Merger Sub or on their behalf in connection with or
related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement not to exceed $7,500,000 (the " **Parent
Expenses** ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds not later than
the second (2nd) Business Day following such termination.

 



 

(b) Certain Limitations.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 



 

(1) in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Parent Expenses on
more than one occasion, and

 



 

(2) (x) in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion, and (y) in the event the Parent
Expenses have already been paid under _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_, the Company shall
be entitled to credit the amount of the Parent Expenses actually paid against
the amount of the Company Termination Fee it is required to pay under _Section
8.3(a)(i)_.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section 9.9_ (which shall not be limited by this _Section
8.3(b)(ii)_), in the event the Termination Fee is paid by the Company as
required pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_, Parents right to receive payment from
the Company of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent,
Merger Sub and their Affiliates and Representatives against the Company and
its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or

      
 

 



 

future general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees (collectively,
the " **Company Related Parties** ") for all Damages suffered as a result of
the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and
upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby (except that, to the extent
any termination of this Agreement resulted, directly or indirectly, from an
Intentional Breach of this Agreement by the Company, Parent shall be entitled
to both the payment of the Company Termination Fee and/or the Parent Expenses
(in each case to the extent owed pursuant to _Section 8.3_ _(a)_ ) and to any
Damages, to the extent proven, in respect of such Intentional Breach (as
reduced by any Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses previously paid by
the Company).

 



 

(c) _Integral Part of Transaction_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the Company
Termination Fee is not a penalty, and except as set forth in _Section
8.3(b)(ii)_, constitutes liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company
fails to pay the Company Termination Fee and/or the Parent Expenses pursuant
to this _Section 8.3_ when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
Company Termination Fee and/or the Parent Expenses, as the case may be, the
Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees
and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the amount of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses, as the case
may be, from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards
of directors at any time before or after receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Requisite Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that by Law
requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject
to the proviso of the first sentence of _Section 8.4_, waive compliance with
any agreement or condition contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver

      
 

 



 

thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth herein (including
_Section 8.2_ and _Section 8.3_), all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
or expenses, whether or not the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article,
Section, Appendix, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an
Article or Section of, or an Appendix, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit to, this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings for
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein,"
"hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole, including all
Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes and Appendices, and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have
the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or
delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined herein. References to a
Person are also to its successors and permitted assigns. The words "made
available to Parent" or words of similar import refer to documents (x) posted
to the Electronic Data Room or (y) delivered in Person or electronically to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives. The
specification of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained
in _Article IV_ or _Article V_ is not intended to imply that such amount, or
higher or lower amounts, are or are not material for purposes of this
Agreement, and no party

      
 

 



 

shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount in any dispute or
controversy between or among the parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described herein or included in the Company Disclosure Schedule or
the Parent Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Words describing the singular number shall be deemed to include the
plural and vice versa, and words denoting any gender shall be deemed to
include all genders.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future Law
or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable,
(b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (c) all
other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable

 ** _Exhibit A_**

 



 

AMENDED AND RESTATED

 



 

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 



 

OF

 



 

POWER-ONE, INC.

 



 

I, THE UNDERSIGNED, in order to form a corporation for the purposes
hereinafter stated, under and pursuant to the provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware General Corporation
Law_ "), do hereby certify as follows:

 



 

FIRST: The name of the corporation is Power-One, Inc. (hereinafter referred to
as the " _Corporation_ ").

 



 

SECOND: The registered office of the Corporation is to be located at 1209
Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington, in the County of New Castle, in the
State of Delaware, 19801. The name of its registered agent at that address is
The Corporation Trust Company.

 



 

THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which a corporation may be organized under the Delaware General
Corporation Law. The Corporation shall have perpetual existence.

 



 

FOURTH: The total number of shares of capital stock that the Company has
authority to issue is 1,000 shares, which will be designated common stock, par
value $0.001 per share.

      
 

 



 

FIFTH: The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for
further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation
and of its directors and stockholders:

 



 

(1) The number of directors of the Corporation shall be such as from time to
time shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the by-laws. Election of
directors need not be by ballot unless the by-laws so provide.

 



 

(2) The Board of Directors shall have powers without the assent or vote of the
stockholders to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the by-laws of
the Corporation; to fix and vary the amount to be reserved for any proper
purpose; to authorize and cause to be executed mortgages and liens upon all or
any part of the property of the Corporation; to determine the use and
disposition of any surplus or net profits; and to fix the times for the
declaration and payment of dividends.

 



 

(3) The directors in their discretion may submit any contract or act for
approval or ratification at any annual meeting of the stockholders or at any
meeting of the stockholders called for the purpose of considering any such act
or contract, and any contract or act that shall be approved or be ratified by
the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation which is
represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat
(provided that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there represented in person
or by proxy) shall be as valid and as binding upon the Corporation and upon
all the stockholders as though it had been approved or ratified by every
stockholder of the Corporation, whether or not the contract or act would
otherwise be open to legal attack because of directors interest, or for any
other reason.

      
 

 



 

(4) In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute
expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise
all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by
the Corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the statutes of
Delaware, of this certificate, and to any by-laws from time to time made by
the stockholders; provided, however, that no by-laws so made shall invalidate
any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if such by-law had
not been made.

 



 

SIXTH: The Corporation shall, to the full extent permitted by Section 145 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended, indemnify all persons whom it may indemnify pursuant thereto. To the
fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same
exists or may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be
liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach
of fiduciary duty as a director. The liability of a director of the
Corporation to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages shall
be eliminated to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law in the
event it is determined that Delaware law does not apply. The Corporation is
authorized to provide by bylaw, agreement or otherwise for indemnification of
directors, offices, employees and agents for breach of duty to the Corporation
and its stockholders in excess of the indemnification otherwise permitted by
applicable law. Any repeal or modification of this Article shall not result in
any liability for a director with respect to any action or omission occurring
prior to such repeal or modification.

 



 

SEVENTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the
Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between the
Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable
jurisdiction within the State of

      
 

 



 

Delaware, may, on the application in a summary way of the Corporation or of
any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or
receivers appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of section 291 of
Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution
or of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under the
provisions of section 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting of
the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of
stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such
manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three-
fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the
stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be,
agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of the
Corporation as consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said
compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by
the court to which the said application has been made, be binding on all the
creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of
stockholders, of the Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the
Corporation.

 



 

EIGHTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this certificate of incorporation in the manner now
or hereafter prescribed by law, and all rights and powers conferred herein on
stockholders, directors and officers are subject to this reserved power.
