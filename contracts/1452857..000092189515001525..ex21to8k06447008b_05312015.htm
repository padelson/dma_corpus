NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set

ARTICLE I 
 

  

  

The Merger

  

  

SECTION 1.01. The Merger. At the Effective Time, Sub shall merge with and into
the Company in accordance with the DGCL and the Limited Liability Company Act
of the State of Delaware (the "LLC Act") (the "Merger"), whereupon the
separate existence of Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation of Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as is
specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time"). From and after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to all the assets,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to all of the
liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Sub, as
provided under the DGCL and the LLC Act.

  

  

SECTION 1.02. Merger Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Merger Closing")
will take place at 10:00 a.m., San Francisco time, on the second (2nd)
business day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Merger Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions),
at the offices of O'Melveny and Myers LLP, Two Embarcadero Center, 28th Floor,
San Francisco, California 94111, unless another time, date or place is agreed
to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Merger Closing
occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Merger Closing Date".

  

  

SECTION 1.03. Certificate of Merger. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable on the Merger Closing Date,
the parties shall file a certificate of merger to effect the Merger (the
"Certificate of Merger"), in such form as is required by, and executed and
acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the
LLC Act, and shall make all other filings and recordings required under the
DGCL and the LLC Act.

  

  

SECTION 1.04. Organizational Documents. (a) As of the Effective Time, without
any further action on the part of any party or the stockholders of the
Company, the certificate of incorporation attached hereto as Exhibit A shall
be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until
amended in accordance with applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the bylaws attached hereto as Exhibit B
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and shall be the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable Law.

  

  

SECTION 1.05. Directors. From and after the Effective Time, until successors
are duly elected or appointed in accordance with applicable Law (or their
earlier resignation or removal), the directors listed on Exhibit C hereto
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

SECTION 1.06. Officers. From and after the Effective Time, until successors
are duly elected or appointed in accordance with applicable Law (or their
earlier resignation or removal), the officers of Sub at the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

ARTICLE II 
 

  

  

Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the

  

Constituent Corporations; Exchange Fund;

  

  

SECTION 2.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, HandH Group,
HandH Acquisition Sub, Sub or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock
or any shares of capital stock or membership interests of Parent, HandH Group,
HandH Acquisition Sub or Sub:

  

  

(a) Capital Stock of Sub. The membership interests of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become such number of shares equal to the difference between the number of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger Closing, less the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by
Steel Partners Holdings, L.P. ("Steel") or any of its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Merger Closing, such number of shares to be validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock and Affiliate Owned
Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that is directly owned by the Company as treasury
stock, or by Parent, HandH Group, HandH Acquisition Sub or Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, at such time, shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding (i)
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b), (ii) except as
provided in Section 2.01(d), the Appraisal Shares, and (iii) shares of Company
Common Stock owned by Steel and any of its Subsidiaries, which shall remain
outstanding) shall be converted into the right to receive $11.00 in cash (the
"Per Share Merger Consideration"). The aggregate value of the Per Share Merger
Consideration required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement is referred to
herein as the "Merger Consideration". At the Effective Time, all such shares
of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each person that immediately prior
to the Effective Time held a certificate that at such time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") or uncertificated
shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares")
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement, the
Merger Consideration and any dividends declared not in violation of Section
4.01(a) with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at
the Effective Time and that are due to such holder.

(d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, the
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after the Effective Time, any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and
shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in Section 2.01(c), without any interest thereon. The Company shall give
notice to HandH Group of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, which in each case shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and treated as Information (as
defined under the Confidentiality Agreement), and HandH Group shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands, in any case at the sole cost and expense of HandH
Group. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of HandH Group (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit
to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

(e) Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination of shares or
exchange of shares, or any similar stock event shall have occurred, then the
Per Share Merger Consideration, the Award Amounts and the number of shares of
the Surviving Corporation provided in Section 2.01(a) shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change.

SECTION 2.02. Exchange Fund. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Merger Closing
Date, HandH Group shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the
Merger Consideration and the Award Amounts (other than the amounts
contemplated by Section 2.03(b), which shall be paid in accordance with
Section 2.03(b)), in each case, in accordance with this Article II and, in
connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agency Agreement").
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub or HandH Group shall
deposit or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, in trust for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and holders of Company Awards,
(i) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.01(c), (ii) cash sufficient to pay the aggregate
Award Amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.03 (other than Section 2.03(b),
which shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.03(b)) and (iii) cash
sufficient to pay any dividends declared not in violation of Section 4.01(a)
with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the
Effective Time (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not
expressly provided for in this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event more than two (2) business days thereafter),
Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub and HandH Group shall cause the Paying Agent to mail
to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to
the Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form (including
customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with
respect to Book-Entry Shares)) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and any dividends declared not in violation of Section 4.01(a)
with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the
Effective Time with respect to such Company Common Stock. Each holder of
record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate or such Book-Entry Share as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as applicable, shall have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c), together with
any dividends declared not in violation of Section 4.01(a) with a record date
prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time with
respect to such Company Common Stock, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration, together with any
dividends declared not in violation of Section 4.01(a) with a record date
prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time with
respect to such Company Common Stock, may be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration, together with any such dividends to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of HandH Group that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall
only be made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration, together with any dividends declared not in violation of
Section 4.01(a) with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain
unpaid at the Effective Time with respect to such Company Common Stock, which
the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall be paid or
will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent, HandH Group, HandH Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate
to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and Broadridge Financial
Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge") to provide that the Paying Agent will transmit
to Broadridge or its nominee as promptly as practicable after the Merger
Closing (and, in any event, no later than the first (1st) business day after
the Merger Closing) an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to
the number of shares of Company Common Stock held of record by Broadridge or
such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Per
Share Merger Consideration. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time (but in any event within one (1) business day thereafter), Parent, HandH
Acquisition Sub and HandH Group shall cause the Paying Agent to disburse by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
the Company prior to the Merger Closing an amount equal to the Award Amounts
(other than the Award Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(b)).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All cash paid in
accordance with the terms of this Article II upon the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article
II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving
Corporation's obligation to pay all dividends declared not in violation of
Section 4.01(a) with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain
unpaid at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share is presented to HandH Group or the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it
shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration to
the holder thereof as provided in this Article II.

  

  

(d) Termination of the Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or the Book-Entry
Shares or the holders of Company Awards for twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to HandH Group, upon demand, and any holders
of the Certificates or the Book-Entry Shares or holders of Company Awards, who
have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub or HandH Group (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for, and Parent,
HandH Acquisition Sub and HandH Group (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the
Merger Consideration and the Award Amounts pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II and any dividends declared not in violation of Section 4.01(a) with
a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective
Time and that are due to any such holder.

  

  

(e) No Liability. None of Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official in compliance with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange
Fund as directed by HandH Group. Any interest or other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to HandH Group, upon demand, but in no event
shall there be at any time insufficient cash representing the Exchange Fund to
pay Merger Consideration and the Award Amounts in accordance with this
Agreement. Until the termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section
2.02(d), to the extent there are any losses with respect to any investment of
the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the
level required to enable the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payments with
respect to the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) for all
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares not surrendered and Award Amounts pursuant
to Section 2.03 for all Company Awards (other than Award Amounts pursuant to
Section 2.03(b)), Parent or HandH Group shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so
as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient to enable the Paying Agent to make such payments. Nothing contained
herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund
shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
to receive the Merger Consideration or any holder of a Company Award to
receive such holder's Award Amount, in each case, as provided herein.

  

  

(g) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends declared not in violation of
Section 4.01(a) with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain
unpaid at the Effective Time with respect thereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) Withholding Rights. Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share or any holder of a Company Award such
amounts as Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificate or the
Book-Entry Share or the holder of the Company Award, as the case may be, in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, HandH
Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

  

  

SECTION 2.03. Company Awards.

  

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Merger Closing Date, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee of the Company Board administering the Company
Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be
required to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share
of Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be fully vested and treated as outstanding Company Common
Stock entitled to Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the options to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock held by Mikel Williams shall be
redeemed for cash on the Merger Closing Date in accordance with the terms of
the Company Award governing such options and the Separation Agreement, dated
as of the date hereof (the "Separation Agreement"), between Mr. Williams and
the Company, and, as provided in the Separation Agreement, Mr. Williams shall
be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of the
Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to such options, multiplied by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such stock options (whether vested or
unvested). This Award Amount shall be paid to Mr. Williams in accordance with
the Code Section 409A six-month distribution delay rule applicable to payments
to "specified employees" (as defined in Code Section 409A) in connection with
a separation from service. Immediately prior to the Merger Closing, the
Company shall pay the amounts owed pursuant to this Section 2.03(b) to a
grantor trust as provided in the Separation Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings
specified below:

  

  

"Award Amounts" means, collectively, all amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 2.03.

  

  

"Company Awards" means, collectively, all Company Stock Options and shares of
Company Restricted Stock.

Representations and Warranties

  

  

SECTION 3.01. Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as set
forth in the Company Disclosure Letter (it being understood that any
information set forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the Section or subsection of
this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and each other Section or
subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that
such information is relevant to such other Section or subsection), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub as

power and authority to carry on its business as presently conducted. Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and is in good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable
Law) in each U.S. jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, other than where the failure to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to
HandH Group true and complete copies of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company (the "Company Certificate of Incorporation") and
the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company (the "Company By-Laws"), in
each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Listed in Section
3.01(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter is each jurisdiction in which the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of a state
within the United States is qualified to do business as of the date of this
Agreement.

  

  

(b) Subsidiaries. Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists, as
of the date of this Agreement, each Subsidiary of the Company and the
jurisdiction of organization thereof. All the outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have

directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all pledges, liens,
charges, mortgages, encumbrances or security interests of any kind or nature
(collectively, "Liens"), other than Permitted Liens. Except for its interests
in its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any
capital stock of, or other equity interests in, any corporation, partnership,
joint venture, association or other entity and no Subsidiary owns, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity interests in, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, association or other entity. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to acquire any
equity interest, security, right, agreement or commitment or to provide funds
to or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise) in, any person. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
options, warrants, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, stock-based
performance units, Contracts or undertakings to which the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which any of them is bound (i)
obligating the Company or any such Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or
cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of or equity interests in, or any security convertible
or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock or other voting securities of
or equity interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) obligating any such
Subsidiary to issue, grant or enter into any such option, warrant, right,
security, unit, Contract or undertaking or (iii) that give any person the
right to receive any economic interest of a nature accruing to the holders of
capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Company.

(c) Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
22,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 3,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company Preferred Stock"), of which
220,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock were designated by the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") as Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock and are issuable upon exercise of the rights
(the "Company Rights") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of May
2, 2005, as amended, between the Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company (as amended from time to time, the "Company Rights Agreement"). As of
the date hereof, (i) 10,408,460 shares of Company Common Stock (which includes

conditions or repurchase by the Company (such shares, the "Company Restricted
Stock")) were issued and outstanding, (ii) 415,059 shares of Company Common
Stock were subject to outstanding options to acquire shares of Company Common

issuances by the Company of options, warrants, rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities, stock-based performance units or other rights to
acquire shares of capital stock of the Company or other rights that give the
holder thereof any economic interest of a nature accruing to the holders of
Company Common Stock, other than issuances of Company Restricted Stock. All
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are, and all such shares that may
be issued prior to the Effective Time will be, when issued, duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive
rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the
Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for,
securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which holders of
Company Common Stock may vote ("Voting Company Debt"). Except for any
obligations pursuant to this Agreement or as otherwise set forth above, as of
the date of this Agreement, there are no options, warrants, rights,
convertible or exchangeable securities, stock-based performance units,
Contracts or undertakings of any kind to which the Company is a party or by
which the Company is bound (1) obligating the Company to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of or equity interests in, or any security
convertible or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of or equity interest in, the Company or any Voting Company Debt,
(2) obligating the Company to issue, grant or enter into any such option,
warrant, right, security, unit, Contract or undertaking or (3) that give any
person the right to receive any economic interest of a nature accruing to the
holders of Company Common Stock. As of the date of this Agreement, there are
no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock or options, warrants, rights,
convertible or exchangeable securities, stock-based performance units or other
rights to acquire shares of capital stock of the Company, other than pursuant

permitted by Section 2.03 of this Agreement are permissible under the Company
Stock Plan and any applicable Company Award without consent from the holder of

(d) Authority; Noncontravention. (i) The Company has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by, and compliance with the provisions of, this Agreement by the
Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the

applicable Law, to receipt of the Stockholder Approvals. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due

Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency and other Laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to
general equity principles. The Company Board, acting upon the recommendation
of the Special Committee, at a meeting duly called and held at which all
directors of the Company were present, unanimously adopted resolutions (A)
authorizing and approving the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (B) approving and
declaring advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (C) declaring that the terms of this Agreement

as of the date of this Agreement, have not been rescinded, modified or
withdrawn in any way.

  

  

(ii) Except as set forth in Section 3.01(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not,
and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a
benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under (other
than any such Lien created as a result of any action taken by or at the
request of Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group or Sub), any provision of
(A) the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company By-Laws or the
comparable organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries or (B) subject
to the filings and other matters referred to in the immediately following
sentence, (1) any contract, lease, indenture, note, bond or other written
agreement that is in force and effect (a "Contract") to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective
properties or assets are bound, or (2) any supranational, federal, national,
state, provincial or local statute, law (including common law), ordinance,
rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority ("Law") or any judgment,
order or decree of any Governmental Authority ("Judgment"), in each case,
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clause (B) above,
any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights, losses or Liens
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. No consent, approval, order, waiver or

such consents, approvals, orders, waivers, authorizations, actions,
nonactions, registrations, declarations, filings and notices required under
any applicable real property transfer Law or Environmental Law and (V) such
other consents, approvals, orders, waivers, authorizations, actions,
nonactions, registrations, declarations, filings and notices the failure of
which to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities. Section 3.01(e) of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the audited consolidated balance sheet of
the Company, and the related consolidated statements of operations and cash
flows, as of November 1, 2014 and November 2, 2013, together with the notes to
such financial statements (the "Financial Statements"). The Financial
Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP consistently applied
(except in each case as described in the notes thereto) and fairly present in

(k) Solvency. Assuming (i) that the Company is Solvent immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) the satisfaction of all the conditions set forth in
Sections 6.01 and 6.03, and (iii) the accuracy and completeness of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3.01(e),
and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, the aggregate
Award Amounts, any financing by Parent, HandH Group, HandH Acquisition Sub, Sub or

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
payment of all related fees and expenses, each of Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub,
HandH Group and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective
Time immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent", when
used with respect to any person, means that, as of any date of determination:
(i) the sum of the debt (including contingent liabilities) of such person and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, does not exceed the present fair saleable
value of the present assets of such person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; (ii) the capital of such person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
is not unreasonably small in relation to the business of such person and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and (iii) such person and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, do not intend to incur, or believe that they will incur,
debts including current obligations beyond their ability to pay such debts as
they mature in the ordinary course of business. For the purposes hereof, the
amount of any contingent liability at any time shall be computed as the amount
that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances existing at such time,
represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or
matured liability (irrespective of whether such contingent liabilities meet
the criteria for accrual under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
5).

  

  

(l) SEC Reports and Financial Statements.

  

  

(i) Since December 31, 2013, Parent has filed with or otherwise transmitted to
the SEC all material forms, statements, schedules, reports or other documents
(including exhibits and all information incorporated by reference therein)
required to be filed or furnished by Parent with or to the SEC, as the case
may be (the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates, or, if
amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of the last such amendment,
the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder and none of
the Parent SEC Documents at the time it was filed, or, if amended prior to the
date hereof, as of the date of the last such amendment, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of
Parent is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act
or is otherwise required to file any forms, documents, statements,
certifications or reports with the SEC. As of the date hereof, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC by
Parent. To the Knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Documents are the
subject of ongoing SEC review, outstanding SEC comment or outstanding SEC
investigation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) The consolidated financial statements of Parent, including the notes and
schedules thereto included in the Parent SEC Documents (the "Parent Financial
Statements"), were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved and fairly presented in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of Parent's operations and cash flows for the periods indicated (subject to,
in the case of unaudited statements, normal and recurring year-end audit
adjustments and to the absence of footnote disclosures). All of Parent's
significant Subsidiaries are consolidated for accounting purposes. Since
December 31, 2013, there has been no material change in Parent's accounting
policies except as described in the notes to the Parent Financial Statements.

  

  

(iii) Parent maintains, and at all times since December 31, 2013 has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (A)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent; (B)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of Parent; and (C) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of Parent that could have a
material effect on the Parent Financial Statements. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) reasonably designed to provide reasonable
assurance that all material information required to be disclosed by Parent in
the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to Parent's management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since
December 31, 2013, neither Parent's independent registered accountant nor
Parent's principal executive officer or principal financial officer, based on
their evaluation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) Exchange Act), has identified or been made
aware of: (x) any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting utilized by Parent or
(y) fraud or suspected fraud involving management of Parent or involving
employees of Parent who have significant roles in internal control, whether or
not perceived to have a material effect on the Parent's consolidated financial
statements, or involving others where the fraud could have a material effect
on the Parent's consolidated financial statements.

(p) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as otherwise disclosed in the
Parent SEC Documents, between September 30, 2014 and the date of this
Agreement (with all dates inclusive), (a) no events have occurred which have
had or would be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (b) Parent, HandH Group, HandH Acquisition Sub,
Sub and their respective Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of business, and
(c) there has been no: (i) declaration, setting aside or payment of any
dividend or other distribution in respect of the capital stock of Parent; (ii)
redemption or other acquisition by Parent of any of its capital stock; (iii)
stock split, reverse stock split, combination or reclassification of the
shares of Parent's capital stock; (iv) change by Parent in its accounting
methods, principles or practices (including any change in depreciation or
amortization policies or rates or revenue recognition policies), except as
required by either Law or GAAP; (v) material revaluation by Parent of any of
its material assets, excluding writing-off or discounting of notes, accounts
receivable or other assets in the ordinary course of business; or (vi) any
agreement or commitment, whether in writing or otherwise, to take any action
described in clauses (i) through (v) above.

  

  

(q) Intentionally Omitted.

  

  

(r) No Vote Required. No vote is required by the holders of any class or
series of Parent's or HandH Group's capital stock or any membership or other
interests of HandH Acquisition Sub or Sub (except for the approval of HandH
Acquisition Sub as the sole member of Sub, which has been obtained prior to
the date hereof; a copy of such approval has been delivered to the Company on
or before the date hereof in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to
approve and adopt this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby under
applicable Law or pursuant to the rules of NASDAQ or any other national
securities exchange as a result of, or to consummate, this Agreement, the
Voting Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  

  

(s) Intentionally Omitted.

  

  

(t) Takeover Statutes. The Board of Directors of Parent has taken such actions
and votes as are necessary to render the provisions of any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or any other takeover or anti-
takeover statute or similar federal or state Law, including Section 203 of
Delaware Law, inapplicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger
and any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting
Agreement.

  

  

(u) Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Budgets,
Forward-Looking Statements and Business Plans. In connection with the due
diligence investigation of the Company by Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH
Group and Sub, Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub have received
and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as certain business
plan and budget information, regarding the Company and its business and
operations. Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub hereby acknowledge
that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in
such business plans and budgets, with which Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH
Group and Sub are familiar, that Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and
Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as such business plans and budgets, so
furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or
business plans or budgets), and that Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group
and Sub have not relied on such information or any other representation or
warranty not set forth in Section 3.01 and will have no claim against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective stockholders,
Affiliates or Representatives, for any failure to achieve any such estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(v) No Other Representations and Warranties. Except for the representations
and warranties made by Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub in this
Section 3.02, none of Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, Sub, or any
other person makes any express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, Sub or their respective
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities,
condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects.

SECTION 4.02. Competing Proposals. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, during the period beginning on the date
of this Agreement and continuing until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the
day that is thirty (30) days following the date of this Agreement (the
"Solicitation Period End Date"), the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives shall have the right (acting under the direction of
the Company Board or any committee thereof, including the Special Committee)
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate and encourage
any Competing Proposals, including by way of providing access to non-public
information pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more confidentiality
agreements having terms and provisions that are substantially similar to those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, provided, that, for avoidance of
doubt, such confidentiality agreement need not include any standstill
restriction (each, an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"); provided,
however, that, subject to the last sentence of this Section 4.02(a), any
material non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
provided to any Third Party and not previously provided or made available to
HandH Group shall be provided to HandH Group or Sub as promptly as reasonably
practicable after it is provided to such Third Party (which requirement may be
satisfied by posting such information to the Electronic Data Room); and (ii)
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with respect to any Competing Proposal or otherwise cooperate
with or assist or participate in or facilitate any such discussions or
negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any Competing Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide
any commercially sensitive non-public information to any competitor in
connection with the actions contemplated by this Section 4.02, except in a
manner consistent with the Company's past practice in dealing with the
disclosure of such information in the context of considering Competing
Proposals prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 4.02(b) or Section 4.02(c),
from and after the Solicitation Period End Date, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each of its Representatives to (i) cease and cause to be
terminated any existing solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation
with any Third Parties that may be ongoing with respect to a Competing
Proposal, and (ii) request any such Third Party to promptly return or destroy
all confidential information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Except as expressly permitted by this Section 4.02(b) or Section 4.02(c),
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its Representatives not to,
from and after the Solicitation Period End Date until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.01, directly or indirectly, (x) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, discussion, offer or
request that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Competing Proposal, (y) engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or
furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, or afford access to the books or records of the Company or
its Subsidiaries to, any Third Party for the purpose of knowingly facilitating
or knowingly encouraging a Competing Proposal, or (z) approve, endorse or
recommend, or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar
definitive agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement in a form
customary for acquisition transactions) with respect to, any Competing
Proposal (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"). No later than two (2)
business days following the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall
notify HandH Group and Sub in writing of the number and identity (to the extent
the Company is permitted under any contractual obligations and under
applicable Law to disclose the identity, and if not permissible, shall include
a general description (i.e., a financial buyer or a strategic buyer in lieu of
the identity)) of Exempted Persons that submitted a Competing Proposal on or
before the Solicitation Period End Date; provided, that in no event shall the
Company be required to disclose the identity of an Exempted Person if the
Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with such Exempted Person
prior to the date hereof. Notwithstanding the commencement of the obligations
of the Company under this Section 4.02(b), from and after the Solicitation
Period End Date, the Company may continue to engage in the activities
described in clauses (x) through (y) of this Section 4.02(b) above with
respect to a Competing Proposal submitted by an Exempted Person on or before
the Solicitation Period End Date until 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the day
that is fifteen (15) days following the Solicitation Period End Date (the
"Cut-Off Date"), including with respect to any amended or revised proposal
submitted by such Exempted Person on or before the Cut-Off Date, so long as a
majority of the members of the Company Board (or any committee thereof,
including the Special Committee) determine, in good faith, after consultation
with its financial and legal advisors, that such amended or revised proposal
is bona fide and constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior
Proposal. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 4.02(b) to the
contrary, an Exempted Person will no longer be an Exempted Person for all
purposes under this Agreement immediately at such time as (x) the Competing
Proposal made by such Exempted Person is withdrawn, is terminated, expires or
the Competing Proposal of such Exempted Person fails to satisfy the
requirements contained in the definition of "Exempted Person", subject, in
each case, to the right of the Exempted Person to amend, change or otherwise
modify its Competing Proposal, including to satisfy the requirements contained
in the definition of "Exempted Person", or (y) the discussions or negotiations
with such Exempted Person have been finally terminated by the Company or
finally terminated by the Exempted Person. The Company shall notify HandH Group
promptly when an Exempted Person ceases to be an Exempted Person; provided,
however, that the Company shall only be required to disclose the identity of
such Person who ceases to be an Exempted Person to the extent permissible
under any contractual obligations and under applicable Law, and if not
permissible, the Company shall provide Parent with a general description of
the Exempted Person (i.e., a financial buyer or a strategic buyer in lieu of
the identity); provided, further, that in no event shall the Company be
required to disclose the identity of an Exempted Person if the Company entered
into a confidentiality agreement with such Exempted Person prior to the date
hereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4.02(b)
(other than with respect to an Exempted Person in accordance with Section
4.02(b) during the period after the Solicitation Period End Date but prior to
the Cut-Off Date), at any time after the Solicitation Period End Date (or the
Cut-Off Date, as applicable) and prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approvals,
the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof, including the
Special Committee), directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may
(i) furnish nonpublic information to any Third Party making a Competing
Proposal (provided, however, that prior to so furnishing such information, the
Company receives from the Third Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; and provided, further, that, subject to the last sentence of
Section 4.02(a), any material non-public information concerning the Company or
its Subsidiaries provided to such Third Party and not already provided or made
available to HandH Group shall be provided to HandH Group or Sub as promptly as
reasonably practicable after it is provided to such Third Party (which
requirement may be satisfied by posting such information to the Electronic
Data Room)), and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Third
Party with respect to the Competing Proposal if: (x) such Third Party has
submitted a Competing Proposal and which a majority of the members of the
Company Board (or any committee thereof, including the Special Committee)
determine in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal
advisors, constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal; (y) such Competing Proposal did not result from a material breach of
either of the first two (2) sentences of Section 4.02(b); and (z) a majority
of the members of the Company Board (or any committee thereof, including the
Special Committee) determine in good faith, after consultation with legal
counsel, that failure to take such action could be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Prior to taking any of the
actions referred to in this Section 4.02(c), the Company shall notify HandH
Group and Sub orally and in writing that it proposes to furnish non-public
information and/or enter into discussions or negotiations as provided in this
Section 4.02(c).

  

  

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 4.02(d), neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall: (i) withdraw or modify, or publicly
propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, HandH Acquisition
Sub, HandH Group or Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or
any such committee, including the Special Committee, of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, any Competing Proposal made or received after
the date hereof (any of the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this
Section 4.02(d), an "Adverse Recommendation Change"); or (iii) cause or permit
the Company to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any
time prior to the Stockholder Approvals, a majority of the members of the
Company Board (or any committee thereof, including the Special Committee)
shall be permitted (x) to terminate this Agreement to substantially
concurrently enter into a definitive agreement, and/or effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change described in clause (i) of such definition, with respect
to a Superior Proposal, subject to compliance in all material respects with
Section 4.02(e) and, if applicable, Section 7.05 (A) if the Company Board (or
any committee thereof, including the Special Committee) has received a
Competing Proposal that, in the good faith determination of a majority of the
members of the Company Board (or any committee thereof, including the Special
Committee), after consultation with its legal and financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having complied with, and giving effect
to all of the adjustments which may be timely offered in writing by Parent,
HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub pursuant to Section 4.02(e), (B) such
Competing Proposal did not result from a material breach of either of the
first two (2) sentences of Section 4.02(b), and (C) if a majority of the
members of the Company Board (or any committee thereof, including the Special
Committee) determine in good faith, after consultation with its financial and
legal advisors, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
or (y) to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change described in clause (i) of
such definition, if a majority of the members of the Company Board (or any
committee thereof, including the Special Committee) determine in good faith,
after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that, in light of
material facts, events, developments or circumstances that were not known by
or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board prior to the date hereof, or if
known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board prior to the date of this
Agreement, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable
to the Company Board prior to the date of this Agreement, other than a
Competing Proposal, or an inquiry, proposal or offer that could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Competing Proposal, or the consequences thereof (an
"Intervening Event"), the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) The Company shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change with respect to a Competing Proposal that the Company Board (or any
committee thereof, including the Special Committee) has determined is a
Superior Proposal or to terminate this Agreement as permitted under Section
4.02(d) with respect to a Competing Proposal that the Company Board (or any
committee thereof, including the Special Committee) has determined is a
Superior Proposal unless (i) with respect to such Competing Proposal, the
Company has complied with the terms of this Section 4.02(e) in all material
respects and such Superior Proposal did not result from a material breach of
either of the first two (2) sentences of Section 4.02(b), (ii) the Company has
provided a written notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") to Parent, HandH
Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub that the Company intends to take such
action and describing the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal that is the basis of such action (including copies of any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement and, to the extent permissible under any contractual
obligations of the Company and under applicable Law, the identity of the Third
Party; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company be required to
disclose the identity of any Third Party if the Company entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such Third Party prior to the date hereof, and
if not permissible, the Company shall disclose to Parent a general description
of the Third Party (i.e., a financial buyer or a strategic buyer in lieu of
the identity), (iii) during the four (4) business day period following
Parent's, HandH Acquisition Sub's, HandH Group's and Sub's receipt of the Notice
of Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub,
HandH Group and Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub,
HandH Group and Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal; and (iv) following the end of the four (4)
business day period, a majority of the members of the Company Board (or any
committee thereof, including the Special Committee) shall have determined in
good faith, taking into account any changes to this Agreement timely proposed
in writing by Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub in response to
the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, and after consultation with its
legal and financial advisors, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the
Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any
material amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the
Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
Section 4.02(e); provided, however, that references to the four (4) business
day period above shall be deemed to be references to a three (3) business day
period).

  

  

(f) The Company shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to clause (y) under Section 4.02(d) with respect to an
Intervening Event unless (i) the Company has provided a written notice (a
"Notice of Intervening Event") to Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and
Sub that the Company intends to take such action and describing in reasonable
detail the underlying facts giving rise to the Intervening Event and the
reasons for taking such action, (ii) during the four (4) business day period
following Parent's, HandH Acquisition Sub's, HandH Group's and Sub's receipt of
the Notice of Intervening Event, the Company shall, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent, HandH
Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent, HandH
Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the need for
making an Adverse Recommendation Change is obviated; and (iii) following the
end of the four (4) business day period, a majority of the members of the
Company Board (or any committee thereof, including the Special Committee)
shall have determined in good faith, taking into account any changes to this
Agreement timely proposed in writing by Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group
and Sub in response to the Notice of Intervening Event or otherwise, and after
consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that the need for making
an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of an Intervening Event is not
obviated. Any material developments relating to an Intervening Event shall
require a new Notice of Intervening and the Company shall be required to
comply again with the requirements of this Section 4.02(f); provided, however,
that references to the four (4) business day period above shall be deemed to
be references to a three (3) business day period).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) From and after the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2) business
days), advise Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub of receipt by the
Company of any Competing Proposal or any request for non-public information,
or for discussions or negotiations, in connection with any Competing Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of any such Competing Proposal or request
(including, to the extent permissible under any contractual obligations of the
Company and under applicable Law, the identity of the Third Party, and if not
permissible, the Company shall disclose to Parent a general description of the
Third Party (i.e., a financial buyer or a strategic buyer in lieu of the
identity), and a copy of the Competing Proposal; provided, however, that in no
event shall the Company be required to disclose the identity of any Third
Party if the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with such Third
Party prior to the date hereof). The Company shall keep Parent, HandH
Acquisition Sub and HandH Group reasonably informed on a reasonably current
basis (but in no event later than two (2) business days) after the occurrence
of any material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations of the
status of any Competing Proposal and any material developments, discussions or
negotiations related thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2)
business days) advise Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub of any
material amendments to any such Competing Proposal or request. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary or otherwise, in no event shall
Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, Sub or any of their respective
Representatives or Affiliates, and Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and
Sub shall cause their respective Representatives and Affiliates not to, and
neither, Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, Sub nor their respective
Representatives or Affiliates shall instruct or encourage any person to,
directly or indirectly, contact by any means, whether in-person, by telephone,
facsimile, electronic mail, written or otherwise, any Exempted Person or any
Third Party that has submitted or, to the Knowledge of Parent, HandH Acquisition
Sub, HandH Group or Sub, intends to submit to the Company or its Representatives
a Competing Proposal, or made or, to the Knowledge of Parent, HandH Acquisition
Sub, HandH Group or Sub, intends to make a request for non-public information,
or engaged or, to the Knowledge of Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group or
Sub, intends to engage in discussions or negotiations, in connection with any
Competing Proposal or any request for non-public information; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit contact with any Exempted
Person or Third Party not related to any Competing Proposal, the Company, any
of the Company's Subsidiaries or the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
respective businesses.

  

  

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i)
taking and disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position with respect to
a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Company's stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Company's stockholders) if a majority of the members of the Company Board (or
any committee thereof, including the Special Committee) has determined in good
faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that the failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; provided, however, that any disclosures permitted under
this Section 4.02(g) shall not be a basis, in themselves, for HandH Group to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(e).

  

  

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Competing Proposal" shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any bona fide, written proposal, inquiry or offer (other
than a proposal, inquiry or offer by Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group,
Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries) from a Third Party relating to
(i) a merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation, joint
venture or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty
percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company as determined
on a book-value basis; (ii) the acquisition (whether by merger, consolidation,
equity investment, joint venture or otherwise) by any person of twenty percent
(20%) or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole as determined on a book-value basis; (iii) the acquisition in any
manner, directly or indirectly, by any person of twenty percent (20%) or more
of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock; or (iv) any
purchase, acquisition, tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in any person beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of
the Company Common Stock or any class of equity or voting securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets
of the Company as determined on a book-value basis.

  

  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean a Competing Proposal (with all percentages
in the definition of Competing Proposal increased to fifty percent (50%)) made
by a Third Party not resulting from a material breach by the Company of the
first two sentences of Section 4.02(b) on terms that a majority of the members
of the Company Board (or any committee thereof, including the Special
Committee) determine in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
financial and legal advisors, and considering such factors as the Company
Board (or any committee thereof, including the Special Committee) considers to
be appropriate, which shall include the legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of the Competing Proposal (including financing terms, the
conditionality thereof, the representations and warranties required to be made
by the Company and the expected timing and likelihood of consummation of such
Competing Proposal) to the extent required by applicable Law and the person
making the proposal, are more favorable, including from a financial point of
view, to the Company and its stockholders than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (after giving effect to all adjustments to the terms thereof
which may be timely offered in writing by Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub or HandH
Group (including pursuant to Section 4.02(e), if applicable).

anything to the contrary set forth herein, neither the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives shall be required to
provide access to or disclose any information regarding or in connection with

proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Authority; (iii) execute and
deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) defend or contest any claim, suit,
action or other proceeding that would otherwise prevent or materially impede,
interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In connection with and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and the Company
Board shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover
statute is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state
takeover statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Additionally, each of Parent, HandH
Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective Affiliates
to, take any action that would, or that would reasonably be expected to,
result in any of the conditions set forth in Article VI not being satisfied in
a timely manner.

  

  

SECTION 5.04. Antitrust Notification and Other Regulatory Filings. (a) Parent,
HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, Sub and the Company shall, in consultation and
cooperation with the other and as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in
no event later than ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement,
file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the
United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") the notification and report
form, if any, required under the HSR Act for the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any such filings shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each of Parent,
HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, Sub and the Company shall (i) furnish to the
other party such necessary information that is required by applicable Law to
be included in, and reasonable assistance as the other party may request in
connection with its preparation of, any initial filing or initial submission
which is necessary under the HSR Act, (ii) give the other party reasonable
prior notice of any such filings or submissions and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, of any communication with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other Governmental
Authority regarding the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and permit the other party to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of, and secure the participation
of, the other party in connection with, any such filings, submissions,
communications, requests or inquiries, (iii) unless prohibited by applicable
Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority, and to the extent reasonably
practicable, (A) not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in any
substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the other party, (B) give the other party reasonable prior notice of any such
meeting or conversation, (C) in the event one party is prohibited by
applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority from participating
or attending any such meeting or engaging in any such conversation, keep such
party apprised with respect thereto to the extent permitted by applicable Law
or by the applicable Governmental Authority, (D) cooperate in the filing of
any substantive memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence or other
written communications explaining or defending this Agreement, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, articulating any
regulatory or competitive argument or responding to requests or objections
made by any Governmental Authority and (E) furnish the other party with copies
of all filings, submissions, correspondence and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of any Governmental Authority's staff, on the other hand, with respect
to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iv) comply with any inquiry or request from the FTC, the DOJ or
any other Governmental Authority as promptly as reasonably practicable. Any
such additional information shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act. Each of Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group
and Sub agrees not to extend, directly or indirectly, any waiting period under
the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with a Governmental Authority to delay
or not to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the Company, which
consent may be withheld in its sole discretion. Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub
and HandH Group, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall each
pay one-half (1/2) of the initial fee related to the filings required pursuant
to the HSR Act.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Each of Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, Sub and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable, (i)
obtain any clearance required, including pursuant to a request for an early
termination of any waiting period, (ii) resolve any objections as may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority and (iii) avoid or eliminate
impediments, in each case, under the HSR Act and any other applicable merger
control or competition Law that would otherwise prevent the consummation of
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
For purposes of this Section 5.04, Parent's, HandH Acquisition Sub's, HandH
Group's and Sub's reasonable best efforts shall include (i) vigorously
defending and contesting any claim, suit, action or other proceeding
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as illegal under or
violative of any competition or antitrust Law, (ii) attempting to have
repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable any Law or Restraint, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Law that is enacted, entered,
promulgated or enforced by a Governmental Authority, that would make the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal
or would otherwise prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or
delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of businesses, product lines, assets or operations
of Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, Sub, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (iv) conducting its business in a specified manner,
or proposing and agreeing or permitting Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH
Group, Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to conduct its
business in a specified manner and (v) otherwise taking or committing to take
actions that after the Effective Time would limit Parent's, HandH Acquisition
Sub's, HandH Group's, Sub's or their respective Subsidiaries' ability to retain
one or more of the businesses, product lines, assets or operations of the
Company, in each case, to the extent necessary to obtain any such clearance,
resolve any such objections or avoid or eliminate any such impediments;
provided, however, that the effectiveness of any such action shall be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent, including as reasonably requested by Parent, directly
in connection with the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence of this Section 5.04(b), provided, however,
that other than such information that is necessary to reply to any second
request for information made by the FTC or DOJ, in no other event shall the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives be
required to provide access to or disclose any information regarding or in
connection with the Company or its Subsidiaries, or their respective
businesses to Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group or Sub, or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives.

  

  

SECTION 5.05. Benefit Matters. (a)Parent agrees that each employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who continues employment with Parent, HandH
Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries after the Merger Closing Date (each, a "Continuing
Employee") shall be provided with benefits on substantially the same terms as
benefits are provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. Nothing in
this Agreement shall require Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to continue to employ any
particular employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Merger Closing Date, or shall be construed to prohibit Parent, HandH Acquisition
Sub, HandH Group, Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries from
amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan.

  

  

(b) Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and the Surviving Corporation shall
ensure that, as of the Merger Closing Date, each Continuing Employee receives
full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to participate, vesting,
vacation entitlement and severance benefits) for service with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company
provides such past service credit under its employee benefit plans) under each
of the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary, as applicable, in which such
Continuing Employee becomes a participant; provided, however, that no such
service recognition shall result in any duplication of benefits. As of the
Merger Closing Date, Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub and HandH Group shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or relevant Subsidiary to, credit to each
Continuing Employee the amount of vacation time that such employee had accrued
under any applicable Company Benefit Plan as of the Merger Closing Date. With
respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary for the benefit of any
Continuing Employee, Parent shall (i) cause to be waived any eligibility
waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the application
of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan, and (ii) cause each
Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by
such Continuing Employee under any similar Company Benefit Plan for the plan
year that includes the Merger Closing Date for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable plan
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary, as
applicable, for the plan year in which the Merger Closing Date occurs.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub and HandH Group shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or relevant Subsidiary to, assume and honor in
accordance with their terms all deferred compensation agreements, severance
agreements and written employment, severance, retention, incentive, change in
control and termination agreements (including any change in control provisions
therein) set forth in Section 3.01(l)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter
applicable to employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in the same
manner and to the same extent that the Company or such Subsidiary would be
required to perform and honor such plans, agreements and arrangements if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement had not been consummated.

  

  

SECTION 5.06. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a) All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any person who is or prior
to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a
fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (each, an "Indemnified
Party") as provided in the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company
By-Laws, the organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any
right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

  

  

(b) Without limiting Section 5.06(a) or any rights of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after the Effective Time,
in the event of any threatened or actual claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (a "Claim"), whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director (including in a
capacity as a member of any board committee), officer, employee or agent of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors
or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, Parent,
HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly
and severally, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent that the
Company would be permitted to do so under applicable Law (for the avoidance of
doubt, subject to the limitations on the Company's ability to indemnify its
directors and officers under Section 145 of the DGCL), each such Indemnified
Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law upon receipt of any
undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or
actual Claim. Neither Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification could be sought by
an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in
writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Parent, HandH Acquisition
Sub, HandH Group and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with an
Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified
Party could seek indemnification hereunder. Parent's, HandH Acquisition Sub's,
HandH Group's and the Surviving Corporation's obligations under this Section
5.06(b) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification
in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such period shall continue
until the final disposition of such Claim.

  

  

(c) The Company may obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or
"tail") directors' and officers' liability insurance policies in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) for six (6)
years from the Effective Time, covering each person who is covered by such
policies on the date of this Agreement on terms with respect to such coverage
and amounts that are, individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to
any Indemnified Party than those of such policies in effect on the date of
this Agreement; provided, however, that the maximum aggregate premium for such
insurance policies shall not exceed the maximum aggregate annual premium
contemplated by the second succeeding sentence. If such "tail" insurance
policies have been obtained by the Company, Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub and
HandH Group shall cause such policies to be maintained in full force and effect,
for their full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by it
and the Surviving Corporation. In the event the Company does not obtain such
"tail" insurance policies, then, for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time, Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub and HandH Group shall maintain in
effect the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby), covering each Indemnified Party on terms with respect to
such coverage and amounts that are, individually and in the aggregate, no less
favorable to any Indemnified Party than those of such policies in effect on
the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that neither Parent, HandH
Acquisition Sub, HandH Group nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to
pay an aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies in excess of two
hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium paid by the Company for
coverage for its last full fiscal year for such insurance (which amount the
Company represents and warrants is set forth in Section 5.06(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter); provided further that if the annual premium of such
insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group
or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount; and provided
further that Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub and HandH Group may substitute therefor
policies of a reputable and financially sound insurance company containing
terms, including with respect to coverage and amounts, that are, individually
and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified Party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) In the event that Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, including any internal
reorganization or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of
its properties and other assets to any person, or if Parent, HandH Acquisition
Sub, or HandH Group dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such
case, Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub and HandH Group shall cause proper provision
to be made so that the applicable successors and assigns or transferees
expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.06.

  

  

(e) The obligations of Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and the
Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.06 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom
this Section 5.06 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified
Party. The provisions of this Section 5.06 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by contract or otherwise.

SECTION 5.07. Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.04,
this Section 5.07, Section 5.15 and Section 7.05, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5.07, if
any legal proceeding, arbitration or other action is brought or threatened for
the enforcement or interpretation of this Agreement, or because of any alleged
dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in connection with any of the
provisions of this Agreement, and the prevailing party in any such action
should incur any legal fees or costs, including, but not limited to,
attorneys' fees, paralegal fees, expert witness fees, court costs and other
similar fees and costs, a successful prevailing party or parties to any such
dispute or action shall be entitled to recover from the other party their
reasonable legal fees or costs, including, but not limited to, attorneys'
fees, paralegal fees, expert witness fees, court costs and other similar fees
and costs, incurred, together with any other relief to which it may otherwise
be entitled, as determined by an arbitrator, judgment at trial, upon appeal or
petition.

  

  

SECTION 5.08. Public Announcements. HandH Group and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court
process or the rules and regulations of any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system and except for any matters referred to in
Section 4.02. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

  

  

SECTION 5.09. Tender Offer. Prior to the end of the date hereof, Parent shall,
and shall cause HandH Group, HandH Acquisition Sub and Sub to, and each of HandH
Group, HandH Acquisition Sub and Sub shall, irrevocably withdraw the tender
offer launched on February 26, 2015, as thereafter extended, pursuant to that
certain Offer to Purchase whereby Parent, through its Affiliates, offered to
purchase 10,028,724 shares of Company Common Stock.

  

  

SECTION 5.10. Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
written notice to HandH Group, and HandH Group shall give prompt written notice to
the Company, upon becoming aware of any material event, development or
occurrence that would reasonably be expected to give rise to the failure of
any conditions set forth in Article VI or a right of termination set forth in
Section 7.01(c) or Section 7.01(d), as the case may be, and that is incapable
of being remedied prior to the Outside Date.

  

  

SECTION 5.11. Sub and Surviving Corporation Compliance. HandH Acquisition Sub
shall cause Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, and Parent shall
cause HandH Group, and HandH Group shall cause HandH Acquisition Sub, to perform all
of its respective covenants and agreements and to comply with all of its
respective obligations, in each case, under this Agreement and Sub shall not
engage in any activities of any nature except as provided in or contemplated
by this Agreement.

shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to vote, all shares of Company
Common Stock owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in
accordance with the Recommendation or any Adverse Recommendation Change, and,
if applicable, in favor of any Superior Proposal recommended by the Company
Board or the Special Committee, in each case that is made or accepted pursuant
to, and in material compliance with, Sections 4.02(d), (e) and (f), as
applicable.

  

  

SECTION 5.13. Release. Notwithstanding anything contained herein (or
otherwise) to the contrary, in consideration of the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement, effective as of the Effective
Time, each of the Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub on behalf of
itself and each of their respective present and future Affiliates and past and
present Representatives (each, a "Releasing Party"), RELEASES, WAIVES,
ACQUITS, DISCLAIMS ANY RIGHT TO BENEFIT FROM, AND FOREVER DISCHARGES, and each
of Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub shall cause each of their
respective present and future Affiliates to RELEASE, WAIVE, ACQUIT, DISCLAIM
ANY RIGHT TO BENEFIT FROM, AND FOREVER DISCHARGE, the Company and its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates, together with each of
their respective past and present Representatives (each, a "Released Party"),
from any and all loss, liability, damage, claim, settlement or expense
(including any and all out-of pocket legal fees and expenses), causes of
action or suits in law or equity, of whatever kind or nature, known or
unknown, matured or un-matured, contingent or non-contingent, that any
Releasing Party ever had or may now have against any Released Party to the
extent related in any way to the Company and its Subsidiaries, including
without limitation those relating to the 2015 annual meeting of the
stockholders of the Company and the voting of Company Common Stock thereat,
and that have accrued or arisen prior to the Effective Time (or as of the
Effective Time or such later date as may be applicable solely with respect to
claims (other than Permitted Claims) relating to the shares of Company Common
Stock owned, of record or beneficially, by Steel or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates not being cancelled in the Merger pursuant to Section 2.01(c) in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration and instead being exchanged
following the Merger for shares of common stock of Parent), including without
limitation those based on any fact or circumstance arising from Parent's, HandH
Acquisition Sub's or HandH Group's past or current beneficial ownership, as
applicable, of any Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company
(including any claims relating to actual or alleged breaches of fiduciary or
other duties by the Company's or its Subsidiaries' directors, officers or
stockholders and any of their respective Representatives and any claims
relating to the shares of Company Common Stock owned, of record or
beneficially, by Steel or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates not being
cancelled in the Merger pursuant to Section 2.01(c) in exchange for the Per
Share Merger Consideration and instead being exchanged following the Merger
for shares of common stock of Parent), whether based on contract or any
applicable Law in any jurisdiction (collectively, the "Released Claims").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.13 shall be deemed to
release any rights or obligations of any Releasing Party pursuant to, subject
to or under the terms of this Agreement or in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated hereby (but for avoidance of doubt, any claim (other
than a Permitted Claim) relating to the shares of Company Common Stock owned,
of record or beneficially, by Steel or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
not being cancelled in the Merger pursuant to Section 2.01(c) in exchange for
the Per Share Merger Consideration shall not be deemed to be a claim arising
subject to, pursuant to or under the terms of this Agreement or in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated hereby). The terms and provisions of
this Section 5.13 constitute essential terms and provisions of this Agreement,
and the execution of this Agreement by Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group
and Sub shall constitute the express agreement of each such party and its
Affiliates to be bound by such terms and provisions. For purposes of this
Section 5.13, "Permitted Claim" means a claim relating to the shares of
Company Common Stock owned, of record or beneficially, by Steel or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates not being cancelled in the Merger pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration and instead
being exchanged following the Merger for shares of common stock of Parent that
is based on or arises out of (i) any statement (whether oral, written or
electronic) made by or at the direction of a Released Party made after the
Effective Time that slanders or libels Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or any of their respective businesses, or (ii) any unlawful conduct
after the Effective Time as a result of any agreement, arrangement,
understanding or relationship, including any repurchase or similar so-called
"stock borrowing" agreement or arrangement, entered into by or at the
direction of a Released Party the purpose or effect of which is to mitigate
loss to, reduce the economic risk (of ownership or otherwise) of shares of any
class or series of Parent by, manage the risk of share price changes for, or
increase or decrease the voting power of, such person with respect to any
shares of any class or series of Parent, or which provides, directly or
indirectly, the opportunity to profit from any decrease in the price or value
of any shares of any class or series of Parent. The provisions of this Section
5.13 are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Released Party, his, her or its heirs or successors and his, her or its
representatives.

SECTION 5.14. Waiver Concerning Unknown Claim. The parties hereto intend for
the release of claims provided hereunder to include unknown claims.
Accordingly, and after consulting with their counsel, the Releasing Parties
waive any and all claims under or rights related to California Civil Code
Section 1542 (or any other similar law), which provides that:

  

  

"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know
or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release,
which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her
settlement with the debtor."

  

  

SECTION 5.15. Covenant Not to Sue. Effective as of the Effective Time, each
Releasing Party hereby agrees not to sue and agrees that it and they will
never assert, file, initiate, pursue, encourage, support, assist or join in
any action, suit, claim, proceeding, arbitration, cause of action, or demand
against any Released Party (i) relating to any of the Released Claims, or (ii)
for document requests, interrogatories or other discovery relating to the
Released Claims. Prior to the Merger Closing, the parties hereto will, and
will cause their Affiliates to, dismiss any and all pending litigation against
any other parties hereto or against any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives, including Steel Partners Holdings, L.P. v, Robert J. Capozzi,
Alan B. Howe, WM. Ellis Jackson, Mikel H. Williams and JPS Industries, Inc.,
C.A. No. 10583-VCG and Robert J. Capozzi and Alan B. Howe v. Jack L. Howard
and John J. Quicke, C.A. No. 10431-VCG.

  

  

SECTION 5.16. Non-Circumvention. Each of the Company, Parent, HandH Acquisition
Sub, HandH Group and Sub hereby covenants and agrees that it will not, by any
voluntary action, or any inaction, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or
performance of any of the terms of this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, and
will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this
Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 5.17. FIRPTA Certificate. At or prior to the Merger Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to HandH Group a certificate substantially in the form of
the sample certification set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(c)(3)(i) that interests in the Company are not United States real
property interests.

  

  

SECTION 5.18. Standstill. Each of Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and
Sub hereby covenants and agrees that, for a period commencing on the date
hereof and ending on the earliest to occur of (i) the date that is thirty (30)
days after the completion of the next annual meeting of the Company after the
date of this Agreement, (ii) the valid termination of this Agreement by HandH
Group pursuant to Section 7.01(c); (iii) the valid termination of this
Agreement by HandH Group pursuant to Section 7.01(e)(i) or Section 7.01(e)(ii)
if, in the case of Section 7.01(e)(ii), the Competing Proposal that is the
subject of the Alternative Acquisition Agreement does not constitute a
Superior Proposal (which, for the avoidance of doubt, is not permitted by the
Company under the terms of this Agreement); (iv) if this Agreement has been
(x) validly terminated by HandH Group pursuant to Section 7.01(e)(ii) and the
Competing Proposal that is the subject of the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement constitutes a Superior Proposal or (y) validly terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f), the date that is thirty (30) days prior

one hundred fifty (150) days after the date hereof (as such date may be
extended pursuant to Section 7.01(c), Section 7.01(d) or Section 8.09, the

under this Section 7.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party if the
failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement,
its failure to act in good faith or its failure to use its reasonable best
efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including to the extent required by and subject to Section
5.03 and Section 5.04, has been a principal cause of or resulted in the
failure of the Merger Closing Date to occur on or before such date (it being
understood that Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, Sub and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives shall be deemed a single party for
purposes of the foregoing proviso);

  

  

(ii) if any Restraint shall be in effect enjoining or otherwise prohibiting

such Restraint in accordance with its obligations under this Agreement
(including Section 5.03 and Section 5.04) (it being understood that Parent,

Representatives shall be deemed a single party for purposes of the foregoing
proviso); or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) by HandH Group, if the Company shall have violated, breached or failed to

such twenty (20) business day period extends through the Outside Date, the
Outside Date shall be extended to the end of such twenty (20) business day
period) stating HandH Group's intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

shall not have violated, breached or failed to perform any of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which violation, breach or failure to perform has not been cured at

set forth in Section 6.01 or Section 6.02;

  

  

(d) by the Company, if Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group or Sub shall
have violated, breached or failed to perform any of its representations,

condition set forth in Section 6.01 or Section 6.02 and (B) has not been cured
within twenty (20) business days after the delivery of written notice by the
Company to HandH Group (provided, that if such twenty (20) business day period
extends through the Outside Date, the Outside Date shall be extended to the
end of such twenty (20) business day period) stating the Company's intention
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(d) and the basis for
such termination, but only so long as the Company shall not have violated,
breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which violation, breach
or failure to perform has not been cured at the time of such termination and
would result in the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.01 or
Section 6.03;

  

  

(e) by HandH Group prior to obtaining any of the Stockholder Approvals, (i) in
the event that an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred (whether
or not in compliance with Section 4.02), or (ii) if the Company enters into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement or if the Company publicly states that the
Company will enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement (whether or not
in compliance with Section 4.02);

  

  

(f) by the Company, if prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approvals, a
majority of the members of the Company Board (or a committee thereof,
including the Special Committee) determine to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 4.02(d) and
Section 4.02(e);

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) by HandH Group or the Company, in either case, no earlier than one (1) day
after the Stockholders' Meeting if the Aggregate Stockholder Approval shall
not have been obtained at the Stockholders' Meeting; provided, however, that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.01(g) shall not be
available to any party hereto if such party, or any of such party's Affiliates
or Representatives, fail to perform, breach or violate, in any material
respect, any of its or its Affiliates' or Representatives' obligations under
this Agreement, the Voting Agreement or the Affiliate Voting Agreement, as
applicable (it being understood that Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group
and Sub shall be deemed a single party for purposes of the foregoing proviso);
or

  

  

(h) by the Company no earlier than one (1) day after the date of the
Stockholders' Meeting if the Unaffiliated Stockholder Approval shall not have
been obtained at the Stockholders' Meeting.

  

  

SECTION 7.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of
Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, Sub or the Company, other than the
provisions of (a) the last sentence of Section 5.02 and (b) Section 5.07,
Section 5.18 (but only to the extent provided therein), Section 5.19 (but only
to the extent provided therein), this Section 7.02, Article VIII and the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of which shall survive such termination, and
except for any material and willful breach by a party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (which material and willful breach and liability therefor shall not
be affected by termination of this Agreement). For avoidance of doubt, if the
Effective Time occurs, Section 5.13, Section 5.14 and Section 5.15 shall
survive.

  

  

SECTION 7.03. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at any time before or
after receipt of the Stockholder Approvals (it being understood that Parent,
HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub shall be deemed a single party for
purposes of the this Section 7.03); provided, however, that after the
Stockholder Approvals have been obtained, there shall be no amendment that by
Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto (it being
understood that Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub shall be deemed
a single party for purposes of the this Section 7.03).

  

  

SECTION 7.04. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties, (b) to the extent permitted by Law, waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) subject to the proviso to the
first sentence of Section 7.03 and to the extent permitted by Law, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein (it being
understood that Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub shall be deemed
a single party for purposes of this Section 7.04); provided, in any such case,
that no such action shall be taken by the Company unless it is taken upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party (it being understood that
Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub shall be deemed a single party
for purposes of this Section 7.04). The failure of any party to this Agreement
to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

Committee), or publicly announced to the Company's stockholders by the person
making the Competing Proposal, before the Solicitation Period End Date (or, in
the case of an Exempt Person, before the Cut-Off Date), whether or not such
Competing Proposal is thereafter amended, modified or changed in any manner
after the Solicitation Period End Date (or, in the case of an Exempt Person,
after the Cut-Off Date), or (B) the Adverse Recommendation Change that results
in the action or event that forms the basis for the termination contemplated
by Section 7.05(a)(i)(A) is in connection with an Intervening Event, then the

for the termination contemplated by Section 7.05(b)(i)(A) is not made in
connection with a Competing Proposal or an Intervening Event (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, is not permitted by the Company under the terms of this
Agreement), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to HandH Group the
Post-Solicitation Period Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately
available funds (x) within two (2) business days after the termination date,

acceptance by HandH Group of any Termination Fee due under Section 7.05 shall
constitute acceptance by Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub of the
validity of any termination of this Agreement and acceptance by HandH Group of
any Termination Fee due under Section 7.05 shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group and Sub against the

SECTION 8.08. Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial. (a) This
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern
under any applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of the State of Delaware and to the jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the State of Delaware, for the purpose of any action, suit
or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
actions of Parent, HandH Acquisition Sub, HandH Group, Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware
state or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any
other court of the State of Delaware and any Federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware in the event any action, suit or other proceeding arises out
of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (iii) irrevocably consents to the service of process in any action,
suit or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on
behalf of itself or its property, by U.S. registered mail to such party's
respective address set forth above, and nothing in this Section 8.08 shall
affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law and (iv) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any other court of the
State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware). The
parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action, suit or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law; provided,
however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any party's rights to
seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial
court judgment.

  

  

(b) Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party
hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in
the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waiver
and certifications in this Section 8.08(b).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 8.09. Remedies. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions, or any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, in each case, in
accordance with Section 8.08, without proof of damages or otherwise (and each
party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at law or in equity.
The parties agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. If,
prior to the Outside Date, any party brings any action, in each case, in
accordance with Section 8.08 or the corresponding provision in the Voting
Agreement or the Affiliate Voting Agreement, to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement or the Affiliate Voting Agreement by any other party hereto or
thereto, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the amount of
time during which such action is pending, plus twenty (20) business days or
(y) such other time period established by the court presiding over such
action, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company
breaches this Agreement (including if either the Company Board or any
committee thereof shall make an Adverse Recommendation Change not in
connection with a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, and
notwithstanding such Adverse Recommendation Change, the Stockholder Approvals
are obtained) HandH Group may seek specific performance as provided in this
Section 8.09; provided, however, that if a court of competent jurisdiction
grants such request for specific performance and the Merger Closing occurs
none of Parent, HandH Group, HandH Acquisition Sub or Sub shall be entitled to
receive the Post-Solicitation Period Termination Fee or the Solicitation
Period Termination Fee.

  

  

SECTION 8.10. Severability. If any term, condition or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such
determination that any term, condition or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.
