conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding
share of Company Common Shares (such Company Common Shares issued and
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, collectively, "Shares"),
other than Shares owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiaries of Parent and any shares of Company Common Shares held in the
treasury of the Company, will be converted into the right to receive the

than any condition that by its nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing,
but subject to satisfaction or waiver of any such condition) set forth in
Article VII or on such other date as is mutually agreeable in writing to the
parties to this Agreement; provided, however, that if the Marketing Period
(such term, and all other capitalized terms as defined in Section 10.2) has

(other than any condition that by its nature cannot be satisfied until the
Closing, but subject to satisfaction or waiver of any such condition) set
forth in Article VII, the Closing shall occur on the earlier to occur of (a) a
date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no less than three
Business Days' notice to the Company and (b) the third Business Day
immediately following the final day of the Marketing Period (subject in each
case to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions (other than any
condition that by its nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but
subject to satisfaction or waiver of any such condition) set forth in Article
VII for the Closing as of the date determined pursuant to this proviso), or
such other date, time, or place as agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.
The date on which the Closing will occur is the "Closing Date".

Section 1.3 Effective Time. The parties to this Agreement will cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger ("Certificate of
Merger") on the Closing Date (or on such other date as Parent and the Company
may agree in writing) with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the OGCL and the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
DGCL. The date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Ohio and the Secretary of the State of the
State of Delaware, or such later time as is specified in the Certificate of
Merger pursuant to a written agreement between Parent and the Company, is the

Section 1.4 Effect of the Merger. The Merger will have the effects set forth
in this Agreement and the relevant provisions of the OGCL and the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,

Corporation. (a) At the Effective Time, the second amended and restated
articles of incorporation of the Company ("Articles of Incorporation") will be

6.7.



CLI-202375011v3 

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the amended and restated code of regulations of the
Company ("Code of Regulations") will be amended so as to read in their

of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of the Company
immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case until their successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the articles of incorporation and the code of regulations
of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.7 Subsequent Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub vested in or to be
vested in the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the
Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and directors of
the Surviving Corporation are authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf
of each such corporation or otherwise, all such other actions and things as
may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the

ARTICLE II 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of Shares or securities of Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time
(other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(b)) will be
cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the right to receive $28.75
in cash, without interest, payable to the holder of each Share ("Merger
Consideration") upon surrender of either certificates formerly representing
such Shares ("Certificates") or any book-entry Shares ("Book-Entry Shares") in
the manner provided in Section 2.2. All such Shares, when so converted, will
no longer be outstanding and will be automatically cancelled, retired and
cease to exist. Each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares



CLI-202375011v3 

will cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration for such Shares upon the surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.2, without
interest.

(b) Each (i) Share held in the treasury of the Company, (ii) Share owned by
Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately
before the Effective Time, and (iii) Dissenting Share will be cancelled and
extinguished, and no payment or other consideration will be made with respect
to such shares subject, in the case of Dissenting Shares, to the right of the
holder thereof to receive any payment under Section 2.4.

(c) Each share of common stock, no par value per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will thereafter
represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.2 Payment; Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books.

(a) Before the Effective Time, Parent will enter into an agreement with the
Company's transfer agent to act as agent for the holders of Shares in
connection with the Merger ("Paying Agent") to receive the funds necessary to
make the payments contemplated by Section 2.1(a). At or immediately before the
Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust with
the Paying Agent in a separate account for the benefit of holders of Shares
("Payment Fund") the aggregate Merger Consideration to which such holders are
entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.1(a). The paying agent
agreement pursuant to which Parent will appoint the Paying Agent will be in a
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company.

(b) (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event within three Business Days thereafter, Parent will cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share
whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(A) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(f)) to the Paying Agent or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
letter of transmittal, and such letter of transmittal will be in customary
form) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in
Section 2.2(f)) or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may thereafter surrender such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent under cover of the letter of
transmittal, as agent for such holder. Upon delivery of a valid letter of
transmittal and the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(f)) or Book-Entry Shares on or
before the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Merger Sub will cause the
Paying Agent to pay the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in
exchange for the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, cash in an amount equal to
the



CLI-202375011v3 

Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares represented by such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in
Section 2.2(f)) or Book-Entry Shares. After the Effective Time, Certificates
(other than Shares held by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent and shares held in the treasury of the Company) or Book-
Entry Shares will represent solely the right to receive the aggregate Merger
Consideration relating to the Shares represented by such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(f)) or
Book-Entry Shares.

(ii) If payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of cancelled Shares is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name surrendered
Certificates are registered, it will be a condition to such payment that the
Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment will have
paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name
other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered or
will have established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax is
not applicable. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II will be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
theretofore represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to the
Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions, in each case with a record date (A) before the Effective Time
that may have been declared or made by the Company on such Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (B) before the Signing Date,
and in each case that remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be
closed and there will not be any further registration of transfers of any
shares of the Company's capital stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to any Shares,
except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates (other than Certificates representing
Shares held by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent and shares held in the treasury of the Company) or Book-Entry Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they will be cancelled and
exchanged for Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II. No interest
will accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon the surrender of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares or on any unpaid dividends relating to such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares that immediately before the Effective Time represented
the Shares.

(d) Promptly following the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any cash, including any interest received with respect to such cash, and
any Certificates or other documents, in its possession relating to the
Transactions, that had been made available to the Paying Agent and that have
not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or
previously delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and thereafter such holders
will be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject



CLI-202375011v3 

to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) only as general creditors of
the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, without any
interest on such Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent will be liable to any
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered
to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any
holder of Shares, and from amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.3, such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under any Tax Law with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such
withheld or deducted amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or other securities
in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

(f) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, the posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or,
at the election of Parent or the Paying Agent, a bond in such customary amount
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to
the number of Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate.

(g) The Paying Agent will invest all cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, except that any investment of such cash will be limited to
direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed
as to principal and interest by, the United States of America in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, and, in any such case, no
such instrument will have a maturity exceeding three months, and that no such
investment or loss thereon will affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments will be paid to the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to Section 2.2(d). To the extent that there are losses
with respect to such investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other
reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger
Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent will promptly replace or restore
the portion of the Payment Fund lost through investments or other events so as
to ensure that the Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level
sufficient to make such payments.

Section 2.3 Treatment of Company Stock Awards.





CLI-202375011v3 

(a) Each option to purchase Company Common Shares granted under any Company
Stock Plan ("Option") that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective
Time (whether vested or unvested) will, as of the Effective Time, become fully
vested and be cancelled, extinguished and converted into the right of the
holder to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(i) the total number of Company Common Shares issuable upon exercise of such
Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of such Option (the "Option Cash Payment") and as of
the Effective Time each holder of an Option will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment; provided
that, if the exercise price of any such Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such Option will be cancelled without any payment being
made in respect thereof. The Option Cash Payment will be paid in cash promptly
(and no later than ten Business Days) following the Effective Time.

(b) Each share of restricted stock granted under any Company Stock Plan that
remains subject to performance-based vesting criteria ("Performance Restricted
Share") that is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will, as of
immediately before the Effective Time, become vested to the extent provided in
this Section 2.3(b). To the extent the performance period relating to any such
Performance Restricted Share has not expired as of the Effective Time, the
Performance Restricted Share shall vest in that number of Company Common
Shares determined as if the applicable performance-based vesting criteria had
been achieved at the maximum level. To the extent the performance period
relating to any such Performance Restricted Share has expired as of the
Effective Time, the Performance Restricted Share shall vest in that number of
Company Common Shares determined at the end of the performance period based on
actual performance through the end of the performance period. Each such
Performance Restricted Share that vests pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) will,
as of immediately before the Effective Time no longer be subject to
restrictions (including any holding period restrictions) and will be treated
as an outstanding Share described in Section 2.1(a) of this Agreement. In
addition, as of the Effective Time, any holder of a Performance Restricted
Share will be entitled to receive any accrued but unpaid dividends previously
declared by the Company and any interest earned thereon as of the Effective
Time with respect to such Performance Restricted Share. Such dividends and
interest will be paid in cash to such holder of the Performance Restricted
Share promptly (and no later than ten Business Days) following the Effective
Time.

(c) Each share of restricted stock granted under any Company Stock Plan or
granted as dividends, other than any Performance Restricted Share ("Restricted
Share"), that is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will, as of
immediately before the Effective Time, become fully vested and no longer
subject to restrictions (including any holding period restrictions), and will
be treated as an outstanding share described in Section 2.1(a) of this
Agreement.

(d) All equity-based awards (for the avoidance of doubt, not including any
awards subject to the treatment specified in Section 2.3(a), 2.3(b) or 2.3(c))
deferred under any Company Plan that provides for the deferral of compensation
and all accounts that represent amounts notionally invested in Company Common
Shares under the Company's Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan
(collectively, "Deferred



CLI-202375011v3 

Compensation Plans" and such deferred equity-based awards and notionally
invested amounts, "Deferred Share Units"), will, as of immediately before the
Effective Time, become vested and no longer subject to restrictions (including
any holding period restrictions) to the same extent such award would have
vested under Section 2.3(a), 2.3(b) or 2.3(c), as applicable, had the award
not been deferred. All Deferred Share Units will, at the Effective Time, be
adjusted and converted into a right of the holder to have allocated to the
holder's account under any such Deferred Compensation Plan an amount
denominated in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Common
Shares deemed invested under or otherwise referenced by such account
immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration,
reduced, to the extent applicable, but not below zero, by the exercise price
applicable to such award(s), and will cease to represent a right to receive a
number of Company Common Shares or cash equal to or based on the value of a
number of Company Common Shares. The Deferred Compensation Plans will
otherwise be administered in accordance with their terms, subject to Section
6.9.

(e) Before the Effective Time, the Company will take all such lawful actions
as may be necessary (which include satisfying the requirements of Rule
16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act), without incurring any liability
in connection therewith, to provide for and give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.3, subject in all cases to the requirements of
applicable Law, including Section 409A of the Code, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 2.3, the Company shall in no event
take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in a violation of
or a penalty under the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

Section 2.4 Dissenters' Rights.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
Shares held by a holder who has demanded and perfected his, her or its demand
for appraisal of his, her or its Shares in accordance with the OGCL (including
OGCL section 1701.85) and as of the Effective Time has neither effectively
withdrawn nor lost his, her or its right to such appraisal ("Dissenting
Shares") will not be converted into or represent a right to receive cash
pursuant to Section 2.1(a), but the holder of the Dissenting Shares will be
entitled to only such rights as are granted to holders of Dissenting Shares by
the OGCL.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(a), if any holder of Shares
who demands appraisal of his, her or its Shares under the OGCL effectively
withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his, her or its
right to appraisal, then as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such
event, whichever later occurs, such holder's Shares will automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a), without interest thereon, upon
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing such Shares
pursuant to Section 2.2.

(c) The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal or payment of the fair value of any Shares, withdrawals of such



CLI-202375011v3 

demands and any other pertinent instruments served pursuant to the OGCL and
received by the Company. The Company will not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal and will not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, settle or offer to settle any such demands.

Section 2.5 Adjustments. If at any time during the period between the Signing
Date and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital
stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
shares of capital stock, of the Company will occur as a result of any merger,
business combination, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, the Merger Consideration will be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change, except that nothing in
this Section 2.5 will be construed to permit the Company to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

amendment, acceleration, creation or other occurrence that would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

and the consummation of the Transactions by the Company do not and will not
require any consent, approval, order, authorization or permit of, action by,

As of its respective date or, if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment, each Company SEC Document, including any financial statements,
schedules or exhibits included or incorporated by reference therein at the
time they were filed (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as
of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date
hereof), (i) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated in such Company SEC Document or
necessary in order to make the statements in such Company SEC Document, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii)
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC under the Exchange Act and the Securities
Act, as the case may be. None of the Company's Subsidiaries is, or at any time

the applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect to such requirements, (iii) has been

CLI-202375011v3 

consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods referred to in
the Company Financial Statements.

(b) Neither the Company nor any of the Company's Subsidiaries is a party to,
or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance
sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to
any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured-finance, special-purpose or limited-purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand or any "off-balance-sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S‑K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose
or effect of such arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Company's Financial Statements or other Company SEC
Documents.

(c) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has
made all certifications required by Rules 13a‑14 and 15d‑14 under the Exchange
Act and sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, "SOX") with respect to the
Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications
were true and accurate in all material respects on the date such
certifications were made. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" will have the meanings given to
such terms in SOX. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
outstanding (nor has arranged or modified since the enactment of SOX) any
"extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX) to directors
or executive officers (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company is otherwise in compliance
with all applicable provisions of SOX and the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules of the NYSE and/or NASDAQ, as applicable, except for any non-
compliance that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(d) The Company has established and maintains a system of "internal control
over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) that is designed to provide reasonable assurance (i) regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that receipts
and expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and the Company Board, and (iii)
regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' assets that could have a
material effect on the Company's financial statements. The Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of such internal control over
financial reporting prior to the Signing Date, to the Company's auditors and
the audit committee of the Company Board and on Section 3.5(d) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably



CLI-202375011v3 

likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting. For purposes of this
Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall
have the meaning assigned to them in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
Auditing Standard 2, as in effect on the Signing Date.

(e) The Company's "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

Section 3.6 Absence of Certain Changes. (a) Since January 1, 2014 through the
Signing Date, except as otherwise required or contemplated by the negotiation,
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice in all material respects and
(b) since January 1, 2014, there has not been any Material Adverse Effect or
any condition, fact, circumstance, event, change, effect or occurrence
(including the incurrence of any liabilities of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise) that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.7 No Undisclosed Material Liabilities. There are no liabilities or
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether accrued,
absolute, determined or contingent that would be required to be reflected or
reserved against on a consolidated statement of financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP or
disclosed in the notes thereto, except for liabilities or obligations (i)
disclosed and provided for in the balance sheet dated as of December 31, 2014
included in the Company Financial Statements (or in the notes thereto) filed
and publicly available before the Signing Date, (ii) incurred in connection
with the Transactions or this Agreement, or (iii) incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2013.

Section 3.8 Compliance with Laws and Orders. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is and, since January 1, 2013, has been in compliance with all
applicable Laws and Orders, except for failures to comply or violations that
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2013, no Governmental Entity has
issued any notice or notification stating that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is not in compliance with any Law, except where such non-
compliance would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries hold
all governmental licenses, clearances, authorizations, permits, consents and
approvals



CLI-202375011v3 

necessary for the operation of the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole ("Company Permits"), except where such failure
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any Company Permits
is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
threatened, except for any such suspension or cancellation which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is and, since January
1, 2013, has been in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, except
for failures to comply that would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. This Section 3.8
does not relate to environmental matters (which is the subject of Section
3.15).

the Special Meeting (such proxy statement, as amended or supplemented from
time to time, the "Proxy Statement") will not, at the date it is first mailed
to the Company's shareholders or at the time of the Special Meeting or at the
time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain (by incorporation or

management or directors, on the other hand, as of the Signing Date that relate

make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

Sub under this Agreement, including paying the aggregate Merger Consideration
at Closing, any required refinancings or repayments of the Revolving Credit
Facility, the Term Loan Facility and the Existing Notes and paying all related

(b) As of the Signing Date, Parent and Merger Sub have received (i) an
executed equity commitment letter dated as of the Signing Date ("Equity
Commitment Letter") from the Guarantors to provide equity financing in an
aggregate amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth therein ("Equity Financing"), which Equity
Commitment Letter provides that the Company is a third-party beneficiary
thereto, and (ii) an executed debt commitment letter and executed fee letter
associated therewith, each dated as of the Signing Date (such commitment
letter, and all attached exhibits, schedules, annexes that are delivered on
the Signing Date and amendments thereto permitted by the term hereof and any
fee letter delivered on the Signing Date (which may be redacted as described
below), collectively, "Debt Commitment Letter" and, together with the Equity
Commitment Letter, "Commitment Letters") from RBC Capital Markets, LLC and TD
Securities (USA) LLC ("Financing Sources"), pursuant to which the Financing
Sources have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter, to provide to Parent the amount of financing set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter ("Debt Financing" and, together with the Equity
Financing, "Financing"), for the Financing Purposes (as defined below). A true
and complete copy of each fully executed Commitment Letter as in effect on the
Signing Date has been provided to the Company. A true and complete copy of
each fee letter and engagement letter related to the Debt Commitment Letter as
in effect on the Signing Date has been provided to the Company, except that
the numerical fees and other commercially sensitive numerical information
therein (including provisions in such fee letter related solely to fees, "flex
terms" and economic terms) may have been redacted; provided, however, that no
redacted term provides that the aggregate amount of the Financing set forth in
the unredacted portion of the Debt Commitment Letter could be reduced or adds
any conditions, contingencies or affects the availability of all or any
portion of the Debt Financing (other than any fees, expenses, original issue
discount and similar premiums and charges). Parent and Merger Sub have fully
paid (or caused to be paid) all commitment and other fees, if any, required by
such Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the Signing Date. As of the
Signing Date, each Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Parent, Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other party
thereto, subject to the General Enforceability Exceptions, and in full force
and effect, has not been and not contemplated to be (other than as permitted
hereunder), amended, modified, withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any
respect, and no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of
time or both) would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach thereunder
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub. Except for the fee letter referred to in
the Debt Commitment Letter (a copy of which has been provided to the Company
in accordance with the foregoing, which may be redacted as permitted herein),
as of the Signing Date, there are no side letters or other Contracts,
arrangements or understandings related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the

Sources. As of the Signing Date, there are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies (x) related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing
or any provisions that could reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing set
forth in any Commitment Letter or the aggregate proceeds contemplated by any
Commitment Letter or (y) that could otherwise adversely affect the
conditionality, enforceability or availability of the Debt Commitment Letter
with respect to all or any portion of the Debt Financing, in each case, other
than as expressly set forth in the applicable Commitment Letter. As of the
Signing Date, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that
the Financing will not be available to Parent on the date on which the Closing
should occur pursuant to Section 1.2, provided that Parent and Merger Sub are
not making any representation or warranty regarding the effect of any
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties in Article III or compliance
by the Company and their respective Affiliates with their respective
obligations hereunder.

(c) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Guarantors have
delivered to the Company the duly executed Guaranty. The Guaranty is in full
force and effect, has not been amended or modified, and is a legal, valid,
binding and enforceable obligation of the Guarantors. As of the Signing Date,
no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantors under the Guaranty.

Section 4.7 No Prior Activities. Merger Sub has been formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the Transaction and the Financing and before the
Effective Time will have engaged in no other business activities and will have
incurred no liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated in this
Agreement. As of the Signing Date, the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub
consists of 100 shares of common stock, no par value per share, all of which
are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Merger Sub is, and immediately before the Effective Time will be,
owned by Parent. At the Closing, the Guarantors will directly or indirectly
beneficially own all of the outstanding equity securities of Parent.

Section 4.8 Litigation. As of the Signing Date, there are no Actions pending
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub that
would prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions or the
Financing. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is a party or subject to or in
default under any Order that would prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions or the Financing.

Section 4.9 No Vote of Parent Shareholders. Except for the adoption of the
Agreement by Parent as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, no vote of the
shareholders of Parent or the holders of any other securities of Parent
(equity or otherwise), is required by any applicable Law, the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent (or similar organizational documents) or the
applicable rules of any exchange



CLI-202375011v3 

on which securities of Parent are traded, in order for Parent to consummate
the Transactions and the Financing.

Section 4.10 Brokers and Finders. No agent, broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is or will be entitled to any broker\'s or
finder\'s fee or any other commission or similar fee or payment based upon
arrangements made by and on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries could have liability prior to Closing.

Section 4.11 Solvency. Assuming that (a) the conditions to the obligation of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger have been satisfied or waived,
(b) any written estimates, projections or forecasts prepared by the Company or
its Representatives and made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their
Representatives have been prepared in good faith based upon reasonable
assumptions, and (c) the most recent Company Financial Statements fairly
present the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the end of the periods covered thereby and the consolidated
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods
covered thereby, then immediately following the Effective Time and after
giving effect to all of the Transactions and the Financing, the payment of the
aggregate consideration to which the shareholders of the Company are entitled
under Article II, funding of any obligations of the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries that become due or payable by the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries in connection with, or as a result of, the Merger, any
required refinancings or repayments of existing Indebtedness of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and payment of all related fees and expenses, each of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not (i) be insolvent
(either because its financial condition is such that the sum of its debts,
including contingent and other liabilities, is greater than the fair market
value of its assets or because the fair saleable value of its assets is less
than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature), (ii) have
unreasonably small capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is
engaged or proposed to be engaged, or (iii) have incurred debts, or be
expected to incur debts, including contingent and other liabilities, beyond
its ability to pay them as they become due.

Section 4.12 Disclaimer of Warranties. Except for the representations and
warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in this Article IV, none of Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Person makes any representations or warranties on
behalf of Parent and Merger Sub. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that
neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any other Person has made any
express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of the Company or any
of its Affiliates as to the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding the Company provided to Parent and Merger Sub, except as expressly
set forth in Article III. In connection with any investigation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger Sub have
received or may receive from the Company, its Affiliates or other Persons on
behalf of the Company certain projections, forward-looking statements and
other forecasts and certain business plan information in written or verbal
communications.



CLI-202375011v3 

Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans,
that Parent and Merger Sub are familiar with such uncertainties, that Parent
and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation
of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and
that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company or any other
Person with respect thereto. Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge
that neither the Company nor any other Person on behalf of the Company makes
any representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts or plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans).

respective officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents, financial

confidential information provided



CLI-202375011v3 

by or on behalf of the Company or its Affiliates in connection with any such
discussions or negotiations be returned or destroyed. The Company and its
Subsidiaries will not, and will direct each of their respective
Representatives not to (A) directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or
knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public
information) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company
Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any non-public
information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating, a Company Takeover Proposal, or (C) enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
investment agreement or other agreement of any kind with respect to a Company
Takeover Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(a) or
any other provisions of this Agreement, if prior to receipt of Shareholder
Approval the Company or any of its Representatives receives a written Company
Takeover Proposal from any Person or group of Persons, which Company Takeover
Proposal did not result from any breach of this Section 5.2, (i) the Company
and its Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons to clarify
the terms and conditions thereof and (ii) if the Company Board or any duly
constituted and authorized committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and legal counsel, that such Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may, upon
notice to Parent and after such Person enters into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, (A) furnish information (including non-public
information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or
group of Persons who has made such Company Takeover Proposal, except that the
Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide to Parent any
written information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided to any Person given such access which was not previously provided to
Parent or its Representatives and (B) engage in or otherwise participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such
Company Takeover Proposal.

(c) The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed of any material
developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any written Company
Takeover Proposal on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours). The
Company agrees that the Company and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any
confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the Signing Date that
prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance
with this Section 5.2.

the Company Board will not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or
publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (C) take any formal action or
make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer
or exchange



CLI-202375011v3 

offer other than a recommendation against such offer or a customary "stop,
look and listen" communication (it being understood that the Company Board may
refrain from taking a position with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal
until the close of business as of the tenth Business Day after the
commencement of a tender offer in connection with such Company Takeover
Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without such action
being considered such an adverse modification), or (D) adopt, approve,
recommend or publicly propose to approve or recommend to shareholders of the
Company a Company Takeover Proposal, (each, a "Company Adverse Recommendation
Change"), (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
merger agreement or any other agreement with respect to any Company Takeover
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), or take any
action that is intended to, or taken for the purpose of, impeding or
materially interfering with the Merger or any of the other Transactions
hereunder (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement"), or (iii) take any action
pursuant to Section 8.1(c). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, before the time the Shareholder Approval is obtained, the
Company Board may, in response to a Company Takeover Proposal, make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement or
take any action pursuant to Section 8.1(c) if the Company Board or any duly
constituted and authorized committee thereof has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and legal counsel, that (x) the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and (y) such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes
a Company Superior Proposal, except that (1) the Company has given Parent at
least four calendar days' prior written notice of its intention to take such
action, (2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose in writing an offer
binding on Parent to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that
it would cause such Company Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Company Superior Proposal, (3) following the end of such notice period, the
Company Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof will
have considered in good faith such binding offer and will have determined that
the Company Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior
Proposal if the revisions proposed in such binding offer were to be given
effect, and (4) in the event of any material change to the material terms of
such Company Superior Proposal, the Company will, in each case, have delivered
to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (1)
above and the notice period will have recommenced, except that the notice
period will be at least two Business Days (rather than the four calendar days
otherwise contemplated by clause (1) above).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, before the
time the Shareholder Approval is obtained, in the event a material development
or material change in circumstances (other than a Company Takeover Proposal)
occurs or arises after the Signing Date that was not known and not reasonably
foreseeable by the Company Board as of the Signing Date, the Company Board may
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change,
qualify, withhold, withdraw



CLI-202375011v3 

or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation ("Change
of Recommendation") if the Company Board or any duly constituted and
authorized committee thereof has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, except that such action will not be in response to a Company
Takeover Proposal, any change in board membership, or a Company Superior
Proposal (which is governed by Section 5.2(d)) and before taking such action,
(i) the Company Board has given Parent at least four calendar days' prior
written notice of its intention to take such action and a description of the
reasons for the Change of Recommendation, (ii) the Company has negotiated, and
has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during
such notice period after giving any such notice, to the extent Parent wishes
to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose in writing an offer binding on
Parent to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement in such a manner
that would obviate the need for making such Change of Recommendation, and
(iii) at the end of such notice period, the Company Board or any duly
constituted and authorized committee thereof will have considered in good
faith such binding offer, and will have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and legal counsel, that failure to
effect a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company
Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or in Section 6.6 will prohibit the
Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure to the Company's shareholders
if, in the Company Board's determination in good faith after consultation with
legal counsel, the failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable Law.

consideration, make any accommodation commitment or incur any liability or
obligation to such Person in connection with such consent to the extent such
cost or liability is not reimbursed by Parent or Merger Sub and (2) the
receipt of such consent shall not be a condition to the Closing).
Additionally, each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable best
efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to the Merger and shall not take

materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any consent,
authorization, Order or approval of, or exemption by, any Governmental Entity
necessary to be obtained before Closing.

(b) Before the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other
parties to this Agreement with respect to, provide any necessary information

CLI-202375011v3 

Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. Each party to
this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this Agreement of

as applicable, to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, except that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available under this Agreement to the party
receiving such notice.

Section 6.5 Access; Confidentiality. Subject to applicable Law relating to the
sharing of information, the Company agrees to provide Parent and its
Representatives, from time to time before the earlier of the Effective Time or

the purpose of obtaining surveys and to conduct Phase I environmental site
assessments, but no access to conduct Phase II or other environmental or
intrusive sampling shall be granted without the Company's prior written
consent, which shall be granted in the Company's sole discretion), books,
Contracts, personnel and records and (b) such other information as Parent
shall reasonably request with respect to the Company and its business,
financial condition and operations, except that nothing in this Agreement
shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (x) provide such
access at times or in a manner that the Company's Representatives reasonably
believe is likely to materially disrupt the ordinary-course operations of the
businesses of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (y) disclose any information
to Parent or its Representatives that (i) would cause a violation of any
contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (ii)
would result in a loss of attorney-client privilege with respect to material
information to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent shall and shall
cause Parent's Affiliates and Representatives to keep confidential any non-
public information received from the Company, its Affiliates or its
Representatives, directly or indirectly, pursuant to this Section 6.5 in
accordance with Section 2 of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.6 Publicity. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be
a Company press release and thereafter none of the Company, Parent nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other



CLI-202375011v3 

announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without the
prior consultation of the other party and giving the other party the
opportunity to review and comment on such press release or other announcement,
except as required by applicable Law, by any listing agreement with or rules
of any applicable national securities exchange, trading market or listing
authority or as may be requested by a Governmental Entity. The Company shall
consult with Parent and Merger Sub prior to issuing any press release or other
public announcement that would be required to be filed pursuant to Section 14
of the Exchange Act.

Section 6.7 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in
connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on
or arising out of, in whole or in part, (i) the fact that an Indemnified Party
was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) acts or omissions by such Indemnified Party in the
Indemnified Party's capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or taken at the request of the Company
or a Subsidiary of the Company (including in connection with serving at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee,
agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person), in each case under (i) or
(ii), at, or at any time before, the Effective Time (including any Action
relating in whole or in part to the Merger or the enforcement of this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified
Party), to the fullest extent permitted or required by applicable Law.

(b) Parent guarantees, and the Surviving Corporation shall assume, all
obligations of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in respect of rights of
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions
occurring at or before the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed before,
at or after the Effective Time, existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties
as provided in the respective constituent documents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or in any written Contract described on the Company
Disclosure Letter or filed as an exhibit to any document filed with the SEC
(including forms of agreement filed with the SEC) or available under
applicable Law, except that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue
until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time until six
years from the Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law,
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable
to the Indemnified Parties with respect to limitation of liabilities of
directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the
Signing Date in the



CLI-202375011v3 

Company's constituent documents or available under applicable Law, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties.
In addition, from the Effective Time until six years from the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance any
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnified
Party under this Section 6.7 (including in connection with enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations referred to in this Section 6.7) as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided that the
individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is determined that such person is not entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to this Section 6.7(b).

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries, or provide substitute policies or purchase
or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, extended reporting period
otherwise known as a "tail policy" with reputable insurers, in each case of at
least the same coverage and scope, and in amounts, and containing terms and
conditions, that are no less favorable to such individuals than such policy in
effect on the Signing Date, with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time covering without limitation the Transactions; provided,
however¸ that in satisfying its obligations under this Section 6.7(c), Parent
shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the amount
per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the Signing
Date (the "Current Premium") and if such premiums for such insurance would at
any time exceed 250% of the Current Premium, then Parent shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance that, in Parent's good faith judgment,
provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 250% of
the Current Premium. The Company may before the Effective Time purchase a six-
year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions providing at least
substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters existing or occurring before the Effective Time,
covering without limitation the Transactions; provided, however, that the
amount paid for such prepaid policies does not exceed 250% of the Current
Premium. If such prepaid "tail policy" has been obtained by the Company, it
shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to
this Section 6.7(c) and the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect,
for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, and his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under the
Company's constituent documents, by Contract or otherwise. The obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.7 may not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely



CLI-202375011v3 

affect the rights of any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.7 applies
unless (i) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or
(ii) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this Section 6.7 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of
this Section 6.7).

(e) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

Section 6.8 Merger Sub Compliance. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply
with all of its obligations under or related to this Agreement.

Section 6.9 Employee Matters.

(a) From the Effective Time until the twelve-month anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries whose terms and conditions of
employment were not, and do not become, subject to a collective bargaining
agreement who is employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
immediately before the Effective Time ("Company Non-Union Employees"), for so
long as such person is an employee of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Subsidiaries, (i) base salary or wage rates that, on an individual-
by-individual basis, are no less favorable than those provided to such Company
Non-Union Employee immediately before the Effective Time, (ii) total target
incentive compensation opportunities at least as favorable as the total target
incentive compensation opportunities available to such Company Non-Union
Employees immediately before the Effective Time, and (iii) employee benefits
(including, as applicable, severance benefits) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided as of the Signing Date by the
Company and its Subsidiaries as applicable, provided to each such Company Non-
Union Employee immediately before the Effective Time. Nothing herein shall
restrict the right of the Company or Parent or any Subsidiary of Company or
Parent to terminate the employment of any employee; provided, that any such
termination is effected in accordance with applicable Law. Nothing herein
shall restrict the right of the Company or Parent or any Subsidiary of the
Company or Parent to terminate any Company Plan or other employee benefit
plan; provided, that any such termination is effected in accordance with
applicable Law and the terms of such Company Plan.

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and benefit accrual
(other than for purposes of benefit accruals under any pension plan sponsored
by Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries))
under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing
benefits to any Company Non-Union Employees after the Effective Time ("New
Plans"), each Company Non-Union Employee shall be credited with his or her
years of service with the



CLI-202375011v3 

Company and its Subsidiaries or predecessors before the Effective Time, to the
same extent as such Company Non-Union Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar employee benefit
plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Non-Union
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately before the
Effective Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Non-Union
Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans for which such Company Non-Union Employee
becomes eligible to participate, to the extent such Company Non-Union Employee
had coverage under a comparable Company Plan immediately before the
consummation of the Transactions (such plans, collectively, "Old Plans") and
(ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing welfare benefits to any Company
Non-Union Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not
have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries
in which such employee participated immediately before the Effective Time, and
Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan
(subject to the receipt by Parent or the applicable vendors of any information
which is reasonably necessary regarding such covered expenses previously
paid).

(c) Parent and the Company, as applicable, will cause all bonus amounts under
annual cash bonus, annual equity bonus, sales and other cash incentive plans
of the Company and its Subsidiaries ("Bonus Amounts") with respect to the
fiscal year in which the Closing occurs to be calculated and paid in the
ordinary course of business to the eligible employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, except that such Bonus Amounts under the Single-Year Cash
Incentive Plan and the Single-Year Equity Incentive Plan, will be (i) deemed
to be earned at the target level of performance and (ii) paid in cash as soon
as practicable, but not later than the second regularly scheduled payroll date
occurring on or following the Closing Date, except that if the timing of such
payment of the Bonus Amounts under the Single-Year Equity Incentive Plan as
described in this Agreement would cause any additional Taxes to be payable
pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, the payment will instead be made at the
time specified in under the applicable plan document.

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a "change of control" (or
equivalent phrase) within the meaning of the Company Plans shall occur at or
before the Effective Time, as applicable, for purposes of all Company Plans in
which the term is relevant.



CLI-202375011v3 

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.9 shall (i) be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any benefit plan or (ii) prohibit Parent or any of its
Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, from amending or terminating
any employee benefit plan. The provisions of this Section 6.9 are solely for
the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this
Section 6.9, express or implied, shall confer upon any employee, or legal
representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any
right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this
Agreement.

Section 6.10 Parent Approval. Immediately following the execution of this
Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance with DGCL section
228(a) and in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, a written
consent adopting the plan of merger contained in this Agreement.

Section 6.11 Financing. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, as promptly as possible, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing Date,
including maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and using
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as possible, (a) satisfy, or cause to
be satisfied, on a timely basis, or obtain a waiver of, all conditions
precedent in the Debt Commitment Letter that are to be satisfied by Parent and
Merger Sub, (b) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to
the Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter or on such other terms that would not reduce the amount of proceeds of
the Debt Financing below the amount necessary (together with the proceeds from
the Equity Financing and other funds available to the Parent and Merger Sub),
for Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and would not reasonably be expected to delay or impair the Closing or make
funding materially less likely to occur on or before the Closing and (c)
consummate the Financing at the Closing. Parent and Merger Sub shall give the
Company reasonably prompt written notice (i) of any breach or default (or any
event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to result in breach or default) by Parent, Merger
Sub, or to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any party to any Commitment
Letter or other Debt Document, (ii) if and when Parent or Merger Sub becomes
aware that any portion of the Financing contemplated by any Commitment Letter
may not be available for the Financing Purposes, (iii) of the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication from any party to the Commitment
Letter with respect to any actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter or other Debt Document, (iv)
if for any reason Parent or any of its Affiliates believes in good faith that
there is a reasonable possibility that it shall not be able to obtain any
portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner and from the sources
contemplated by any Commitment Letter (including any related flex terms) or
the definitive agreements with respect thereto (such definitive agreements
related to the Debt Financing, collectively, with the Debt Commitment



CLI-202375011v3 

Letter, "Debt Documents") and such portion is reasonably required to fund the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (v) of any expiration or
termination of any Commitment Letter or other Debt Document. Parent and Merger
Sub will (1) comply in all material respects with the Equity Commitment Letter
and each of the Debt Documents and (2) enforce in all material respects its
rights under the Equity Commitment Letter and, in the event of a breach or
other failure to fund the Debt Financing required to consummate the
Transactions on the Closing Date by the Financing Sources, each of the Debt
Documents. Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the Company's prior
written consent, permit or consent to (x) any amendment, supplement or
modification to be made to the Equity Commitment Letter or (y) any amendment,
supplement or modification to be made to the Debt Commitment Letter if such
amendment, supplement or modification would (A) materially impair, delay or
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(B) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (unless (a) such
reduction is matched with an equal increase of the Equity Financing under the
Equity Commitment Letter or (b) after giving effect to such reduction, the
representation and warranty in Section 4.6 shall be true and correct as though
such representation and warranty was being made as of the date of such
reduction and after giving effect thereto), (C) impose new or additional
conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Debt Financing (unless such new or additional conditions or
expanded, amended or modified conditions could not be reasonably expected to
(1) delay or prevent the Closing Date, (2) make the timely funding of the Debt
Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing
less likely to occur or (3) adversely affect the ability of Purchaser to
enforce its rights against other parties with respect to the Debt Financing)
or (D) otherwise reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, the "Restricted Commitment Letter Amendments");
provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser may amend, supplement,
modify or waive any terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and/or the Debt
Financing Documents with respect thereto without the consent of the Company or
Sellers in order to (1) correct typographical errors, (2) add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities (by assignment
or otherwise) as expressly contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter on the
date hereof or (3) reallocate commitments or assign or reassign titles or
roles to, or between or among, any entities party thereto. For purposes of
this Agreement, references to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such
document(s) as permitted or required by this Section 6.11 to be amended,
modified or waived, in each case from and after such amendment, modification
or waiver.

In the event of any Financing Failure Event, each of Parent and Merger Sub
shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain, or cause to be
obtained, alternative financing, including from alternative sources, in an
amount sufficient to replace any unavailable portion of the Financing
("Alternative Financing") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence
of such Financing Failure Event, on terms that are not materially less
favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter (including any "flex" provisions applicable



CLI-202375011v3 

thereto) and the provisions of this Section 6.11, Section 9.6, Section 9.8(b)
and Section 9.11 shall be applicable to the Alternative Financing, and, for
the purposes of this Section 6.11, Section 6.12, Section 9.6, Section 9.8(b),
and Section 9.11, all references to the Financing shall be deemed to include
such Alternative Financing, all references to Debt Documents shall include the
applicable documents for the Alternative Financing and all references to the
Financing Sources shall include the Persons providing or arranging the
Alternative Financing. In the event that each of Parent and Merger Sub has
obtained substitute financing (including by way of debt incurred under any
federal agency multifamily loan programs), the proceeds of which are received
on the Closing Date and which amount substitutes an equivalent portion of the
Debt Financing, for the purposes of Section 4.6 and Section 6.12, all
references to the Financing shall be deemed to include such substitute
financing.

Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of
the Financing, or any Alternative Financing, is not a condition to Closing and
reaffirms its obligation to consummate the Transactions irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Financing or any Alternative

take actions reasonably requested by Parent that are reasonably necessary to
consummate a Debt Prepayment (including, to the extent available, the deposit
of cash or cash equivalents to such Person designated by the Parent, in an
amount sufficient to prepay the Existing Notes pursuant to the Notes Purchase
Agreements), pursuant to the applicable pricing provisions in the Notes
Purchase Agreements, provided that in each case, Parent and Merger Sub shall,
and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective representatives to, provide cooperation reasonably requested by the
Company in connection with the Debt Prepayment.

event shall the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers, directors or other representatives, have any obligation to
authorize, adopt or execute any amendments or other agreement that would

promptly pay for, any Existing Notes that have been validly tendered pursuant
to and in accordance with the Debt Offers and not properly withdrawn using
funds provided by Parent.

(e) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with any Debt Offers and Debt Prepayments, including the Offer

Offer Documents and Prepayment Notices. The Company shall, to the extent
requested, keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the status, results and
timing of the Debt Offers and Debt Prepayments. The Offer Documents (including
all amendments or supplements



CLI-202375011v3 

thereto) and all mailings to the holders of the Existing Notes in connection
with any Debt Offers and Debt Prepayment shall be subject to the prior review
of, and comment by, the Company and its legal counsel, and shall be reasonably
acceptable to them. If, at any time prior to the completion of the Debt
Offers, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, discovers any information that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so
that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, such party that discovers such
information shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly notify the other
party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Parent
describing such information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to the holders of the Existing Notes.

shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, comply with the requirements of
Rule 14e‑1 under the Exchange Act and any other Law to the extent applicable
in connection with the Debt Offers and such compliance will not be deemed a
breach hereof.

(f) In connection with any Debt Offer and any Debt Prepayment, Parent may
select one or more dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and other
agents, in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to
provide assistance in connection therewith and the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into customary agreements with such parties
so selected; provided that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless, or pay the fees or
reimburse the costs and expenses of, any such party, which indemnification,
fee and reimbursement obligations shall be borne by Parent pursuant to
separate agreements with such parties to which neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be a party or have any obligations under. Parent shall
reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all of their reasonable costs
and expenses incurred in connection with any Debt Offers or any Debt
Prepayment promptly following the incurrence thereof, including the
reasonable, documented and invoiced fees and expenses of their counsel. Parent
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and
each of their respective Affiliates from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties (excluding, to the extent previously reimbursed, the costs and
expenses referred to in the immediately preceding sentence) suffered or
incurred by any such Person, or to which any such Person may become subject,
that arise out of, or is in any way in connection with, the Debt Offers,
Change or Control Offer, and Debt Prepayment, or any actions taken or not
taken by the Company, or taken at the request of Parent, pursuant to this
Section 6.17 or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case other than
arising from any information provided in writing specifically for use by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and to the extent any of the
foregoing arises from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct
of, or breach of this Agreement by, the Company or any of its subsidiaries or



CLI-202375011v3 

their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, accountants,
agents or representatives.

reimbursement obligations of Section 6.12, this Section 8.2, Article IX and
Article X hereof and the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement will
survive such termination, except that no party hereto or the Guarantors will
be relieved or released from liability for damages arising out of, any (i)
knowing material breach of any of its representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement or (ii) deliberate material breach of any of its covenants
contained in this Agreement. No party hereto claiming that such breach
occurred will have any duty or otherwise be obligated to mitigate any such
damages. For purposes of this Section 8.2(a), (A) a "knowing" breach of a
representation and warranty will be deemed to have occurred only if the
Company or Parent or Merger Sub had actual Knowledge of such breach as of the
Signing Date and (B) a "deliberate" breach of any covenant or agreement will
be deemed to have occurred only if the other party hereto took or failed to
take action with actual Knowledge that the action so taken or omitted to be
taken would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this
Agreement (it being understood that the failure of the Company or Parent to
consummate the Transactions when required under the terms of this Agreement
will constitute a deliberate material breach) and the aggrieved party hereto
will be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity,
including in the case of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub, liability to the
Company for damages, determined taking into account all relevant factors,
including the loss of the benefit of the Merger to the Company and the lost
shareholder premium. The individuals specified in the definition of
"Knowledge" (1)



CLI-202375011v3 

have read this Agreement, including the representations, warranties and
covenants contained in this Agreement, (2) have reviewed with counsel the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement, and (3)
for purposes of this Section 8.2(a), will be deemed to understand the meanings
of the representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to the provisions
of Section 8.1(d), (ii) by the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section
8.1(c) or (iii) by either the Company or by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(b)(iii) and (A) before such termination a Company
Takeover Proposal is received by the Company or becomes publicly known, and
(B) at any time on or before the 12-month anniversary of such termination, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into or consummates a transaction
with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or any Company Takeover
Proposals are consummated (except that solely for purposes of this Section
8.2(b)(iii)(B), the term "Company Takeover Proposal" will have the meaning set
forth in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal except that all
references to 20% will be deemed references to 50%) the Company will pay
Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer (to an account designated by
Parent) in immediately available funds (x) in the case of clause (i) of this
Section 8.2(b), within two Business Days after such termination, (y) in the
case of clause (ii) of this Section 8.2(b), before or concurrently with, and
as a condition to, such termination, and (z) in the case of clause (iii) of
this Section 8.2(b), upon the earlier of entering into such definitive
agreement with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by a Company Takeover Proposal. If this Agreement is
terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii), then the
Company shall promptly (but in no event more than two Business Days following
such termination) reimburse Parent for transaction expenses in the amount of
$20,000,000 ("Expenses"), by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more
accounts designated by Parent; provided, that if the Company becomes obligated
to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to a termination under Section 8.1
(b)(iii), the Termination Fee shall be reduced to the extent of any Expenses
actually paid to Parent. "Termination Fee" means a cash amount equal to
$60,000,000. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
payment of the Termination Fee will constitute liquidated damages, and from
and after such termination as described in this Section 8.2(b), the Company
will have no further liability of any kind for any reason in connection with
this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other than as provided
under Section 8.2(a), this Section 8.2(b) and Section 8.2(c). Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, under no circumstances, (other
than as provided in Section 8.2(a)) will Parent be entitled to monetary
damages for any loss or other liability of any kind suffered as a result of
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or the failure of the Transactions to be consummated in excess of
the Termination Fee together with any amounts due pursuant to Section 8.2(c)
(it being understood that in the case of liability as provided in Section
8.2(a), any prior payment of the Termination Fee shall be taken into account
when determining any remedies). In no event will Parent be entitled to the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.



CLI-202375011v3 

(c) The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in
Section 8.2(b) are integral parts of the Transactions, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due
pursuant to Section 8.2(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or
Merger Sub commences a claim, action, suit or other proceeding that results in
a judgment against the Company, the Company will pay to Parent interest on
such amount from and including the date payment of such amount was due to but
excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in the Wall
Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus
1%, together with reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection
with such claim, suit, proceeding or other action.

and regulations of NYSE or NASDAQ requires the further approval of the
shareholders of the Company without such further approval. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties
hereto, provided that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, this Section 9.1, Section 9.6, Section 9.8(b), Section 9.11 and

CLI-202375011v3 

Section 9.7 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is held
by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be
invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity
declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, void or
unenforceable, the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible and the parties agree that the court making such determination will
have the power to reduce the scope, duration, area or applicability of the
term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any
invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that
is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

Section 9.8 Governing Law.

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action based upon, arising out
of, or related to this Agreement, the Transactions or the Financing, will be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Ohio
and the mandatory provisions of the DGCL, without giving effect to principles
or rules of conflict of Laws to the extent such principles or rules would
require or permit the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties (i) agrees that it will not bring, permit any of its Affiliates
to bring or support any Person in any action, suit or proceeding of any kind
or description, whether in law, equity, contract, tort or otherwise, involving
any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, any of the
Transactions or the Financing, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal
and New York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City
of New York, (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) involving any of the Financing Sources in
any way relating to the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance thereof or
the financings contemplated thereby, will be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal Laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to principles or rules or conflict of Laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of Laws of
another jurisdiction, and (iii) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation
(whether in law, equity, contract, tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letters or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby. The Financing
Sources Related Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Section
9.8(b).



CLI-202375011v3 

(c) Subject to Section 9.8(b), any action, suit or proceeding based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Transactions or the Financing
will be brought in the state and federal courts located in the Borough of
Manhattan within the City of New York (or the appellate courts thereof), and
each of the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each
such court in any such action, suit or proceeding, waives any objection it may
now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of
forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the action, suit or proceeding
will be heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the Transactions or the Financing in any other court. Nothing in this
Agreement contained will be deemed to affect the right of any party to serve
process in any manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings or
otherwise proceed against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in each
case, to enforce judgments obtained in any action, suit or proceeding brought
pursuant to this Section 9.8(c).

Section 9.9 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations in this Agreement
may be assigned or delegated (a) by Parent without the prior written consent
of the Company or (b) by the Company without the prior written consent of
Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing, Parent may assign
all of its rights to payment under this Agreement for collateral security
purposes to any lender providing financing to Parent pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter, but no such assignment will relieve Parent or Merger Sub of
any liability or obligation under this Agreement.



Section 9.10 Specific Performance; Limitation of Liability.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them in
this Agreement to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree
that (i) the parties will be entitled to an injunction, specific performance
or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of damages, before
the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement, (ii) the provisions set forth in Section 8.2 (A) are not intended
to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a
breach of this Agreement and (B) will not be construed to diminish or
otherwise impair in any respect any party's right to specific enforcement, and
(iii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Transactions such that without that right none of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement. Each party agrees that



CLI-202375011v3 

it will not oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or
that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that any party
entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this Section 9.10(a) will not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such injunction and any party against whom
such injunction is entered expressly waives any bond or security in connection
therewith.

(b) [Reserved].

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company may pursue both a grant of
specific performance to the extent permitted by this Section 9.10 and the
payment of damages as contemplated by Section 8.2(a), but shall not be
entitled or permitted to receive an award of damages if specific performance
is awarded and consummation of the Merger occurs and shall not be entitled or
permitted to receive an award of specific performance if damages are awarded.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall the parties be liable hereunder for any consequential, incidental,
indirect, exemplary, special or punitive damages (other than consequential
damages that were reasonably foreseeable at the Signing Date).

Section 9.11 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the Transactions may only be brought against, the entities that
are expressly named as parties hereto (and the Guarantors in accordance with
the Guaranty and the Equity Commitment Letter) and then only with respect to
the specific obligations set forth in this Agreement with respect to such
party or, with respect to the Guarantors, set forth in the Guaranty or the
Equity Commitment Letter, except that nothing in this Agreement will limit the
rights and remedies of the Company and its Affiliates under the
Confidentiality Agreement. Without limiting the Company's rights and remedies
under the Confidentiality Agreement, except for the Guarantors in accordance
with the Guaranty and the Equity Commitment Letter (and then only to the
extent of the specific obligations undertaken by the Guarantors set forth in
the Guaranty or the Equity Commitment Letter), (x) no past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, shareholder,
agent, attorney, advisor, representative or Affiliate of any named party to
this Agreement and (y) no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, shareholder, agent, attorney, advisor,
representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing, and (z) no other
Financing Sources Related Party will have any liability (whether in contract,
tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any
one or more of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement (whether
for indemnification or otherwise) or for any claim based on, arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the Transactions. In no event shall the Company
or any of its Affiliates, and the Company agrees not to and to cause its



CLI-202375011v3 

Affiliates not to, seek to enforce this Agreement or the Debt Financing
against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement or the Debt Financing

damages from, or otherwise sue, any Financing Sources Related Party. The
Financing Sources Related Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of
this Section 9.11.

WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE
