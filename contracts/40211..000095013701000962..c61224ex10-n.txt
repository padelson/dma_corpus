                     FIRST AMENDED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

         THIS FIRST AMENDED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT is entered into on the 28th
day of February, 2001, between GATX RAIL CORPORATION, a corporation organized
under the laws of New York ("Rail"), GATX TERMINALS HOLDING CORPORATION, a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rail ("Holdings" and,
together with Rail, "Seller") and KINDER MORGAN ENERGY PARTNERS, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership ("Purchaser").

         WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Seller
desires to sell, assign and transfer to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to
purchase and take assignment and delivery from Seller of, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of GATX Terminals Corporation, a Delaware
corporation, which shall be converted into a single-member limited liability
company prior to the Terminals Closing Date ("Terminals"); and

         WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Seller
desires to sell, assign and transfer to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to
purchase and take assignment and delivery from Seller of, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of GATX Pipe Line Company, a Delaware
corporation, which shall be converted into a single-member limited liability
company prior to the Calnev Closing Date ("GPL").

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
promises herein contained, Purchaser and Seller agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1
                         PURCHASE AND SALE OF TERMINALS

         1.1  Purchase and Sale of Terminals Stock. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, at the Terminals Closing (as defined below), Seller shall
sell, assign and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase and take
assignment and delivery of, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock, such capital stock having been converted into a limited liability company
membership interest prior to the Terminals Closing Date, of Terminals (the
"Terminals Stock").

         1.2  Payment at the Terminals Closing. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by Section
1.1 hereof (the "Terminals Closing"), Purchaser shall pay, by wire transfer of
same-day funds, the amount of $784,000,000 less $168,970,000 (which is the
Terminals Aggregate Non-Current Balance Sheet Liability reflected on the
Terminals Closing Balance Sheet) (the "Terminals Purchase Price"). The Terminals
Purchase Price shall be payable to Seller to such accounts as Seller may direct
in advance of the Terminals Closing. The Terminals Purchase Price is subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 1.3 below.

         1.3  Determination of Working Capital Adjustment.


              (a)    Closing Balance Sheet. In order to determine the Terminals
         Working Capital Adjustment, Seller has prepared and delivered to
         Purchaser the Terminals Closing Balance Sheet. The Terminals Closing
         Balance Sheet was prepared using accounting

<PAGE>   13

         principles and significant estimates in accordance with GAAP and
         consistent with those used in the preparation of the Terminals
         September 30th Balance Sheet and shall take into account the Terminals
         Adjustments. Seller shall permit Purchaser's accountants reasonable
         access (i) to Seller's accountants and (ii) to review all work papers
         and other pertinent information requested from time to time and used in
         connection with the preparation of the Terminals Closing Balance Sheet.

              (b)    Working Capital Adjustment. If Terminals Working Capital as
         shown on the Terminals Closing Balance Sheet is less than the Terminals
         Working Capital as shown on the Terminals September 30th Balance Sheet,
         then Seller shall remit to Purchaser the Terminals Working Capital
         Adjustment. Seller shall remit the undisputed portion of such amount,
         together with interest thereon at the prime interest rate as reported
         in The Wall Street Journal on the Terminals Closing Date (the "Prime
         Interest Rate") plus 2%, calculated on an annual basis (based on a
         365-day year) but prorated for the actual number of days for which
         interest is to be paid (i.e., the number of days from the Terminals
         Closing Date to the date of payment), by wire transfer of same-day
         funds, not later than the fifteenth (15th) business day after the
         Terminals Closing Date, to an account that Purchaser shall designate to
         Seller. Seller shall retain the disputed portion of such amount until
         the dispute is resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section
         1.3(c) below. If Terminals Working Capital as shown on the Terminals
         Closing Balance Sheet is greater than the Terminals Working Capital as
         shown on the Terminals September 30th Balance Sheet, then Purchaser
         shall remit to Seller the Terminals Working Capital Adjustment.
         Purchaser shall remit the undisputed portion of such amount, together
         with interest thereon at the Prime Interest Rate plus 2% calculated on
         an annual basis (based on a 365-day year) but prorated for the actual
         number of days for which interest is to be paid (i.e., the number of
         days from the Terminals Closing Date to the date of payment), by wire
         transfer of same-day funds, not later than the fifteenth (15th)
         business day after the Terminals Closing Date, to an account that
         Seller shall designate to Purchaser. Purchaser shall retain the
         disputed portion of such amount until the dispute is resolved pursuant
         to Section 1.3(c) below.

              (c)    Disputes. If Purchaser notifies Seller in writing within
         fifteen (15) business days after the Terminals Closing Date that
         Purchaser disagrees with the determination of Terminals Working Capital
         as shown on the Terminals Closing Balance Sheet, for the reason that
         the determination does not meet the criteria set forth in Section
         2.9(c) ("Terminals Dispute Notice") and such Terminals Dispute Notice
         (i) states with reasonable specificity the basis for such disagreement
         and quantifies such dispute and (ii) seeks an adjustment to the
         Terminals Working Capital reflected on the Terminals Closing Balance
         Sheet of at least $340,000, Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good
         faith to resolve such dispute as soon as possible. If the parties are
         unable to resolve such dispute within fifteen (15) days after Seller's
         receipt of such Terminals Dispute Notice, Seller and Purchaser shall,
         as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, jointly submit such
         dispute for arbitration to an independent certified public accounting
         firm mutually acceptable to Seller and Purchaser (or, if the parties
         cannot agree within one week on such an arbitrating accounting firm, to
         the Chicago office of Arthur Andersen LLP (the "Terminals Arbitrating
         Accounting Firm")) for the purpose of resolving the dispute set forth
         in such Terminals Dispute Notice. The review performed by the Terminals


                                       2
<PAGE>   14

         Arbitrating Accounting Firm shall be limited to the unresolved issues
         identified in the Terminals Dispute Notice, which issues shall relate
         only to the accounting determinations specified in the first sentence
         of this Section 1.3(c). The Terminals Arbitrating Accounting Firm shall
         review and decide the issue or issues that are the subject of such
         dispute as specified in such Terminals Dispute Notice within thirty
         (30) days after such submission. The decision of the Terminals
         Arbitrating Accounting Firm shall be set forth in writing and delivered
         to Seller and Purchaser. The decision of the Terminals Arbitrating
         Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on Seller and Purchaser, and
         the Terminals Working Capital reflected on the Terminals Closing
         Balance Sheet, as adjusted to reflect the determination of the
         Terminals Arbitrating Accounting Firm, shall constitute the final and
         binding "Terminals Working Capital" for purposes of Section 1.3(b);
         provided, that the Terminals Working Capital reflected on the Terminals
         Closing Balance Sheet shall not be adjusted unless and until the
         decision of the Terminals Arbitrating Accounting Firm would result in
         an adjustment to the Terminals Working Capital shown on the Terminals
         Closing Balance Sheet submitted by Seller of at least $340,000. If the
         final and binding Terminals Working Capital as determined by the
         Terminals Arbitrating Accounting Firm would result in a refund of
         certain of the amounts paid by Purchaser to Seller with respect to the
         delivery of the Terminals Closing Balance Sheet (the "Terminals Initial
         Payment"), then, not later than the third (3rd) business day after
         delivery of the decision of the Terminals Arbitrating Accounting Firm,
         Seller shall remit such refund, together with interest thereon at the
         Prime Interest Rate plus 2% calculated on an annual basis (based on a
         365-day year) but prorated for the actual number of days for which
         interest is to be paid (i.e., the number of days from the date of
         Terminals Initial Payment to the date of payment), by wire transfer of
         same-day funds to an account that Purchaser shall designate to Seller.
         If the final and binding Terminals Working Capital as determined by the
         Terminals Arbitrating Accounting Firm would result in an additional
         payment from Purchaser to Seller, then, not later than the third (3rd)
         business day after delivery of the decision of the Terminals
         Arbitrating Accounting Firm, Purchaser shall remit such additional
         amount, together with interest thereon at the Prime Interest Rate plus
         2%, calculated on an annual basis (based on a 365-day year) but
         prorated for the actual number of days for which interest is to be paid
         (i.e., the number of days from the Terminals Closing Date to the date
         of payment), by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account that
         Seller shall designate to Purchaser. The fees and costs of the
         Terminals Arbitrating Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by
         Purchaser and Seller.

              (d)    Adjustments Not Subject to Limitation. Any amounts paid to
         Purchaser as a result of adjustments under this Section 1.3 shall not
         be subject to, or impact in any way, any limitations, including without
         limitation any basket or cap, contained in this Agreement. The
         Terminals Purchase Price shall be deemed adjusted downwards or upwards,
         as the case may be, by the amounts, if any, remitted by Seller or
         Purchaser under this Section 1.3. Notwithstanding anything to the
         contrary contained in this Agreement, if and to the extent Seller pays
         a Terminals Working Capital Adjustment to Purchaser, then Seller shall
         have no additional liability to Purchaser whatsoever (pursuant to
         Section 2.9 or Section 9.2 hereof or otherwise) with respect to the
         Terminals Working Capital shortfall that resulted in a reduction in the
         Terminals Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 1.3.

         1A.3 Determination of Working Capital Adjustment and Debt Adjustment.


              (a)    Closing Balance Sheet. In order to determine the Calnev
         Working Capital Adjustment and the Calnev Debt Adjustment, Seller shall
         prepare and deliver to Purchaser, within sixty (60) days following the
         Calnev Closing Date, the Calnev Closing Balance Sheet. The Calnev
         Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared by Seller at its own expense
         with the assistance of personnel of Calnev as may be reasonably
         requested by Seller. The Calnev Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared
         using accounting principles and significant estimates in accordance
         with GAAP and consistent with those used in the preparation of the
         Calnev September 30th Balance Sheet and shall take into account the
         Calnev Adjustments. During and after preparation of such Calnev Closing
         Balance Sheet, Seller shall permit Purchaser's accountants reasonable
         access (i) to Seller's accountants and (ii) to review all work papers
         and other pertinent information requested from time to time and used in
         connection with the preparation of the Calnev Closing Balance Sheet.

              (b)    Working Capital Adjustment. If Calnev Working Capital as
         shown on the Calnev Closing Balance Sheet is less than Calnev Working
         Capital as shown on the Calnev September 30th Balance Sheet, then
         Seller shall remit to Purchaser the Calnev Working Capital Adjustment.
         Seller shall remit the undisputed portion of such amount, together with
         interest thereon at the Prime Interest Rate plus 2%, calculated on an
         annual basis (based on a 365-day year) but prorated for the actual
         number of days for which interest is to be paid (i.e., the number of
         days from the Calnev Closing Date to the date of payment), by wire
         transfer of same-day funds, not later than the fifteenth (15th)
         business day after delivery to Purchaser of the Calnev Closing Balance
         Sheet, to an account that Purchaser shall designate to Seller. Seller
         shall retain the disputed portion of such amount until the dispute is
         resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 1A.3(d) below.
         If Calnev Working Capital as shown on the Calnev Closing Balance Sheet
         is greater than the Calnev Working Capital as shown on the Calnev
         September 30th Balance Sheet, then Purchaser shall remit to Seller the
         Calnev Working Capital Adjustment. Purchaser shall remit the undisputed
         portion of such amount, together with interest thereon at the Prime
         Interest Rate plus 2% calculated on an annual basis (based on a 365-day
         year) but prorated for the actual number of days for which interest is
         to be paid (i.e., the number of days from the Calnev Closing Date to
         the date of payment), by wire transfer of same-day funds, not later
         than the fifteenth (15th) business day after delivery to Purchaser of
         the Calnev Closing Balance Sheet, to an account that Seller shall
         designate to Purchaser. Purchaser shall retain the disputed portion of
         such amount until the dispute is resolved pursuant to Section 1A.3(d)
         below.

              (c)    Debt Adjustment. If the Calnev Aggregate Non-Current
         Balance Sheet Liability as shown on the Calnev Closing Balance Sheet is
         greater than the Calnev Aggregate Non-Current Balance Sheet Liability
         as shown on the Calnev September 30th Balance Sheet, then Seller shall
         remit to Purchaser the Calnev Debt Adjustment. Seller shall remit the
         undisputed portion of such amount, together with interest thereon at
         the Prime Interest Rate plus 2%, calculated on an annual basis (based
         on a 365-day year) but prorated for the actual number of days for which
         interest is to be paid (i.e., the number of days from the Calnev
         Closing Date to the date of payment), by wire transfer of same-day



                                       5
<PAGE>   17

         funds, not later than the fifteenth (15th) business day after delivery
         to Purchaser of the Calnev Closing Balance Sheet, to an account that
         Purchaser shall designate to Seller. Seller shall retain the disputed
         portion of such amount until the dispute is resolved pursuant to the
         procedures set forth in Section 1A.3(d) below. If the Calnev Aggregate
         Non-Current Balance Sheet Liability as shown on the Calnev Closing
         Balance Sheet is less than the Calnev Aggregate Non-Current Balance
         Sheet Liability as shown on the Calnev September 30th Balance Sheet,
         then Purchaser shall remit to Seller the Calnev Debt Adjustment.
         Purchaser shall remit the undisputed portion of such amount, together
         with interest thereon at the Prime Interest Rate plus 2% calculated on
         an annual basis (based on a 365-day year) but prorated for the actual
         number of days for which interest is to be paid (i.e., the number of
         days from the Calnev Closing Date to the date of payment), by wire
         transfer of same-day funds, not later than fifteenth (15th) business
         day after delivery to Purchaser of the Calnev Closing Balance Sheet, to
         an account that Seller shall designate to Purchaser. Purchaser shall
         retain the disputed portion of such amount until the dispute is
         resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 1A.3(d).

              (d)    Disputes. If Purchaser notifies Seller in writing within
         fifteen (15) business days after receipt of the Calnev Closing Balance
         Sheet that Purchaser disagrees with the determination of Calnev Working
         Capital or Calnev Aggregate Non-Current Balance Sheet Liability, in
         each case as shown on the Calnev Closing Balance Sheet, for the reason
         that the determination does not meet the criteria set forth in Section
         2A.9(b) ("Calnev Dispute Notice"), and such Calnev Dispute Notice (i)
         states with reasonable specificity the basis for such disagreement and
         quantifies such dispute and (ii) with respect to Calnev Working
         Capital, seeks an adjustment to the Calnev Working Capital reflected on
         the Calnev Closing Balance Sheet of at least $160,000, Seller and
         Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute as soon
         as possible. If the parties are unable to resolve such dispute within
         fifteen (15) days after Seller's receipt of such Calnev Dispute Notice,
         Seller and Purchaser shall as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter
         jointly submit such dispute for arbitration to an independent certified
         public accounting firm mutually acceptable to Seller and Purchaser (or,
         if the parties cannot agree within one week on such an arbitrating
         accounting firm, to the Chicago office of Arthur Andersen LLP (the
         "Calnev Arbitrating Accounting Firm")) for the purpose of resolving the
         dispute set forth in such Calnev Dispute Notice. The review performed
         by the Calnev Arbitrating Accounting Firm shall be limited to the
         unresolved issues identified in the Calnev Dispute Notice, which issues
         shall relate only to the accounting determinations specified in the
         first sentence of this Section 1A.3(d). The Calnev Arbitrating
         Accounting Firm shall review and decide the issue or issues that are
         the subject of such dispute as specified in such Calnev Dispute Notice
         within thirty (30) days after such submission. Seller and Purchaser
         hereby agree, and the Calnev Arbitrating Accounting Firm shall be
         directed, that the Calnev Closing Balance Sheet estimates for reserves
         included in the Calnev Aggregate Non-Current Balance Sheet Liability
         shall be conclusive unless it is established that, based solely on
         information available at the Calnev Closing, there was no reasonable
         basis for the change (if any) in such estimates from September 30, 2000
         to the date of the Calnev Closing. The decision of the Calnev
         Arbitrating Accounting Firm shall be set forth in writing and delivered
         to Seller and Purchaser. The decision of the Calnev Arbitrating
         Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on Seller and Purchaser, and
         the Calnev Working Capital and/or the Calnev




                                       6

         Aggregate Non-Current Balance Sheet Liability reflected on the Calnev
         Closing Balance Sheet, as adjusted to reflect the determination of the
         Calnev Arbitrating Accounting Firm, shall constitute the final and
         binding "Calnev Working Capital" for purposes of Section 1A.3(b) and/or
         "Calnev Aggregate Non-Current Balance Sheet Liability" for purposes of
         Section 1A.3(c) (as applicable); provided, that the Calnev Working
         Capital reflected on the Calnev Closing Balance Sheet shall not be
         adjusted unless and until the decision of the Calnev Arbitrating
         Accounting Firm would result in an adjustment to the Calnev Working
         Capital shown on the Calnev Closing Balance Sheet submitted by Seller
         of at least $160,000. If the final and binding Calnev Working Capital
         and/or Calnev Aggregate Non-Current Balance Sheet Liability as
         determined by the Calnev Arbitrating Accounting Firm would result in a
         refund of certain of the amounts paid by Purchaser to Seller with
         respect to the delivery of the Calnev Closing Balance Sheet (the
         "Calnev Initial Payment"), then, not later than the third (3rd)
         business day after delivery of the decision of the Calnev Arbitrating
         Accounting Firm, Seller shall remit such refund, together with interest
         thereon at the Prime Interest Rate plus 2% calculated on an annual
         basis (based on a 365-day year) but prorated for the actual number of
         days for which interest is to be paid (i.e., the number of days from
         the date of Calnev Initial Payment to the date of payment), by wire
         transfer of same-day funds to an account that Purchaser shall designate
         to Seller. If the final and binding Calnev Working Capital and/or
         Calnev Aggregate Non-Current Balance Sheet Liability as determined by
         the Calnev Arbitrating Accounting Firm would result in an additional
         payment from Purchaser to Seller, then, not later than the third (3rd)
         business day after delivery of the decision of the Calnev Arbitrating
         Accounting Firm, Purchaser shall remit such additional amount, together
         with interest thereon at the Prime Interest Rate plus 2%, calculated on
         an annual basis (based on a 365-day year) but prorated for the actual
         number of days for which interest is to be paid (i.e., the number of
         days from the Calnev Closing Date to the date of payment), by wire
         transfer of same-day funds to an account that Seller shall designate to
         Purchaser. The fees and costs of the Calnev Arbitrating Accounting Firm
         shall be shared equally by Purchaser and Seller.

              (e)    Adjustments Not Subject to Limitation. Any amounts paid to
         Purchaser as a result of adjustments under this Section 1A.3 shall not
         be subject to, or impact in any way, any limitations, including without
         limitation any basket or cap, contained in this Agreement. The Calnev
         Purchase Price shall be deemed adjusted downwards or upwards, as the
         case may be, by the amounts, if any, remitted by Seller or Purchaser
         under this Section 1A.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
         contained in this Agreement, if and to the extent Seller pays a Calnev
         Working Capital Adjustment or a Calnev Debt Adjustment to Purchaser,
         then Seller shall have no additional liability to Purchaser whatsoever
         (pursuant to Section 2A.9 or Section 9A.2 hereof or otherwise) with
         respect to the Calnev Working Capital shortfall or the incremental
         Calnev Aggregate Non-Current Balance Sheet Liability that resulted in a
         reduction in the Calnev Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 1A.3.

         1A.4 Purchase Price Allocation. Seller and Purchaser agree to allocate
the Calnev Purchase Price for the assets of the Calnev Companies as set forth on
Schedule 1A.4 (the "Calnev Asset Allocation"). The Calnev Asset Allocation shall
be revised after all adjustments, if any, have been made to the Calnev Purchase
Price in accordance with Section 1A.3. The


                                       7
<PAGE>   19

Calnev Asset Allocation shall be completed in the manner required by Section
1060 of the Code. Seller and Purchaser further agree to comply with all filing,
notice and reporting requirements described in Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, including the timely preparation
and filing of Form 8594 based on the Calnev Asset Allocation. Seller and
Purchaser hereby agree that they will report the federal, state, foreign and
other tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a
manner consistent with the Calnev Asset Allocation.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER WITH RESPECT TO THE TERMINALS COMPANIES

         Holdings and Rail jointly and severally represent and warrant to

set forth in (i) the third sentence of Section 2.3, (ii) the first sentence of
Section 2.4, (iii) clause (b) of the second sentence of Section 2.7, (iv)

accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by (a) applicable

time in effect which affect creditors' rights generally or (b) legal and
equitable limitations on the availability of specific remedies.

         2.2 Capitalization; Seller's Ownership of Terminals Companies.

              (a)    Schedule 2.2 sets forth each Person, other than certain
         Excluded Companies, of which Terminals, directly or indirectly, (i)
         owns all of the capital stock and (ii) upon conversion of such Persons
         into single-member limited liability companies prior to the Terminals
         Closing, will own all of the membership interests (all such Persons,
         both prior to and after having been converted into single-member
         limited liability companies, together with Terminals, being referred to
         as the "Terminals Companies" and each individually as a "Terminals
         Company"). The authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of each

<PAGE>   20

         Schedule for the purposes of this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to
         exclude the Calnev Companies) and the issued and outstanding capital
         stock of each of the Terminals Companies is duly authorized, fully paid
         and nonassessable. Upon conversion into single-member limited liability
         companies and at the Terminals Closing, the membership interests of
         each of the Terminals Companies will be fully paid and nonassessable,
         owned beneficially and of record by Holdings, with respect to
         Terminals, and, directly or indirectly, by Terminals, with respect to
         the Terminals Companies other than Terminals.

              (b)    There are no outstanding options, rights, warrants,
         Contracts or commitments for the issuance or sale by Seller or any of
         the Terminals Companies of, or any securities of any of the Terminals
         Companies convertible into or exchangeable for, any shares of capital
         stock of any of the Terminals Companies (whether treasury or issued and
         outstanding), and there is no agreement or arrangement not yet fully
         performed which would result in the creation of any of the foregoing.

              (c)    Holdings owns and has, and at the Terminals Closing shall
         transfer to Purchaser, good and valid title to the Terminals Stock,
         free and clear of all Liens. The Terminals Stock constitutes all the
         issued and outstanding capital stock of Terminals.

         2.3 Organization. Each of the Terminals Companies is a corporation or
other business entity validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization. Schedule 2.3 sets forth the jurisdictions in which each of the

requisite corporate power to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as now being conducted, is duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where the conduct of its business or
ownership of its properties requires such qualification, except where the
failure to qualify would not reasonably be expected to have a Terminals Material
Adverse Effect.

         2.4 Consents and Approvals. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Rail and Holdings does not, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by Section 1.1 hereof and performance by Rail and
Holdings of their obligations hereunder, assuming the receipt of the consents,
approvals and waivers listed on Schedule 2.4, will not: (a) violate or
constitute a default under any term, condition or provision of (i) the charter,
bylaws or analogous organizational documents of Rail, Holdings or any of the
Terminals Companies; or (ii) any Contract, lease, collective bargaining
agreement (or agreements relating thereto), instrument, mortgage, permit,
Governmental authorization, license or franchise to which Rail, Holdings or any
of the Terminals Companies is a party or by which any of their respective
properties are bound; (b) result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
Terminals Companies' respective stock, securities, membership interests or
properties or give to others any interest or right in any of the Terminals
Companies' respective stock, securities, membership interests or properties,
including, but not limited to, a right to purchase any of such stock,
securities, membership interests or properties; (c) require any consent,
Governmental authorization or approval under any Law or any judicial,
administrative or arbitration order, award, judgment, writ, injunction or decree
applicable to Rail, Holdings or any of the Terminals Companies; or (d) result in
the suspension, modification, revocation or nonrenewal of any license, permit or
Governmental authorization issued or granted to any of the Terminals Companies
by Governmental Authorities

that are necessary for the conduct of the business of the Terminals Companies,
except, with respect of each of clauses (a)(ii)-(d), for matters that are not
reasonably expected to have a Terminals Material Adverse Effect. Except as set
forth on Schedule 2.4, the failure of any Person not a party hereto to authorize
or approve this Agreement will not give any Person the right to enjoin, rescind
or otherwise prevent or impede the sale of the Terminals Stock to Purchaser in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or to reach in any fashion the
Terminals Stock in the hands of the Purchaser following the Terminals Closing or
to obtain damages from, or any other judicial relief against, Purchaser as a
result of the transactions carried out in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement.

         2.5 Personal Property. The Terminals Companies have good and valid
title to their material respective personal properties reflected in the

date thereof (except for properties sold or otherwise disposed of since the date
thereof in the ordinary course of business) free and clear of all Liens, except
for Terminals Permitted Liens.

         2.6 Real Property. Schedule 2.6 contains a true and correct list of all
Terminals Real Property that is owned by the Terminals Companies. Except as set
forth on Schedule 2.6, to Seller's knowledge, the Terminals Real Property is

         issued by Seller or any of the Terminals Companies. The Pension Benefit
         Guaranty Corporation has not instituted, and is not expected to
         institute, any proceedings to terminate any Terminals Companies Plan.

                  (k) No Terminals Companies Plan that is a pension plan (with
         the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) and that is not a multiemployer
         plan has suffered any "accumulated funding deficiency," within the
         meaning of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, whether or
         not waived, and if any such Terminals Companies Plan were terminated on
         the Closing Date, none of the Terminals Companies would have any
         liability to any participants or beneficiaries as a result of the
         termination except to the extent of funds set aside for such purpose or
         reflected as reserved for such purpose on the Terminals Closing Balance
         Sheet.

                  (l) No termination liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
         has been or is expected to be incurred if any Terminals Companies Plan
         were terminated on the Terminals Closing Date. There has been no
         "reportable event," as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA, with respect
         to any Terminals Companies Plan that is not a multiemployer plan, for
         which notice has not been waived.

         the Code on account of an accumulated funding deficiency of any
         multiemployer plan to which any Terminals Company or ERISA Affiliate
         has contributed or is required to contribute.

                  (n) Except as specifically described on Schedule 2.13
         (including Schedule 2.13(a) or as required by Section 411(d)(3) of the
         Code, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
         accelerate or increase any liability under any Terminals Companies Plan
         because of an acceleration or increase of any of the rights or benefits
         to which employees may be entitled thereunder.

                  (o) No breach or violation of or default under any Terminals
         Companies Plan which is not sponsored or maintained by any of the
         Terminals Companies (other than a multiemployer plan) will subject
         Purchaser or any of the Terminals Companies to any Taxes, Liens,
         encumbrances, penalties or any other liabilities.

                  (p) Except as specifically described on Schedule 2.13
         (including Schedule 2.13(a)) or as required by law, no Terminals

         former employee, and no Terminals Company is obligated to provide
         health or welfare benefits to any active employee following such
         employee's retirement or other termination of service. To the extent
         that such obligations exist, such obligations (except with respect to
         (i) health and life insurance applicable to employees who terminate
         employment other than on account of retirement and (ii) severance
         benefits) are fully funded or adequately reserved for with respect to
         the Terminals Companies. Other than pursuant to a collective bargaining
         agreement, no Terminals Company has adopted or distributed a formal
         plan, policy or program representing, promising or affirming to any
         employees or former employees the duration of retiree health or welfare
         benefits.

         stock of any of the Calnev Companies (whether treasury or issued and
         outstanding), and there is no agreement or arrangement not yet fully
         performed which would result in the creation of any of the foregoing.

enjoin, rescind or otherwise prevent or impede the sale of the GPL Stock to
Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or to reach in any

                  (c) All Calnev Plans comply in form and operation in all
         material respects with their terms and all applicable requirements of
         Law; provided, however, that as to multiemployer plans, this

         representation is made as to Seller's knowledge.

                  (e) To Seller's knowledge, there have been no "prohibited

         Code, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
         accelerate or increase any liability under any Calnev Plan because of

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

         Purchaser represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

         3.1 Authority of Purchaser. Purchaser is a limited partnership duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware, with all requisite limited




                                       31
<PAGE>   43

partnership power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted. Purchaser has all requisite
limited partnership power to enter into this Agreement and to carry out its
obligations under this Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by Purchaser has been duly authorized by all necessary limited
partnership action. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Purchaser and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of Purchaser enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except
as may be limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws from time to time in effect that affect
creditors' rights generally or (b) legal and equitable limitations on the
availability of specific remedies. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Purchaser does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and performance by Purchaser of its obligations hereunder will not,
violate or conflict with any provision of: (i) the certificate of limited
partnership or the Limited Partnership Agreement of Purchaser; (ii) any material
agreement, lease, instrument, mortgage, license or franchise to which Purchaser
is a party or by which any of its properties is bound; or (iii) any Law
applicable to Purchaser and which violation or conflict would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of
Purchaser. The failure of any Person not a party hereto to authorize or approve
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby will not give any Person
the right to enjoin, rescind or otherwise prevent or impede the purchase of the
Stock by Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or to obtain
damages from, or any other judicial relief against, Seller or Purchaser as a
result of any transactions carried out in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement.

         3.2 Brokers, Etc. Except for Merrill Lynch & Co., the fees and expenses
of which shall be the responsibility of Purchaser, no broker or investment
banker acting on behalf of Purchaser is or will be entitled to any broker's or
finder's fee or any other commission or similar fee directly or indirectly in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         3.3 Securities. Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the Stock is not
registered under the Securities Act or registered or qualified for sale under
any applicable securities Law of the United States or any state or province of
the United States and cannot be resold without registration thereunder or
exemption therefrom. Purchaser is acquiring such Stock for its own account as
principal, for investment and has no present intention to dispose of the Stock,
in whole or in part, or of any interest in the Stock to any other person.
Purchaser has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters to enable it to evaluate the risks of investment in such Stock and has
the ability to bear the economic risks of such investment.

         3.4 Financing. Purchaser has all necessary financial resources (which
resources are listed on Schedule 3.4) available in connection with the
acquisition of the Stock to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
financial statements of Purchaser as of December 31, 1999 and for the period
then ended, which have been previously delivered to Seller, fairly present the
financial condition and results of operations of Purchaser as of the date and
for the period then ended in accordance with GAAP.

         3.5 Independent Investigation. In making the decision to enter into
this Agreement and the Related Agreements and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, other than reliance on the representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations and



                                       32
<PAGE>   44

indemnities of Seller set forth in this Agreement and in Seller's Related
Agreements, Purchaser has performed its own independent investigation, analysis
and evaluation of the Terminals Companies and the Calnev Companies (including
Purchaser's own estimate and appraisal of the value of the business, financial
condition, assets, operations and prospects of the Terminals Companies and the
Calnev Companies). Purchaser confirms to Seller that Purchaser is sophisticated
and knowledgeable in the business of the Terminals Companies and the Calnev
Companies and is capable of evaluating the matters set forth above.

<PAGE>   45

in Argo, Illinois, the cash or other proceeds received shall be retained in the
respective Terminals Company and shall not be distributed to Seller or its
Affiliates); (f) make any material changes in its accounting principles or
practices; (g) other than with respect to the transfer from Terminals to Rail

become liable for any material obligations of any other Person; (i) make any
loans, advances or capital contributions to, or investments in, any other Person
or (j) (i) except as set forth on Schedule 4.3, increase the compensation of any

adopt any new employee benefit plan or materially amend any existing employee

aggregate consideration to be paid is greater than $100,000. Prior to the
Terminals Closing Date, Seller shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, provide
written notice to Purchaser in the event any of the Terminals Companies has made
or is planning to make a capital expenditure that is more than $500,000.

         4.4 HSR Filings. As promptly as practicable, Seller shall (in
cooperation with Purchaser) (i) make all filings and submissions with the
Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") under the

reasonably required to be made with all other Governmental Authorities in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, requesting
early termination of any waiting period thereunder, (ii) respond promptly to any
inquiries from the DOJ, the FTC or other Governmental Authorities in connection
with such filings and (iii) comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the HSR Act. Subject to regulatory constraints, Seller and
Purchaser shall each keep the other party fully advised with respect to any
requests from or communications with the DOJ, FTC or other Governmental
Authority and shall consult with the other party with respect to all filings and
responses thereto.

         4.5 [Intentionally omitted].

         4.6 Registration Statements and Periodic Reports. In connection with
the preparation and filing of any registration statement or periodic report of
Purchaser or its Affiliates pursuant to any rule or regulation promulgated under
the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
including, but not limited to, Regulation S-X, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser and its accountants in satisfying
Purchaser's financial reporting requirements with respect to this Agreement and
as otherwise may be required from time to time.

         4.7 Intercompany Accounts and Contracts. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.7, prior to or on the Terminals Closing Date (a) the Terminals
Companies shall pay or otherwise




                                       34
<PAGE>   46
extinguish the outstanding payables owed to Seller or any of its Affiliates and
(b) Seller and any of its Affiliates shall pay or otherwise extinguish the
outstanding payables owed to the Terminals Companies. All intercompany Contracts

Companies, on the other hand, shall terminate as of the Terminals Closing with
full releases of liability and obligation, except for those Contracts listed on
Schedule 4.7.

         4.8 Conversion into Single-Member Limited Liability Companies. Prior to
the Terminals Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Terminals Companies to be
converted into single-member limited liability companies (by state law
conversions in the case of Terminals Companies that are Delaware corporations
and by mergers in the case of Rahway River Land Company and Southwest Florida
Pipeline Company) with all related documents and instruments to be in form and
substance mutually satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser, provided, however, that
Seller shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section
4.8 if the conversion of any Terminals Company into a limited liability company
(whether by state law conversion or by merger) is or has been enjoined or
restrained by a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon the conversion of the
Terminals Companies into single-member limited liability companies and
thereafter, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will make an election or
take any action resulting in any Terminals Company being treated as anything
other than an entity disregarded from its owner for federal income tax purposes,
and Seller and its Affiliates will file all federal income and relevant state
income Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Terminals Companies'
disregarded entity status. All references in this Agreement to the Terminals
Companies and their capital stock shall thereafter refer to the Terminals
Companies as limited liability companies and to their membership interests,
respectively.

         4.9 No Solicitations. Seller will not take, nor will it permit the
Terminals Companies or any Affiliate of Seller (or authorize or permit any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other Person
retained by or acting for or on behalf of Seller, the Terminals Companies or any
such Affiliate) to take, directly or indirectly, any action to (i) solicit,
encourage, negotiate, assist or otherwise facilitate (including by furnishing
confidential information with respect to the Terminals Companies or permitting
access to the assets and properties and books and records of the Terminals
Companies) any offer or inquiry from any Person concerning a Terminals
Acquisition Proposal ("Terminals Company Competing Transaction") or (ii) enter
into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (a) which binds Seller, the
Terminals Companies or their Affiliates to a Terminals Company Competing
Transaction or (b) requires them to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller, the Terminals Companies and
their Affiliates will immediately cease all existing activities, discussions and
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Terminals
Company Competing Transaction.

         4.10 Confidentiality. After the Terminals Closing Date, Seller shall
not, directly or indirectly, use or provide to, and shall not permit any
Affiliate, directly or indirectly, to use or provide to any other Person any
material nonpublic information concerning the business or operations (financial
or other) of the Terminals Companies, except (a) as on the advice of counsel is
required in governmental filings or judicial, administrative or arbitration
proceedings and (b) as may be necessary or desirable for the sale or transfer of
any Excluded Company (so long as the recipient of such information is bound to a
commercially reasonable confidentiality agreement with respect to such
information).

         4.11 Insurance.

                  (a) From the date hereof to the Terminals Closing Date, Seller
         shall cause the Terminals Companies to maintain in full force and
         effect all of their respective Terminals Insurance Policies now in
         effect or renewals thereof covering their assets, operations and
         employees. Upon the conversion or merger of each Terminals Company into
         a limited liability company as required by Section 4.8 hereof, Seller
         shall notify the insurance carriers for such Terminals Company of the
         change in the identity of such company as a result of such conversion
         or merger.

                  (b) Before or after the Terminals Closing. Seller shall
         provide to Purchaser access to (and, at Purchaser's expense, copies of)
         the insurance policies and related records of Seller and its Affiliates
         that relate to the business and properties now or previously owned,
         leased and/or operated by any Terminals Company (including business or
         property included in the General American Transportation Corporation
         prior to July 1, 1975) in order for Purchaser to assess whether claims
         for the benefit of any Terminals Company can be made under any of the
         applicable insurance policies. If Purchaser determines that any such
         claims can be made under any of the insurance policies for the benefit
         of any of the Terminals Companies, then, at Purchaser's expense, Seller
         shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
         Purchaser and any Terminals Company in preparing and documenting any
         such claim and (ii) on behalf of any Terminals Company, make, file and
         use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any such claim; provided,
         however, that (x) Seller or its Affiliates will not be required to
         make, file or pursue those claims which, if paid by the insurer, would
         result in a retroactive premium adjustment, payment obligation
         (including self-insured retention or deductible) or other charge-back
         to Seller or its Affiliates unless Purchaser agrees in writing to
         reimburse Seller for such adjustment or charge-back, (y) in settling
         any such claim with an insurer, Seller and its Affiliates will not be
         required to release any rights, and Purchaser shall not cause the
         release of any rights, to make claims under the insurance policy for
         matters that are not related to the claim that is being settled for the
         Terminals Company and (z) Seller or its Affiliates will not be required
         to commence litigation or to make any expenditure or payment unless
         Purchaser agrees to fully indemnify Seller and its Affiliates for any
         such expenditure or payment and also for any Losses incurred by Seller
         or any of its Affiliates in connection with any such litigation
         (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees).
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser agrees that no claim
         contemplated under this Section 4.11 shall be made against Trail Ltd.,
         a rail car leasing captive insurer partially owned by GATX Corporation
         which provided insurance coverage during the periods in question.

         4.12 Excluded Companies. Prior to the Terminals Closing (or in the case
of GPS, no later than April 30, 2001), Seller shall cause the Excluded Companies
and all assets, Contracts and liabilities related thereto to be transferred
outside of Terminals such that, at the Terminals Closing, Terminals no longer
owns or is responsible for, directly or indirectly, the Excluded Companies or
any assets, Contracts or liabilities related thereto.

         4.13 No Solicitation of Continuing Employees. Subsequent to the
Terminals Closing and for a period of one (1) year thereafter Seller shall not
(and Seller shall cause its Affiliates not




                                       36
<PAGE>   48

to) solicit (i.e. initiate discussions with) for hire any of the Terminals
Continuing Employees so long as such Terminals Continuing Employees are employed
by the Terminals Companies, Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 4.13 shall in no way prohibit
Seller or its Affiliates from engaging in the general trade solicitation of
employees so long as such solicitation is not directed specifically at Terminals
Continuing Employees.

         4.14 Consents. Prior to the Terminals Closing, as reasonably requested
by Purchaser, Seller shall, and shall cause the Terminals Companies to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and assist Purchaser in
Purchaser's efforts to secure all necessary consents, approvals, exemptions and
waivers from third parties (including Governmental Authorities) and to give all
required notices (collectively "Terminals Designated Approvals") as shall be
required to enable Seller to sell the Terminals Stock to Purchaser, consummate
the Terminals Sale or to prevent the sale of Terminals Stock from causing a
breach of, or default under, or a termination of, any contract, lease license or
other agreement identified on any Schedule attached hereto. Nothing in this
Agreement shall require Seller or any of the Terminals Companies to commence
litigation or to make any expenditure or payment (other than reasonable
attorneys' fees) unless Purchaser agrees to fully indemnify Seller and the
Terminals Companies for any such expenditure or payment and also for any Losses
incurred by Seller or any Terminals Company in connection with any such
litigation (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees);
provided, however, that solely with respect to those Terminals Designated
Approvals listed as items 1 (Philadelphia Water Department), 2 (City of
Philadelphia), 3 (Tampa Port Authority), 4 (Tampa Port Authority) and 12 (Port
of Seattle) on Schedule 2.4 hereof, Seller shall be required to pay any
reasonable costs necessary to cure an existing condition at the facility in
question if and only if (i) such existing condition amounts to a failure of the
facility in question to be in compliance with the terms of the permit, license
or agreement as to which the Terminals Designated Approval is being sought and
(ii) the curing of such existing condition is required by the applicable
Governmental Authority, based on the terms of the applicable permit, license or
agreement, as a prerequisite for granting such Terminals Designated Approval.

         4.15 Argo Lease. For a period of not more than two years from the
Terminals Closing Date, Seller shall, at the request of Purchaser and at no cost
or expense to Seller other than reasonable attorneys' fees, use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Terminals in working with the Metropolitan Water
Reclamation District of Greater Chicago ("MWRD") in Terminals' effort to procure
a new lease for the MWRD property at the Argo terminal, including, without
limitation, waiving any potential conflict of interest so that the attorneys
currently representing Terminals in this effort may be available to continue to
do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 4.15
shall require Seller to initiate or participate in any litigation unless
Purchaser agrees to fully indemnify Seller with respect to any Losses incurred
in connection therewith and to pay any and all costs (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in connection therewith.

         4A.4 Intercompany Accounts and Contracts. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.7, prior to or on the Calnev Closing Date (a) the Calnev Companies
shall pay or otherwise extinguish the outstanding payables owed by any Calnev
Company to Seller or any of its Affiliates and (b) Seller and any of its
Affiliates shall pay or otherwise extinguish the outstanding payables owed to
the Calnev Companies. All intercompany Contracts between Seller and/or its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Calnev Companies, on the other hand, shall
terminate as of the Calnev Closing with full releases of liability and
obligation, except for those Contracts listed on Schedule 4.7.

         4A.5 Conversion into Single-Member Limited Liability Companies. Prior
to the Calnev Closing Date, Seller shall cause each of the Calnev Companies to
be converted into single-member limited liability companies (by state law
conversion) with all related documents and instruments to be in form and
substance mutually satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser, provided, however, that
Seller shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section
4A.5 if the conversion of any Calnev Company into a limited liability company is
or has been enjoined or restrained by a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon
the conversion of the Calnev Companies into single-member limited liability
companies and thereafter, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will make an
election or take any action resulting in any Calnev Company being treated as
anything other than an entity disregarded from its owner for federal income tax
purposes, and Seller and its Affiliates will file all federal income and
relevant state income Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Calnev
Companies' disregarded entity status. All references in this Agreement to the
Calnev Companies and their capital stock shall thereafter refer to the Calnev
Companies as a limited liability company and to their membership interests,
respectively.

         4A.6 No Solicitations. Seller will not take, nor will it permit any
Calnev Company or any Affiliate of Seller (or authorize or permit any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other Person retained by or
acting for or on behalf of Seller, the Calnev Companies or any such Affiliate)
to take, directly or indirectly, any action to (i) solicit, encourage,
negotiate, assist or otherwise facilitate (including by furnishing confidential
information with respect to the Calnev Companies or permitting access to the
assets and properties and books and records of the Calnev Companies) any offer
or inquiry from any Person concerning a Calnev Acquisition Proposal ("Calnev
Company Competing Transaction") or (ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (a) which binds Seller, any Calnev Company or their Affiliates to
a Calnev Company Competing Transaction or (b) requires them to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Seller, the Calnev Companies and their respective Affiliates will immediately
cease all existing activities, discussions and negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Calnev Company Competing Transaction.



                                       39
<PAGE>   51
         4A.7 Confidentiality. After the Calnev Closing Date, Seller shall not,
directly or indirectly, use or provide to, and shall not permit any Affiliate,
directly or indirectly, to use or provide to any other Person any material
nonpublic information concerning the business or operations (financial or other)
of the Calnev Companies, except as on the advice of counsel is required in
governmental filings or judicial, administrative or arbitration proceedings.

         4A.8 Insurance.


                  (a) From the date hereof to the Calnev Closing Date, Seller
         shall cause the Calnev Companies to maintain in full force and effect
         all of their respective Calnev Insurance Policies now in effect or
         renewals thereof covering their assets, operations and employees. Upon
         the conversion of each Calnev Company into a limited liability company
         as required by Section 4A.5 hereof, Seller shall notify the insurance
         carriers for such Calnev Company of the change in the identity of such
         company as a result of such conversion or merger.

                  (b) Before or after the Calnev Closing, Seller shall provide
         to Purchaser access to (and, at Purchaser's expense, copies of) the
         insurance policies and related records of Seller and its Affiliates
         that relate to the business and properties now or previously owned,
         leased and/or operated by any Calnev Company (including business or
         property included in the General American Transportation Corporation
         prior to July 1, 1975) in order for Purchaser to assess whether claims
         for the benefit of the Calnev Companies can be made under any of the
         applicable insurance policies. If Purchaser determines that any such
         claims can be made under any of the insurance policies for the benefit
         of any of the Calnev Companies, then, at Purchaser's expense, Seller
         shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
         Purchaser and the Calnev Companies in preparing and documenting any
         such claim and (ii) on behalf of any Calnev Company, make, file and use
         commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any such claim; provided,
         however, that (x) Seller or its Affiliates will not be required to
         make, file or pursue those claims which, if paid by the insurer, would
         result in a retroactive premium adjustment, payment obligation
         (including self-insured retention or deductible) or other charge-back
         to Seller or its Affiliates unless Purchaser agrees in writing to
         reimburse Seller for such adjustment or charge-back, (y) in settling
         any such claim with an insurer, Seller and its Affiliates will not be
         required to release any rights, and Purchaser shall not cause the
         release of any rights, to make claims under the insurance policy for
         matters that are not related to the claim that is being settled for the
         Calnev Company and (z) Seller or its Affiliates will not be required to
         commence litigation or to make any expenditure or payment unless
         Purchaser agrees to fully indemnify Seller and its Affiliates for any
         such expenditure or payment and also for any Losses incurred by Seller
         or any of its Affiliates in connection with any such litigation
         (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees).

         4A.9 No Solicitation of Continuing Employees. Subsequent to the Calnev
Closing and for a period of one (1) year thereafter Seller shall not (and Seller
shall cause its Affiliates not to) solicit (i.e. initiate discussions with) for
hire any of Calnev Continuing Employees so long as such Calnev Continuing
Employees are employed by any Calnev Company, Purchaser or any Affiliate
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 4A.9
shall in no



                                       40
<PAGE>   52

way prohibit Seller or its Affiliates from engaging in the general trade
solicitation of employees so long as such solicitation is not directed
specifically at Calnev Continuing Employees.

         4A.10 Consents Prior to the Calnev Closing. As reasonably requested by
Purchaser, Seller shall, and shall cause the Calnev Companies to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and assist Purchaser in
Purchaser's efforts to secure all necessary consents, approvals, exemptions and
waivers from third parties (including Governmental Authorities) and to give all
required notices as shall be required to enable Seller to sell the GPL Stock to
Purchaser, consummate the Calnev Sale or to prevent the sale of GPL Stock from
causing a breach of, or default under, or a termination of, any contract, lease
license or other agreement identified on any Schedule attached hereto. Nothing
in this Agreement shall require Seller or any Calnev Company to commence
litigation or to make any expenditure or payment (other than reasonable
attorneys' fees) unless Purchaser agrees to fully indemnify Seller and the
Calnev Companies for any such expenditure or payment and also for any Losses
incurred by Seller or any Calnev Company in connection with any such litigation
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees).

         4A.11 HSR Filing With Respect to the Calnev Companies. In the event
that the Calnev Closing has not been consummated prior to December 1, 2001, as
promptly as practicable, Seller shall (in cooperation with Purchaser) (i) make
all filings and submissions with the DOJ and the FTC under the HSR Act and any
applicable state or foreign laws or regulations as may be reasonably required to
be made with all other Governmental Authorities in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, requesting early termination of any
waiting period thereunder, (ii) respond promptly to any inquiries from the DOJ,
the FTC or other Governmental Authorities in connection with such filings and
(iii) comply in all material respects with the HSR Act. Subject to regulatory
constraints, Seller and Purchaser shall keep the other party fully advised with
respect to any requests for or communications with the DOJ, FTC or other
Governmental Authority and shall consult with the other party with respect to
all filings and responses thereto.

                                   ARTICLE 5
         COVENANTS OF PURCHASER WITH RESPECT TO THE TERMINALS COMPANIES

         Purchaser hereby covenants to and agrees with Seller as follows:

         5.1 Corporate and Other Actions. Prior to the Terminals Closing Date,
Purchaser shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement relating to the Terminals Sale and to
consummate the Terminals Sale and the transactions contemplated thereby.

         5.2 Confidentiality. As soon as reasonably practicable after the date
of this Agreement, Purchaser agrees to deliver to Terminals a duly executed
amendment to the Confidentiality Agreement providing that the term of the
Confidentiality Agreement with respect to the Terminals Companies shall not
expire until the Terminals Closing Date.

         5.3 Terminals Employees and Benefit Plans.


                  (a) Purchaser shall be entitled to determine, in its sole
         discretion, the employee staffing that will be required for the
         Terminals Companies after the Terminals Closing and shall make offers
         of continuing employment with the Terminals Companies or with
         Purchaser, its general partner or an Affiliate of either ("Purchaser
         Employer"), effective on the Terminals Closing Date, to any or all
         Terminals Employees in its discretion; provided, however, that
         Purchaser shall make offers of continuing employment to at least 532
         Terminals Employees. As used herein, "Terminals Employees" means the
         employees of the Terminals Companies as of the date hereof who will be
         full-time, active or regular part-time employees on the Terminals
         Closing Date, including those on temporary leave for jury duty, family
         or short-term medical leave or vacation. Schedule 5.3(a) lists the
         Terminals Employees and sets forth, for each of the Terminals
         Employees, his or her job title and, to the extent available, his or
         her current annual rate of base wages or base salary. Any such offers
         of continuing employment shall be made as soon as practicable prior to
         the Terminals Closing Date and shall specify the terms of such
         employment, which terms shall be in accordance with the following
         provisions of this Section 5.3, and shall provide for a base salary no
         less favorable than the base salary in effect on the Terminals Closing
         Date. Each Terminals Employee who remains employed by the Terminals
         Companies or becomes employed by a Purchaser Employer pursuant to this
         Section 5.3(a) shall be referred to herein as a "Terminals Continuing
         Employee." As soon as practicable, but prior to the Terminals Closing
         Date, Purchaser shall provide Seller with notice of those Terminals
         Employees to whom it has made an offer of continuing employment. As
         soon as practicable after the Terminals Closing Date, Purchaser shall
         furnish Seller with a list of all Terminals Employees who become
         Terminals Continuing Employees as of the Terminals Closing Date.
         Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Terminals Closing
         Date, Seller shall cause the Terminals Companies to transfer to one or
         more Affiliates of Seller or terminate the employment of any employee
         of the Terminals Companies on such preceding day who will not be a
         Terminals Continuing Employee immediately following the Terminals
         Closing, including those employees on long-term disability. Seller
         shall be solely responsible for any severance costs and all benefits or
         other liabilities associated with any employee of the Terminals
         Companies who does not become a Terminals Continuing Employee;
         provided, however, that Purchaser shall be responsible for payment of
         all severance obligations described in Section 5.3(h) and for the
         second installment of the stay bonus under the individual stay bonus
         agreements to the Terminals Continuing Employees who are eligible for
         such payments, the amount of such payments with respect to stay bonuses
         not to exceed $1,100,000. At the Terminals Closing, Seller shall
         provide Purchaser with a list of those Terminals Continuing Employees
         who are entitled to receive stay bonuses and the amount thereof.
         Purchaser shall be solely responsible for compliance with and any and
         all liabilities in connection with the Worker Adjustment Retraining and
         Notification Act ("WARN"). Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with
         each other in causing the appropriate entity to send WARN notices to
         affected employees prior to the Terminals Closing Date in order to
         limit the WARN notice period.

                  (b) Effective as of the Terminals Closing Date, the Terminals
         Companies shall cease to be participating employers in the GATX
         Non-Contributory Pension Plan




                                       42
<PAGE>   54

         for Salaried Employees, Non-Contributory Pension Plan of GATX (Hourly
         Employees) (collectively, the "Seller Pension Plans"), GATX Salaried
         Employees Retirement Savings Plan and GATX Hourly Employees Retirement
         Savings Plan (individually a "Seller Savings Plan" and, collectively,
         the "Seller Savings Plans") (all such pension and savings plans being
         referred to, collectively, as the "GATX Qualified Plans"), and as of
         such date all Terminals Continuing Employees shall cease to be eligible
         to participate in the GATX Qualified Plans. Any service or compensation
         earned by a Terminals Continuing Employee for any period after the
         Terminals Closing Date shall be disregarded for all purposes of the
         GATX Qualified Plans. To the extent allowed by applicable law, Seller
         shall cause all Terminals Continuing Employees to be fully vested in
         their accrued benefits under the GATX Qualified Plans as of the
         Terminals Closing Date. Purchaser shall have no obligation for any
         past, present or future accrued liabilities under the GATX Qualified
         Plans.

                  (c) Effective as of the Terminals Closing Date, Purchaser
         shall take all action necessary or appropriate (i) to extend coverage
         under one or more new or existing defined contribution plans (the
         "Purchaser Savings Plan") qualified under section 401(a) of the Code
         and meeting the requirements of section 401(k) of the Code to Terminals
         Continuing Employees who have account balances under a Seller Savings
         Plan as of the Terminals Closing Date and (ii) to permit such employees
         to roll over such account balances (including any outstanding plan
         loans) to the Purchaser Savings Plan as soon as practicable after the
         Terminals Closing Date to the extent that Seller determines that
         distribution of such balances from the Seller Savings Plans is
         permitted by applicable law. If Seller determines that such
         distribution is not permitted, the account balance of each Terminals
         Continuing Employee under a Seller Savings Plan shall be transferred
         (within the meaning of section 414(l) of the Code) to the Purchaser
         Savings Plan, as soon as practicable after the Terminals Closing Date,
         in a transfer conforming to the requirements of section 411(d)(6) of
         the Code, but only to the extent that such Terminals Continuing
         Employee elects such a transfer in accordance with procedures
         established by Seller.

                  (d) Effective as of the Terminals Closing Date, the Terminals
         Companies shall cease to be participating employers in the Terminals
         Companies Plans that are welfare benefit plans as described in Section
         3(1) of ERISA and that are not Terminals Subsidiary Plans (together
         with Calnev Plans that are welfare benefits plans and not Calnev
         Subsidiary Plans, the "Seller Welfare Benefit Plans"). Effective as of
         the Terminals Closing Date, Purchaser shall take all actions necessary
         or appropriate to extend coverage to Terminals Continuing Employees who
         are covered under the Seller Welfare Benefit Plans on the Terminals
         Closing Date (and their covered dependents) under one or more new or
         existing welfare benefit plans (the "Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans")
         providing medical, dental, prescription drug, vision, life insurance,
         accident insurance, flexible spending account, short-term and long-term
         disability benefits. Terminals Continuing Employees shall be eligible
         to participate in the Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans without regard to
         any eligibility period, waiting period, evidence of insurability
         requirements (except for evidence of insurability requirements
         applicable to Purchaser's supplemental life insurance plan) or
         pre-existing condition limitations and shall be given credit under the
         Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans for amounts paid under a




                                       43
<PAGE>   55

         corresponding Seller Welfare Benefit Plan or Terminals Subsidiary Plan
         during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles,
         co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been
         paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable
         Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan.

                  (e) Effective as of the Terminals Closing Date, the Terminals
         Companies shall cease to be participating employers in the GATX Excess
         Benefit Retirement Plan and the GATX Supplemental Retirement Plan
         (individually a "GATX Non-Qualified Plan" and, collectively, the "GATX
         Non-Qualified Plans"), and all Terminals Continuing Employees shall
         cease to be eligible to participate in the GATX Non-Qualified Plans.
         Any service or compensation earned by a Terminals Continuing Employee
         for any period after the Terminals Closing Date shall be disregarded
         for all purposes of the GATX Non-Qualified Plans. Purchaser shall have
         no obligation for any past, present or future accrued liabilities under
         the GATX Non-Qualified Plans.

                  (f) One or more of the Terminals Companies is a party to and
         bound by the terms of the collective bargaining agreements set forth in
         Schedule 2.17 ("Terminals Bargaining Agreements"). Purchaser agrees
         that, subject to the following provisions of this paragraph (f) or
         Purchaser's renegotiation of such Terminals Bargaining Agreements in
         writing prior to the Terminals Closing Date, Purchaser shall (or shall
         cause the Terminals Companies to) comply with and perform all
         obligations under the Terminals Bargaining Agreements for periods after
         the Terminals Closing Date during which the Terminals Bargaining
         Agreements remain in effect and comply with and perform all obligations
         that survive the expiration of the Terminals Bargaining Agreements
         under applicable law with respect to Terminals Continuing Employees who
         are covered by such agreements (the "Terminals Continuing Union
         Employees"), including without limitation obligations relating to
         wages, vacation, holiday and severance pay, insurance, post-retirement
         medical, life and pension benefits. Except as otherwise specifically
         provided below in this paragraph (f), Purchaser shall take all such
         actions (including, without limitation, the establishing of, or causing
         of, one or more Terminals Companies to establish such mirror plans) as
         may be necessary or appropriate to provide to Terminals Continuing
         Union Employees (and their eligible dependents) for periods after the
         Terminals Closing Date during which the Terminals Bargaining Agreements
         remain in effect the benefits set forth in the Terminals Bargaining
         Agreements, including any such benefits that survive the expiration of
         the Terminals Bargaining Agreements. For purposes of fulfilling the
         pension obligations under certain Terminals Bargaining Agreements, on
         or as soon as practicable after the Terminals Closing Date, Purchaser
         shall (or shall cause a Terminals Company to) extend coverage to
         Terminals Continuing Union Employees under a qualified defined benefit
         pension plan (the "Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan") which shall be
         identical in all material respects to the Non-Contributory Pension Plan
         of GATX (the "Seller Hourly Pension Plan") as in effect as of the
         Terminals Closing Date and shall credit the service and pay credited to
         each Terminals Continuing Union Employee under the Seller Hourly
         Pension Plan as of the Terminals Closing Date for all purposes under
         the Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan, including eligibility, vesting,
         benefit accrual and eligibility for subsidized benefits. The benefit
         (expressed as a single life annuity) payable from the Purchaser Hourly
         Pension Plan with respect to each Terminals Continuing Union Employee,
         determined as of the date as of






                                       44
<PAGE>   56

         which payment from the Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan actually
         commences, shall be reduced by the benefit (expressed as a single life
         annuity) payable with respect to such individual from the Seller Hourly
         Pension Plan, based on such Terminals Continuing Union Employee's
         accrued benefit under the Seller Hourly Pension Plan as of the
         Terminals Closing Date and determined as follows: (i) if the Terminals
         Continuing Union Employee is eligible to commence (or has commenced)
         payment from the Seller Hourly Pension Plan at the date that payment
         from the Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan commences, the benefit payable
         from the Seller Hourly Pension Plan shall be determined as if payment
         of the Terminals Continuing Union Employee's pension from the Seller
         Hourly Pension Plan commenced as of the same date that payment from the
         Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan commences (without regard to the date as
         of which payment from the Seller Hourly Pension Plan actually
         commences); and (ii) if the Terminals Continuing Union Employee is not
         eligible to commence payment from the Seller Hourly Pension Plan at the
         date that payment from the Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan commences, the
         benefit payable from Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan shall be reduced by
         the Terminals Continuing Union Employee's accrued benefit under the
         Seller Hourly Pension Plan as of the Terminals Closing Date,
         actuarially reduced from (A) age 65 if the employee has less than 15
         years of service under the Seller Hourly Pension Plan, and (B) age 62
         if the Terminals Continuing Union Employee has 15 or more years of
         service under the Seller Hourly Pension Plan. The actuarial reduction
         for this purpose shall reflect the actuarial basis for purposes of
         determining early commencement of benefits as set forth in the Seller
         Hourly Pension Plan as in effect on the Terminals Closing Date. In no
         event shall the benefit actually payable from the Seller Hourly Pension
         Plan with respect to a Terminals Continuing Union Employee be greater
         than the benefit to which such individual is entitled under the terms
         of the Seller Hourly Pension Plan as in effect on the Terminals Closing
         Date, determined as if the Terminals Continuing Union Employee
         terminated from the employ of the Terminals Companies and all its
         Affiliates on the Terminals Closing Date. In no event shall the benefit
         actually payable from the Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan with respect to
         a Terminals Continuing Union Employee be greater than (i) the benefit
         to which such individual would have been entitled under the Seller
         Hourly Pension Plan had such individual continued participation under
         the Seller Hourly Pension Plan after the Terminals Closing Date (under
         the terms of the Seller Hourly Pension plan in effect as of the
         Terminals Closing Date but determined as though the Seller Hourly
         Pension Plan were amended to take into account any pension changes
         negotiated by Purchaser after the Terminals Closing Date) until the
         date as of which such individual ceases accruing benefits under the
         Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan, less (ii) the amount by which the
         benefit under the Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan shall be reduced
         pursuant to this paragraph (f).

                  (g) For periods after the Terminals Closing Date, Purchaser
         shall ensure that (i) Terminals Continuing Employees who are not
         Terminals Continuing Union Employees (and their eligible dependents)
         shall participate in the employee benefit plans, policies, programs and
         arrangements maintained from time to time by Purchaser (collectively,
         the "Purchaser Plans") on terms and conditions which, subject to the
         following provisions of this paragraph (g), are substantially the same
         as applied to other similarly situated employees and former employees
         of Purchaser, (ii) Terminals Continuing Employees shall be given credit
         under the Purchaser Plans (other than plans




                                       45

         qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code) and the Purchaser Welfare
         Benefits Plans for their service with Seller and the Terminals
         Companies and their predecessors for all purposes (including
         eligibility for vacation, severance and post-retirement medical
         benefits) to the extent that such service is taken into account under
         the corresponding Terminals Companies Plan as of the Terminals Closing
         Date, (iii) Terminals Continuing Employees shall be given credit under
         the Purchaser Plans that are qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
         for their service with Seller and the Terminals Companies and their
         predecessors for purposes of eligibility and vesting.

                  (h) Purchaser shall provide severance and other benefits under
         the Enhanced GATX Severance Pay Program and under any severance
         arrangements listed on Schedule 2.13 (including Schedule 2.13(a)) to
         any Terminals Continuing Employee whose employment terminates during
         the 12-month period beginning on the Terminals Closing Date; provided,
         however, that to the extent that Purchaser is unable to provide certain
         benefits under such arrangements, Purchaser shall substitute the cash
         equivalent thereof.

                  (i) Purchaser shall pay and be responsible for the payment of
         all amounts which may be or become due to Terminals Continuing
         Employees under Purchaser's bonus plans for the calendar year in which
         the Terminals Closing Date occurs as if the Terminals Continuing
         Employees became covered by such plans as of January 1 of such year.
         The Terminals Closing Balance Sheet shall include an accrual for the
         amount of the bonus accrued by Terminals Continuing Employees under the
         Seller's bonus plans for the period from January 1 of the year in which
         the Terminals Closing Date occurs through the Terminals Closing Date.

                  (j) Purchaser shall be responsible for the vacation time
         accrued by Terminals Continuing Employees prior to the Terminals
         Closing Date. Purchaser shall recognize the vacation time accrued by
         Terminals Continuing Employees on Seller's payroll records as of the
         Terminals Closing Date. Purchaser shall not be required to make a cash
         payment to Terminals Continuing Employees for such accrued vacation
         time except for payments of accrued but unused vacation pay upon
         termination of a Terminals Continuing Employee's employment. Purchaser
         shall have no obligation for any vacation time accrued prior to the
         Terminals Closing Date by Terminals Employees who are not Terminals
         Continuing Employees.

                  (k) On or prior to the Terminals Closing Date, Seller shall,
         or shall cause the Terminals Companies to, take such action as may be
         necessary or appropriate to conform the Terminals Companies Plans to
         the provisions of this Section 5.3. Unless specifically permitted by
         the terms of this Agreement or as set forth on Schedule 4.3 hereto,
         from the date hereof until the Terminals Closing Date, to the extent
         that Terminals Continuing Employees would be affected, Seller shall not
         (i) increase the rate of compensation payable or to become payable to
         any Terminals Employee, (ii) enter into any new, or agree to any
         increase in the benefits to be provided under any existing, individual
         severance agreement, stay bonus agreement or employment agreement,
         (iii) amend any Terminals Companies Plan to increase any benefits or
         rights thereunder, or (iv) adopt any new plan, program, policy or
         arrangement which, if it existed as of the Terminals Closing Date,
         would constitute a Terminals Companies Plan.

                  (l) The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions
         contained in this Agreement with respect to employee benefit plans or
         employee compensation are included for the sole benefit of the
         respective parties hereto and shall not create any right in any other
         Person, including, without limitation, any employees of the Terminals
         Companies, any participant in any Terminals Companies Plans or any
         beneficiary thereof.

                  (m) The corresponding reserve on the balance sheet having been
         removed, Seller shall retain and discharge the workers compensation
         liability of Terminals arising out of workers compensation accidents
         occurring prior to the Terminals Closing Date.

         5.4 Full Access. From and after the Terminals Closing Date, Purchaser
shall cause the Terminals Companies to afford Seller and its counsel,
accountants and other authorized representatives, with two days' prior notice,
reasonable access during normal business hours to the respective premises,
properties, personnel, books and records of the Terminals Companies and any
other assets or information that Seller reasonably deems necessary to prepare
the Terminals Closing Balance Sheet and any report or Tax Return required to be
filed by Seller (but so as not to unduly disrupt the normal course of operations
of the Terminals Companies), including, without limitation, preparing or
defending any such Tax Return and any interim or annual report or other
accounting statements. Personnel of the Terminals Companies shall be available
to execute Tax statute of limitation waivers and amended Tax Returns at Seller's
request for the Tax Returns for the Tax Period prior to the Terminals Closing
Date. Personnel of the Terminals Companies shall assist Seller in the
preparation of the Terminals Closing Balance Sheet with respect to the Terminals
Companies and any Tax Returns which Seller is required to prepare pursuant to

to compensate such personnel, Purchaser or the Terminals Companies for such
assistance.

         5.5 HSR Filings. As promptly as practicable, Purchaser shall (in
cooperation with Seller) (i) make all filings and submissions with the DOJ and
the FTC under the HSR Act and any applicable state or foreign laws or
regulations as may be reasonably required to be made with Governmental
Authorities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
requesting early any termination of the waiting period thereunder, (ii) respond
promptly to any inquiries from the DOJ, the FTC or other Governmental
Authorities in connection with such filings and (iii) comply in all material
respects with the requirements of the HSR Act. Subject to regulatory
constraints, Seller and Purchaser shall each keep the other party fully advised
with respect to any requests from or communications with the DOJ, FTC or other
Governmental Authority and shall consult with the other party with respect to
all filings and responses thereto.

         5.6 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification. For a period of six years

Terminals Company to the past and current officers and directors of such
Terminals Company.

         5.7 Use of GATX Name. As promptly as reasonably practicable subsequent
to the Terminals Closing, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each of the Terminals Companies to cease using the GATX name or any
derivative thereof in any way. Without limiting the foregoing, as promptly as
reasonably practicable subsequent to the Terminals Closing, Purchaser shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Terminals Companies to (a) change the
name of any Terminals Company that includes "GATX" and (b) remove the GATX name,
any derivative thereof and any logo related thereto from any tanks, trucks or
other objects on which such name appears. Notwithstanding the foregoing, within

Other Services. Subsequent to the Terminals Closing and for so long as Seller or
any of its Affiliates has any beneficial ownership interest in Terminal de
Productos Especializados S.A. de C.V. ("TPE"), Purchaser shall cause the
Terminals Companies to provide certain services to TPE. Details regarding such
services, and the rates to be paid by TPE for such services shall be as set
forth in the Services Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B. Representatives of
each of Purchaser and Seller shall meet on a monthly basis to review the extent
and adequacy of such services. The Services Agreement shall also provide the
terms and conditions pursuant to which Purchaser shall cause the Terminals
Companies to provide certain services to Seller subsequent to the Terminals
Closing.

         5.10 License Agreement with KTSB. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Terminals from, prior to
Terminals Closing, executing a License Agreement with Kertih Terminals SBN BHD
relating to its GALAHAD software on substantially the same terms as have
previously been disclosed to Purchaser. In the event that Terminals does not
execute such License Agreement prior to Terminals Closing, Purchaser shall cause
Terminals to execute such License Agreement subsequent to Terminals Closing so
long as the terms thereof are substantially similar to the terms that have
previously been disclosed to Purchaser.

         5.11 Agreement with Nippon GATX Company Limited. Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Terminals
from, prior to the Terminals Closing, transferring the Services Agreement
between Terminals and Nippon GATX Company Limited ("Nippon") to Rail or an

                                   ARTICLE 5A
           COVENANTS OF PURCHASER WITH RESPECT TO THE CALNEV COMPANIES

         Purchaser hereby covenants to and agrees with Seller as follows:

         5A.1 Corporate and Other Actions. Prior to the Calnev Closing Date,
Purchaser shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement related to the Calnev Sale or New Calnev Sale
(as applicable) and to consummate the Calnev Sale and the transactions
contemplated thereby.

         5A.2 Confidentiality. Purchaser agrees to deliver to Seller a duly
executed amendment to the Confidentiality Agreement providing that the term of
the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to the Calnev Companies shall not
expire until the Calnev Closing Date.

         5A.3 Calnev Employees and Benefit Plans.

                  (a) Purchaser shall be entitled to determine, in its sole
         discretion, the employee staffing that will be required for the Calnev
         Companies after the Calnev Closing and shall make offers of continuing
         employment with the Calnev Companies or a Purchaser Employer or its
         general partner or Purchaser's other Affiliates or their general
         partners, effective on the Calnev Closing Date, to any or all Calnev
         Employees in its discretion; provided, however, that Purchaser shall
         make offers of continuing employment to at least 68 Calnev Employees.
         As used herein, "Calnev Employees" means the employees of the Calnev
         Companies as of the date hereof who will be full-time, active or
         regular part-time employees on the Calnev Closing Date, including those
         on temporary leave for jury duty, family or short-term medical leave or
         vacation. Schedule 5.3(a) lists the Calnev Employees and sets forth,
         for each of the Calnev Employees, his or her job title and, to the
         extent available, his or her current annual rate of
         base wages or base salary. Any such offers of continuing employment
         shall be made as soon as practicable prior to the Calnev Closing Date
         and shall specify the terms of such employment, which terms shall be in
         accordance with the following provisions of this Section 5A.3, and
         shall provide for a base salary no less favorable than the
         base salary in effect on the Calnev Closing Date. Each Calnev Employee
         who remains employed by any of the Calnev Companies or becomes employed
         by a Purchaser


                                       49
<PAGE>   61

         Employer pursuant to this Section 5A.3(a) shall be referred to herein
         as a "Calnev Continuing Employee." As soon as practicable but prior to
         the Calnev Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide Seller with notice of
         those Calnev Employees to whom it has made an offer of continuing
         employment. As soon as practicable after the Calnev Closing Date,
         Purchaser shall furnish Seller with a list of all Calnev Employees who
         become Calnev Continuing Employees as of the Calnev Closing Date.
         Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Calnev Closing Date,
         Seller shall cause the Calnev Companies to transfer to one or more
         Affiliates of Seller or terminate the employment of any employee of the
         Calnev Companies on such preceding day who will not be a Calnev
         Continuing Employee immediately following the Calnev Closing, including
         those employees on long-term disability. Seller shall be solely
         responsible for any severance costs and all benefits or other
         liabilities associated with any employee of the Calnev Companies who
         does not become a Calnev Continuing Employee; provided, however, that
         Purchaser shall be responsible for payment of all severance obligations
         described in Section 5A.3(h) and for the second installment of the stay
         bonus under the individual stay bonus agreements to the Calnev
         Continuing Employees who are eligible for such payments, the amount of
         such payments with respect to stay bonuses not to exceed $1,100,000
         less the aggregate amount of stay bonuses paid or to be paid to
         Terminals Continuing Employees pursuant to Section 5.3(a). At the
         Calnev Closing, Seller shall provide Purchaser with a list of those
         Calnev Continuing Employees who are entitled to receive stay bonuses
         and the amount thereof. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for
         compliance with and any and all liabilities in connection with WARN.
         Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other in causing the
         appropriate entity to send WARN notices to employees prior to the
         Calnev Closing Date in order to limit the WARN notice period.

                  (b) Effective as of the Calnev Closing Date, each Calnev
         Company shall cease to be participating employers in the GATX Qualified
         Plans, and as of such date all Calnev Continuing Employees shall cease
         to be eligible to participate in the GATX Qualified Plans. Any service
         or compensation earned by a Calnev Continuing Employee for any period
         after the Calnev Closing Date shall be disregarded for all purposes of
         the GATX Qualified Plans. To the extent allowed by applicable law,
         Seller shall cause all Calnev Continuing Employees to be fully vested
         in their accrued benefits under the GATX Qualified Plans as of the
         Calnev Closing Date. Purchaser shall have no obligation for any past,
         present or future accrued liabilities under the GATX Qualified Plans.

                  (c) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall take all
         action necessary or appropriate (i) to extend coverage under the
         Purchaser Savings Plan to Calnev Continuing Employees who have account
         balances under a Seller Savings Plan as of the Calnev Closing Date and
         (ii) to permit such employees to roll over such account balances
         (including any outstanding plan loans) to the Purchaser Savings Plan as
         soon as practicable after the Calnev Closing Date to the extent that
         Seller determines that distribution of such balances from the Seller
         Savings Plans is permitted by applicable law. If Seller determines that
         such distribution is not permitted, the account balance of each Calnev
         Continuing Employee under a Seller Savings Plan shall be transferred
         (within the meaning of section 414(l) of the Code) to the Purchaser
         Savings Plan, as soon as practicable after the Calnev Closing Date, in
         a transfer conforming to the requirements


                                       50
<PAGE>   62

         of section 411(d)(6) of the Code, but only to the extent that such
         Calnev Continuing Employee elects such a transfer in accordance with
         procedures established by Seller.

                  (d) Effective as of the Calnev Closing Date, each Calnev
         Company shall cease to be participating employers in the Seller Welfare
         Benefit Plans that are not Calnev Subsidiary Plans. Effective as of the
         Calnev Closing Date, Purchaser shall take all actions necessary or
         appropriate to extend coverage to Calnev Continuing Employees who are
         covered under the Seller Welfare Benefit Plans on the Calnev Closing
         Date (and their covered dependents) under one or more Purchaser Welfare
         Benefit Plans providing medical, dental, prescription drug, vision,
         life insurance, accident insurance, flexible spending account,
         short-term and long-term disability benefits. Calnev Continuing
         Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Purchaser Welfare
         Benefit Plans without regard to any eligibility period, waiting period,
         evidence of insurability requirements (except for evidence of
         insurability requirements applicable to Purchaser's supplemental life
         insurance plan) or pre-existing condition limitations and shall be
         given credit under the Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans for amounts paid
         under a corresponding Seller Welfare Benefit Plan or Calnev Subsidiary
         Plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles,
         co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been
         paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable
         Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan.

                  (e) Effective as of the Calnev Closing Date, each Calnev
         Company shall cease to be participating employers in the GATX
         Non-Qualified Plans, and all Calnev Continuing Employees shall cease to
         be eligible to participate in the GATX Non-Qualified Plans. Any service
         or compensation earned by a Calnev Continuing Employee for any period
         after the Calnev Closing Date shall be disregarded for all purposes of
         the GATX Non-Qualified Plans. Purchaser shall have no obligation for
         any past, present or future accrued liabilities under the GATX
         Non-Qualified Plans.

                  (f) No Calnev Company is currently a party to or bound by the
         terms of any collective bargaining agreement ("Calnev Bargaining
         Agreements"). Purchaser agrees that, subject to the following
         provisions of this paragraph (f) or Purchaser's renegotiation of such
         Calnev Bargaining Agreements in writing prior to the Calnev Closing
         Date and only to the extent any Calnev Company shall become a party to
         or become bound by the terms of a Calnev Collective Bargaining
         Agreement prior to the Calnev Closing Date, Purchaser shall (or shall
         cause Calnev to) comply with and perform all obligations under the
         Calnev Bargaining Agreements for periods after the Calnev Closing Date
         during which the Calnev Bargaining Agreements remain in effect and
         comply with and perform all obligations that survive the expiration of
         the Calnev Bargaining Agreement under applicable law with respect to
         Calnev Continuing Employees who are covered by such agreements (the
         "Calnev Continuing Union Employees"), including without limitation
         obligations relating to wages, vacation, holiday and severance pay,
         insurance, post-retirement medical, life and pension benefits. Except
         as otherwise specifically provided below in this paragraph (f),
         Purchaser shall take all such actions (including, without limitation,
         the establishing of, or causing of, the Calnev Companies to establish,
         such mirror plans) as may be necessary or appropriate to provide to
         Calnev Continuing Union Employees (and their eligible dependents), if
         any, for periods after the Calnev Closing



                                       51
<PAGE>   63

         Date during which the Calnev Bargaining Agreements remain in effect the
         benefits set forth in the Calnev Bargaining Agreements, including any
         such benefits that survive the expiration of the Calnev Bargaining
         Agreements. For purposes of fulfilling the pension obligations under
         Calnev Bargaining Agreements, if any, on or as soon as practicable
         after the Calnev Closing Date, Purchaser shall (or shall cause the
         Calnev Companies to) extend coverage to Calnev Continuing Union
         Employees under the Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan which shall be
         identical in all material respects to the Seller Hourly Pension Plan as
         in effect as of the Calnev Closing Date and shall credit the service
         and pay credited to each Calnev Continuing Union Employee under the
         Seller Hourly Pension Plan as of the Calnev Closing Date for all
         purposes under the Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan, including
         eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility for subsidized
         benefits. The benefit (expressed as a single life annuity) payable from
         the Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan with respect to each Calnev
         Continuing Union Employee, determined as of the date as of which
         payment from the Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan actually commences,
         shall be reduced by the benefit (expressed as a single life annuity)
         payable with respect to such individual from the Seller Hourly Pension
         Plan, based on such Calnev Continuing Union Employee's accrued benefit
         under the Seller Hourly Pension Plan as of the Calnev Closing Date and
         determined as follows: (i) if the Calnev Continuing Union Employee is
         eligible to commence (or has commenced) payment from the Seller Hourly
         Pension Plan at the date that payment from the Purchaser Hourly Pension
         Plan commences, the benefit payable from the Seller Hourly Pension Plan
         shall be determined as if payment of the Calnev Continuing Union
         Employee's pension from the Seller Hourly Pension Plan commenced as of
         the same date that payment from the Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan
         commences (without regard to the date as of which payment from the
         Seller Hourly Pension Plan actually commences); and (ii) if the Calnev
         Continuing Union Employee is not eligible to commence payment from the
         Seller Hourly Pension Plan at the date that payment from the Purchaser
         Hourly Pension Plan commences, the benefit payable from Purchaser
         Hourly Pension Plan shall be reduced by the Calnev Continuing Union
         Employee's accrued benefit under the Seller Hourly Pension Plan as of
         the Calnev Closing Date, actuarially reduced from (A) age 65 if the
         employee has less than 15 years of service under the Seller Hourly
         Pension Plan, and (B) age 62 if the Calnev Continuing Union Employee
         has 15 or more years of service under the Seller Hourly Pension Plan.
         The actuarial reduction for this purpose shall reflect the actuarial
         basis for purposes of determining early commencement of benefits as set
         forth in the Seller Hourly Pension Plan as in effect on the Calnev
         Closing Date. In no event shall the benefit actually payable from the
         Seller Hourly Pension Plan with respect to a Calnev Continuing Union
         Employee be greater than the benefit to which such individual is
         entitled under the terms of the Seller Hourly Pension Plan as in effect
         on the Calnev Closing Date, determined as if the Calnev Continuing
         Union Employee terminated from the employ of Calnev and all its
         Affiliates on the Calnev Closing Date. In no event shall the benefit
         actually payable from the Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan with respect to
         a Calnev Continuing Union Employee be greater than (i) the benefit to
         which such individual would have been entitled under the Seller Hourly
         Pension Plan had such individual continued participation under the
         Seller Hourly Pension Plan after the Calnev Closing Date (under the
         terms of the Seller Hourly Pension plan in effect as of the Calnev
         Closing Date but determined as though the Seller Hourly Pension Plan
         were amended to




                                       52

         the amount by which the benefit under the Purchaser Hourly Pension Plan
         shall be reduced pursuant to this paragraph (f).

         ensure that (i) Calnev Continuing Employees who are not Calnev
         Continuing Union Employees (and their eligible dependents) shall
         participate in the Purchaser Plans on terms and conditions which,
         subject to the following provisions of this paragraph (g), are
         substantially the same as applied to other similarly situated employees
         and former employees of Purchaser, (ii) Calnev Continuing Employees

         qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code) and the Purchaser Welfare
         Benefits Plans for their service with Seller and the Calnev Companies
         and their predecessors for all purposes (including eligibility for

         Plan as of the Calnev Closing Date, (iii) Calnev Continuing Employees
         shall be given credit under the Purchaser Plans that are qualified
         under Section 401(a) of the Code for their service with Seller and
         Calnev and their predecessors for purposes of eligibility and vesting.

                  (h) Purchaser shall provide severance and other benefits under
         the Enhanced GATX Severance Pay Program and under any severance
         arrangements listed on Schedule 2.13 (including Schedule 2.13(a)) to
         any Calnev Continuing Employee whose employment terminates during the
         12-month period beginning on the Calnev Closing Date; provided,

         benefits under such arrangements, Purchaser shall substitute the cash
         equivalent thereof.

                  (i) Purchaser shall pay and be responsible for the payment of

         Closing Date occurs as if the Calnev Continuing Employees became
         covered by such plans as of January 1 of such year. The Calnev Closing
         Balance Sheet shall include an accrual for the amount of the bonus
         accrued by Calnev Continuing Employees under the Seller's bonus plans
         for the period from January 1 of the year in which the Calnev Closing

         Calnev Continuing Employees for such accrued vacation time except for
         payments of accrued but unused vacation pay upon termination of a
         Calnev Continuing Employee's employment. Purchaser shall have no
         obligation for any vacation time accrued prior to the Calnev Closing
         Date by Calnev Employees who are not Calnev Continuing Employees.

                  (k) On or prior to the Calnev Closing Date, Seller shall, or
         shall cause the Calnev Companies to, take such action as may be
         necessary or appropriate to conform the Calnev Plans to the provisions
         of this Section 5A.3. Unless specifically permitted by the terms of
         this Agreement or as set forth on Schedule 4.3 hereto, from the date
         hereof until the Calnev Closing Date, to the extent that Calnev
         Continuing Employees would be affected, Seller shall not (i) increase
         the rate of compensation payable or to become payable to any Calnev
         Employee, (ii) enter into any new, or agree to any increase in the
         benefits to be provided under any existing, individual severance
         agreement, stay bonus agreement or employment agreement, (iii) amend
         any Calnev Plan to increase any benefits or rights thereunder, or (iv)
         adopt any new plan, program, policy or arrangement which, if it existed
         as of the Calnev Closing Date, would constitute a Calnev Plan.

                  (l) The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions
         contained in this Agreement with respect to employee benefit plans or
         employee compensation are included for the sole benefit of the
         respective parties hereto and shall not create any right in any other
         Person, including, without limitation, any employee of the Calnev
         Companies, any participant in any Calnev Plans or any beneficiary
         thereof.

                  (m) The corresponding reserve on the balance sheet having been
         removed, Seller shall retain and discharge the workers compensation
         liability of the Calnev Companies arising out of workers compensation
         accidents occurring prior to the Calnev Closing Date.

         5A.4 Full Access. From and after the Calnev Closing Date, Purchaser
shall cause Calnev to afford Seller and its counsel, accountants and other
authorized representatives, with two days' prior notice, reasonable access
during normal business hours to the respective premises, properties, personnel,
books and records of the Calnev Companies and any other assets or information
that Seller reasonably deems necessary to prepare the Calnev Closing Balance
Sheet with respect to Calnev and any report or Tax Return required to be filed
by Seller (but so as not to unduly disrupt the normal course of operations of
the Calnev Companies), including, without limitation, preparing or defending any
such Tax Return and any interim or annual report or other accounting statements.
Personnel of the Calnev Companies shall be available to execute Tax statute of
limitation waivers and amended Tax Returns at Seller's request for the Tax
Returns for the Tax Period prior to the Calnev Closing Date. Personnel of the
Calnev Companies shall assist Seller in the preparation of the Calnev Closing
Balance Sheet with respect to the Calnev Companies and any Tax Returns which
Seller is required to prepare pursuant to Sections 10A.2(a) and 10A.2(b);
provided, however, that Seller shall not be obligated to compensate such
personnel, Purchaser or the Calnev Companies for such assistance.

         5A.5 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification. For a period of six
years from the Calnev Closing Date, Purchaser agrees not to amend the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Calnev in any way to reduce or
eliminate the level of indemnification provided by any of the Calnev Companies
to the past and current officers and directors of such Calnev Company.

         5A.6 Use of GATX Name. As promptly as reasonably practicable subsequent
to the Calnev Closing, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each of the Calnev Companies to cease using the GATX name or any derivative
thereof in any way. Without

limiting the foregoing, as promptly as reasonably practicable subsequent to the
Calnev Closing, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Calnev Companies to (a) change the name of any Calnev Company that includes
"GATX" and (b) to remove the GATX name, any derivative thereof and any logo
related thereto from any tanks, trucks or other objects on which such name
appears. Notwithstanding the foregoing, within three months of the Calnev
Closing, no Calnev Company shall use the GATX name or any derivative thereof in
any way.

         5A.7 HSR Filing With Respect to the Calnev Companies. In the event that
the Calnev Closing has not been consummated prior to December 1, 2001, as
promptly as practicable, Purchaser shall (in cooperation with Seller) (i) make
all filings and submissions with the DOJ and the FTC under the HSR Act and any
applicable state or foreign laws or regulations as may be reasonably required to
be made with all other Governmental Authorities in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, requesting early termination of any
waiting period thereunder, (ii) respond promptly to any inquiries from the DOJ,
the FTC or other Governmental Authorities in connection with such filings and
(iii) comply in all material respects with the HSR Act. Subject to regulatory
constraints, Seller and Purchaser shall keep the other party fully advised with
respect to any requests from or communications with the DOJ, FTC or other
Governmental Authority and shall consult with the other party with respect to
all filings and responses thereto.

         5A.8 Assumption of Obligations. Effective as of the Calnev Closing,
Purchaser shall assume the guarantees and other obligations of Seller set forth
on Schedule 5.8 with respect to the Calnev Companies and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause Seller to be fully released and discharged from
such obligations.

Terminals Sale:


                  (a) upon the mutual agreement of Seller and Purchaser;

                  (b) upon written notice from Purchaser to Seller if each of
         the conditions precedent set forth in Article 6 has not been satisfied
         on or before April 2, 2001; provided, however, if the consent of the
         Port of Tampa to the assignment of any of the leases specified as a
         condition to the Terminals Closing in Section 6.4(b) has not been
         obtained by April 2, 2001, Seller may, upon notice to Purchaser given
         no later than three business days prior to April 2, 2001, elect to
         extend the date in this clause (b) to May 31, 2001; or

                  (c) upon written notice from Seller to Purchaser if each of
         the conditions precedent set forth in Article 7 has not been satisfied
         on or before April 2, 2001.

         If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 8.4, all
further obligations of the parties under this Agreement will terminate, except
that (i) the obligations in Section 11.1 will survive and (ii) if this Agreement
with respect to Terminals Sale is terminated by a party because of the breach of
the Agreement by the other party or because one or more of the conditions to the
terminating party's obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a
result of the other party's failure to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement, the terminating party's right to pursue all legal remedies will
survive such termination unimpaired. The obligations of the parties under the
Confidentiality Agreement (as amended) shall survive, and continue in full force
and effect after termination of this Agreement with respect to Terminals Sale.

conditions to the terminating party's obligations under this Agreement with
respect to the Calnev Sale is not satisfied as a result of the other party's
failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement with respect to the
Calnev Sale, the terminating party's right to pursue all legal remedies will
survive such termination unimpaired. The obligations of the parties under the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive, and continue in full force and effect
after termination of this Agreement with respect to the Calnev Sale.

         8A.5 Asset Division. The parties agree to consummate the Calnev Sale
upon receipt of all requisite regulatory approvals for the Calnev Sale. In
addition, to preserve the possibility of an alternative transaction in the event
that CalPUC does not approve the Calnev Sale (or delays such approval), the
parties shall undertake all actions necessary to divide the assets and
liabilities of the Calnev Companies, to execute the operating agreement
regarding certain Calnev assets and to consummate the New Calnev Sale
(collectively, the "Asset Division") in the event the application before the
CalPUC for the approval of the Calnev Sale has not been placed on the CalPUC's
agenda for its March 27, 2001 meeting or in the event the CalPUC does not
approve the Calnev Sale at its March 27, 2001 meeting. The parties shall proceed
as promptly as is reasonably practicable to complete the Asset Division so as to
achieve the following objectives:

                  (a) Any and all assets of the Calnev Companies that may be
         transferred without the necessity of obtaining the approval of the
         CalPUC and all associated liabilities (the "Transferable Assets and
         Liabilities") shall be transferred by the Calnev Companies to a special
         purpose subsidiary to be formed by Seller ("New Calnev").



                                       62
<PAGE>   74

                  (b) Any and all assets and liabilities of the Calnev Companies
         other than the Transferable Assets and Liabilities (the "Retained
         Assets and Liabilities") shall be retained by the Calnev Companies.

                  (c) Seller and Purchaser (or the appropriate wholly-owned
         Affiliates thereof) shall execute a mutually agreeable operating
         agreement (the "Operating Agreement") that will govern the operation by
         Purchaser (or, subject to the reasonable approval of Seller, its
         designee) of the Retained Assets and Liabilities, designed so as to
         minimize any interference in the normal business operations of the
         Calnev Companies as constituted prior to such Asset Division and to
         observe applicable Law. The Asset Division, the New Calnev Sale and the
         Operating Agreement shall be subject to the overall mandate that the
         Operating Agreement and the other documents pertaining to the New
         Calnev Sale and the Asset Division shall contain commercially
         reasonable terms and conditions including, without limitation, that:

                           (i) the Purchaser (or, subject to the reasonable
                  approval of Seller, its designee) shall act as operator (the
                  "Operator") of the Retained Assets and Liabilities in
                  accordance with the Operating Agreement;

                           (ii) the execution, delivery and performance of the
                  Operating Agreement, the Asset Division and the New Calnev
                  Sale shall not violate any Law or require the consent or
                  approval of any Governmental Authority;

                           (iii) all revenues derived from the operation of the
                  Retained Assets and Liabilities shall be collected by the
                  Operator and held for the benefit of Calnev in a separately
                  identifiable operating account;

                           (iv) the Operator shall pay from such account: (A)
                  all costs associated with the Retained Assets and Liabilities,
                  including general and administrative expenses and other
                  overhead costs associated with the Retained Assets and
                  Liabilities; (B) an appropriate percentage of general overhead
                  and expenses incurred in the joint operation of the Calnev
                  Companies and New Calnev which cannot be allocated to
                  Transferable Assets and Liabilities or to Retained Assets and
                  Liabilities; and (C) as its sole and exclusive compensation
                  under the Operating Agreement, an amount of compensation that
                  is mutually agreeable to the parties (or, if the parties
                  cannot so agree, as is determined by the arbitration panel
                  contemplated by Section 8A.6);

                           (v) the Operator shall remit to Calnev the remainder
                  of the funds in the account on a monthly basis;

                           (vi) the Operator shall assume all operating risks
                  associated with the operation of the Retained Assets and
                  Liabilities;

                           (vii) the Operator shall indemnify Seller, and
                  release Seller from, all Losses associated with the operation
                  of the Retained Assets and Liabilities except for those solely
                  attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
                  Seller;



                                       63
<PAGE>   75

                           (viii) Seller shall have exclusive responsibility to
                  determine intrastate tariff changes and capital expenditures;

                           (ix) the Operator may be terminated by Seller for
                  reasonable cause and upon reasonable notice;

                           (x) the consummation of the Asset Division, the
                  Operating Agreement and the New Calnev Sale shall be subject
                  to the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in
                  Article 6A and Article 7A hereof; and

                           (xi) the consummation of the Asset Division, the
                  Operating Agreement and the New Calnev Sale shall be subject
                  to customary representations, warranties and covenants as may
                  be mutually agreeable to each of Purchaser and Seller.

If the Asset Division occurs, the parties will, unless and until they mutually
agree to the contrary or until the receipt of a final non-appealable order
denying approval of the transfer of the Retained Assets and Liabilities,
exercise reasonable best efforts to cause the CalPUC to approve the transfer of
the Retained Assets and Liabilities to Purchaser.

                  (d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 8A.5
         and the expiration or waiver of all required notice and waiting periods
         under the HSR Act and any other applicable competition laws, Seller
         shall sell, assign and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
         purchase and take assignment and delivery of, all of the issued and
         outstanding shares of capital stock of New Calnev, such capital stock
         having been converted into a limited liability company membership
         interest prior to any such sale (the "New Calnev Sale"). At the New
         Calnev Closing, Purchaser shall pay, by wire transfer of same-day
         funds, an amount equal to the Calnev Purchase Price (as adjusted to
         account for the difference in the Calnev Working Capital and Calnev
         Aggregate Non-Current Balance Sheet Liability between September 30,
         2000 and the New Calnev Closing Date pursuant to the mechanics set
         forth in Section 1A.3 hereof) multiplied by a fraction equal to the
         difference between (i) one (1) and (ii) a fraction having a numerator
         equal to the average revenue attributable to the Retained Assets and
         Liabilities in 1999 and 2000 (prior to the Asset Division) and a
         denominator equal to the average total revenue of the Calnev Companies
         in 1999 and 2000 (prior to the Asset Division), in each case as
         determined from the books and records of the Calnev Companies and the
         filings made by the Calnev Companies with the CalPUC and with the
         Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "New Calnev Purchase Price").

         8A.6 Actions Taken Contemporaneously with Asset Division.
Contemporaneously with the commencement of negotiations with respect to the
Asset Division pursuant to Section 8A.5, the parties shall undertake the
following:

                  (a) As promptly as possible after the commencement of the
         negotiations contemplated by Section 8A.5, the parties shall provide
         written notice to the CalPUC of their intention to consummate the Asset
         Division. Such notice shall state that the parties intend to pursue the
         CalPUC's approval of the intrastate portion of the transaction which is
         subject to the jurisdiction of the CalPUC, but proceed to close on the
         interstate portion



                                       64
<PAGE>   76

         and enter into an operating agreement whereby the Purchaser (or its
         designee) shall operate the intrastate assets on behalf of Calnev.

                  (b) On or before the fifth day following the commencement of
         the negotiations contemplated by Section 8A.5 and Section 8A.6, and in
         anticipation of the arbitration of potential disputes between them
         before a three member panel, the parties shall take such steps as may
         be required to initiate arbitration proceedings before the American
         Arbitration Association (the "AAA"). The parties shall request the AAA
         to tender separate lists of potential arbitrators having the following
         qualifications:

                           (i) One list shall be comprised of attorneys licensed
                  to practice law in the State of California with ten (10) or
                  more years of experience in practicing before the CalPUC; and

                           (ii) The other list shall be comprised of former
                  Justices of the California Supreme Court.

                  (c) The parties shall select three arbitrators from the lists
         so tendered, in the manner and within the time frame specified by
         applicable rules of the AAA. Two of the arbitrators shall have the
         qualifications specified in Section 8A.6(b)(i) and the remaining
         arbitrator shall have the qualifications specified in Section
         8A.6(b)(ii). In the event a former Justice of the California Supreme
         Court is not available, the AAA shall instruct the two arbitrators so
         selected to select a third arbitrator having the qualifications set
         forth in Section 8A.6(b)(i) above.

                  (d) Within thirty days following the receipt by each of the
         parties of the AAA's designation of the panel so selected, the panel
         shall develop and provide to the parties instructions as to the
         arbitral procedure, including the timeframe within which the parties
         must (i) provide a submission of issues to the panel, (ii) provide
         supporting documentation and memoranda of law, (iii) reply to the
         documentation and memoranda submitted by the other party and (iv) take
         such other action as the panel may deem necessary or advisable so that
         the resolution of the issues submitted may be resolved as promptly as
         possible, but in any event as close to July 1, 2001 as is reasonably
         practicable.

                  (e) No sooner than thirty (30) days after the commencement of
         negotiations pursuant to Section 8A.5 as mutually agreed by the
         parties, either party may ask the arbitration panel to resolve any
         points of disagreement between the parties relating to the Asset
         Division, Operating Agreement and New Calnev Sale. An arbitration
         proceeding conducted in accordance with this section, including the
         time table set forth herein shall be the exclusive remedy available to
         either party with respect to the Asset Division and for the failure of
         the other party to reach an agreement relating to the Asset Division,
         the Operating Agreement or the New Calnev Sale (other than for breach
         of the obligations under Section 8A.5 and Section 8A.6). The
         arbitration shall take place in Denver, Colorado, shall be governed by
         the choice of law set forth in Section 11.7 hereof, and, unless the
         parties otherwise agree, shall be governed by the commercial
         arbitration rules of the AAA. The panel shall resolve any issue
         submitted to it on the basis of (i)



                                       65
<PAGE>   77

         preserving the division between Transferable Assets and Liabilities and
         Retained Assets and Liabilities set forth in Section 8A.5(a) and (b),
         on terms not inconsistent with Section 8A.5(c), (ii) operational
         safety, (iii) operational efficiency and (iv) any other factors
         relevant to the achievement of the objectives set forth in this Section
         8A.5. The decision of the arbitration panel shall be final and binding
         on Seller and Purchaser, and the Asset Division, the Operating
         Agreement and the New Calnev Sale shall be conformed to reflect the
         decision of the arbitration panel. The parties shall exercise
         commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Asset Division as
         soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of the decision of the
         arbitration panel. If the arbitration panel is unable to resolve one or
         more of the disputes, the parties will continue to negotiate in good
         faith (but in any event not beyond December 31, 2001) toward a mutually
         agreeable resolution, reserving the right to ask the arbitration panel
         to resolve future disputes. The arbitration panel shall be directed to
         expressly confirm that the arbitration panel's proposed resolution of
         the issues submitted to arbitration by the parties does not violate
         applicable Law and does not require the approval of any Governmental
         Authority. All costs of the arbitration contemplated by this Section
         8A.5(e) shall be shared equally by Purchaser and Seller.

                  (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
         contrary, upon the first to occur of the following: (i) the mutual
         agreement of the parties, and (ii) the failure of the Asset Division to
         occur on or before December 31, 2001, and if the Calnev Sale has not
         occurred by December 31, 2001, the Seller and the Purchaser shall cease
         efforts to consummate the Asset Division and shall have no further
         rights as to each other with respect to the Calnev Companies, this
         Agreement shall terminate with respect to the Calnev Sale pursuant to
         Section 8A.4, the Asset Division, the Operating Agreement and the New
         Calnev Sale and the Seller shall be free to divest the Calnev Companies
         (by way of sale of equity, sale of assets, merger, joint venture,
         partnership, sale-leaseback, lease finance, synthetic lease or
         otherwise) to any bona fide third party that is not an Affiliate of
         Seller at its discretion, provided, however, that (x) if Seller divests
         the Calnev Companies for gross proceeds (including any debt and
         non-cash consideration) in excess of $375,000,000, Seller shall pay to
         Purchaser within five business days of the consummation of such
         divestiture an amount equal to the sum of 25% of the amount by which
         the gross proceeds (including any debt and non-cash consideration) from
         the divestiture exceed $375,000,000 (except that no such payment shall
         be due if the reason the transaction between Seller and Purchaser with
         respect to the Calnev Companies did not close before December 31, 2001
         was on account of a breach by Purchaser of its obligations under this
         Agreement) and (y) the terms of Section 8A.5(f)(ii)(x) and Section
         8A.6(b) shall survive. Nothing in this Section 8A.5(f) shall be
         construed so as to prevent Seller from transferring any Calnev Company
         to any of its wholly-owned Affiliates; provided, however, that upon any
         divestiture by such Affiliate to any bona fide third party that is not
         an Affiliate of Seller, Purchaser shall be entitled to the payments
         required in the second sentence of this Section 8A.5(f). If a third
         party that is not an Affiliate of Seller or Purchaser objects to the
         Asset Division, Operating Agreement or the New Calnev Sale on the
         ground that it would violate applicable Law and Purchaser nevertheless
         elects to consummate the Asset Division, the Operating Agreement and
         the New Calnev Sale, and the issue raised by the third party has not
         been addressed by an arbitration panel pursuant to this Section 8A.6,
         Purchaser agrees to indemnify Seller, to




                                       66
<PAGE>   78

         the maximum extent permitted by Law, for any Calnev Losses incurred by
         a Seller Indemnified Party resulting from such objection.

         8A.7 Special Severance Payment.

                  (a) Upon the earlier of the Calnev Closing and the date of the

         any contamination that was required to be disclosed by Seller pursuant
         to Section 2.18 but was not so disclosed.

         9.4  Schedule 9.2(a) Matters.

              (a) The parties acknowledge and agree that as of the Terminals
         Closing Date Seller shall retain full and total responsibility for and
         control of the Schedule 9.2(a) Matters. After the Terminals Closing
         Date, Seller will have no claim against Purchaser or any Terminals
         Purchaser Indemnified Party for any Loss which Seller may incur due to
         any of the Schedule 9.2(a) Matters; provided, however, that (i) Seller
         may recover from Purchaser for actual court costs and reasonable
         attorneys' fees incurred to compel the reasonable cooperation described
         in this Section 9.4 or otherwise incurred due to a breach by Purchaser
         of its obligations under this Section 9.4. It is the parties' intent
         that all responsibility for and control of the Schedule 9.2(a) Matters
         transfer to Seller as of the Terminals Closing Date without further
         action on the part of the parties, except for the obligation of
         reasonable cooperation as described below.

              (b) Subsequent to the Terminals Closing, Purchaser shall cause the
         Terminals Companies to reasonably cooperate with and assist Seller in
         Seller's defense of the Schedule 9.2(a) Matters. Such cooperation shall
         include, without limitation, (i) retaining documents related to the
         Schedule 9.2(a) Matters as Seller shall reasonably request and (ii)
         causing employees of the Terminals Companies to be available to Seller
         and Seller's counsel, during business hours, for interviews and
         depositions relating to the Schedule 9.2(a) Matters.

<PAGE>   82

              (c) In taking all of the actions permitted or required by this
         Section 9.4, Seller shall act, at Seller's expense, on behalf of the
         Terminals Companies and shall have sole authority (including, without
         limitation, settlement authority and the authority to approve and cause
         the filing of pleadings, briefs and other documents on behalf of the
         Terminals Companies) and responsibility for and exercise sole and
         complete control of the Schedule 9.2(a) Matters. Upon Seller's written
         request to Purchaser, Purchaser shall cause the president or other
         executive officer of the relevant Terminals Company to execute any
         document and agreement, including any settlement agreement with respect
         to the Schedule 9.2(a) Matters as required by Seller. Notwithstanding
         the foregoing, (i) Seller shall not be entitled to take or omit to take
         action with respect to the Schedule 9.2(a) Matters, and (ii) Purchaser
         will not be required to cause the relevant Terminals Company to execute
         any document or agreement with respect to the Schedule 9.2(a) Matters,
         if, in either case, such would result in a restriction on Purchaser,
         any Terminals Company or any of their Affiliates.

              (d) For purposes of this Section 9.4, in determining whether
         reasonable cooperation has been exercised, no consideration shall be
         given to the fact of Seller's indemnity of Terminals Purchaser
         Indemnified Parties, and the conduct of Purchaser shall be evaluated as
         if neither Purchaser nor the Terminals Companies were indemnified by
         Seller on the Schedule 9.2(a) Matters.

         Indemnified Party of any of the guarantee or other obligations set
         forth on Schedule 5.8 and any and all Calnev Losses related to
         environmental matters incurred by Seller pursuant to contractual
         indemnification obligations of the Calnev Companies to third parties
         related to previously divested assets or businesses, including, without
         limitation, those indemnification obligations set forth on Appendix A
         to Schedule 9.2(a) attached hereto;

              (f) [Intentionally omitted];

              (g) shut-down benefits under any Seller Pension Plan subsequent to
         the Calnev Closing or the New Calnev Closing (as applicable) triggered
         by the termination of an employee of Calnev on or after the Calnev
         Closing Date or the New Calnev Closing Date (as applicable) and on or
         before the fifth anniversary of the Calnev Closing Date or the New
         Calnev Closing Date (as applicable); or

              (h) any contamination of air, soil or ground water by any Calnev
         Company (or any predecessor of a Calnev Company), or for which any
         Calnev Company (or any predecessor of any Calnev Company) is or may by
         law or contract become liable (including, but not limited to, the
         remediation and other environmental indemnification obligations of any
         Calnev Company set forth on Appendix A to Schedule 9.2(a) attached
         hereto), or the violation of any applicable Environmental Law by any
         Calnev Company (or any predecessor of any Calnev Company), including
         but not limited to the failure of Purchaser to adequately fund or
         discharge the remediation obligations of any Calnev Company (or any
         predecessor of any Calnev Company) pursuant to any statute or
         regulations or any order or directive issued by an agency under
         applicable Environmental Laws; provided, however, that the
         indemnification provided by this paragraph 9A.3(h) shall not apply to
         any contamination that was required to be disclosed by Seller pursuant
         to Section 2A.18 but was not so disclosed.

                                   ARTICLE 9B
                     SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION GENERALLY

         9B.1 Claims. As promptly as is reasonably practicable after becoming
aware of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement not involving a claim,
or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding, of the type described in
Section 9B.2, the Indemnified Person shall give notice to the Indemnifying
Person of such claim, which notice shall specify the facts alleged to constitute
the basis for such claim, the representations, warranties, covenants and
obligations alleged to have been breached and the amount that the Indemnified
Person seeks hereunder from the Indemnifying Person, together with such
information as may be necessary for the Indemnifying Person to determine that
the limitations in Section 9B.7 or Section 9B.8 (as applicable) have been
satisfied or do not apply.

         9B.2 Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense. The
Indemnified Person shall give notice as promptly as is reasonably practicable to
the Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of
any suit, action or proceeding, by any Person not a party hereto in respect of
which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement (which notice shall specify
in reasonable detail the nature and amount of such claim together with such




                                       74
<PAGE>   86


information as may be necessary for the Indemnifying Person to determine that
the limitations in Section 9B.7 or Section 9B.8 (as applicable) have been
satisfied or do not apply). The Indemnifying Person may, at its own expense, (a)
participate in the defense of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding and (b)
upon notice to the Indemnified Person, at any time during the course of any such
claim, suit, action or proceeding, assume the defense thereof with counsel of
its own choice and in the event of such assumption, shall have the exclusive
right, subject to clause (i) of Section 9B.3, to settle or compromise such
claim, suit, action or proceeding. If the Indemnifying Person assumes such
defense, the Indemnified Person shall have the right (but not the duty) to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Person. Whether or not
the Indemnifying Person chooses to defend or prosecute any such claim, suit,
action or proceeding, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense
or prosecution thereof.

         9B.3 Settlement or Compromise. Any settlement or compromise made or
caused to be made by the Indemnified Person (unless the Indemnifying Person has
the exclusive right to settle or compromise under clause (b) of Section 9B.2) or
the Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, of any such claim, suit, action or
proceeding of the kind referred to in Section 9B.2 shall also be binding upon
the Indemnifying Person or the Indemnified Person, as the case may be, in the
same manner as if a final judgment or decree had been entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction in the amount of such settlement or compromise; provided,
that (i) no obligation, restriction, Terminals Loss or Calnev Loss shall be
imposed on the Indemnified Person as a result of such settlement or compromise
without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, and (ii) the Indemnified Person will not compromise or settle any
claim, suit, action or proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         9B.4 Time Limits. Any right to indemnification or other recovery under
Article 9 or Article 9A shall only apply to Terminals Losses or Calnev Losses
with respect to which the Indemnified Person shall have notified the
Indemnifying Person within the applicable time period set forth in Section 9.2
or 9.3 or Section 9A.2 or 9A.3, as the case may be. If any claim for
indemnification or other recovery is timely asserted, the Indemnified Person
shall have the right to bring an action, suit or proceeding with respect to such
claim within one year after first giving the Indemnifying Person notice thereof,
but may not bring any such action, suit or proceeding thereafter.

         9B.5 Net Losses and Subrogation.

              (a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
         amount of any Losses incurred or suffered by an Indemnified Person
         shall be calculated after giving effect to (i) any insurance proceeds
         received by the Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) with
         respect to such Terminals Losses or Calnev Losses, (ii) any Tax benefit
         realized by the Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates; provided,
         however, that for this purpose only the term "Affiliate" shall not
         include upstream Affiliates of Purchaser) arising from the facts or
         circumstances giving rise to such Terminals Losses or Calnev Losses and
         (iii) any recoveries obtained by the Indemnified Person (or any of its
         Affiliates) from any other third party. Each Indemnified Person shall
         exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such proceeds,
         benefits and recoveries. If any





                                       75
<PAGE>   87


         such proceeds, benefits or recoveries are received by an Indemnified
         Person (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to any Terminals Losses
         or Calnev Losses after an Indemnified Person has received
         indemnification from an Indemnifying Person with respect thereto, the
         Indemnified Person (or such Affiliate) shall pay to the Indemnifying
         Person the amount of such proceeds, benefits or recoveries (up to the
         amount of the Indemnifying Person's payment). Purchaser shall be
         obligated under this Section 9B.5 notwithstanding Section 9.4(a).

              (b) Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Person in respect of
         any Terminals Losses or Calnev Losses, the Indemnifying Person will, to
         the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the
         Indemnified Person (and its Affiliates) against any third party in
         respect of the Terminals Losses or Calnev Losses to which such payment
         relates. Such Indemnified Person (and its Affiliates) and Indemnifying
         Person will execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary
         to evidence or further perfect such subrogation rights.

         9B.6 Purchase Price Adjustments. Any amounts payable under Section 9.2
or Section 9.3 or Section 9A.2 or Section 9A.3 shall be treated by Purchaser and
Seller as an adjustment to the Purchase Price except as to amounts previously
included as income or expense by Purchaser.

         9B.7 Limitations on Liability of Seller. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement:

              (a) Other than Terminals Title and Authorization Warranties,
         Calnev Title and Authorization Warranties and the representations and
         warranties set forth in Sections 2.3, 2.4(a)(i), 2.15, 2.23, 2A.3,
         2A.4(a)(i), 2A.15 and 2A.23 to all of which no limitation under this
         Section 9B.7(a) shall apply, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
         have the right to payment by Seller under Section 9.2(b) or Section
         9A.2(b) only if, and only to the extent that, the Purchaser Indemnified
         Parties shall have incurred

                  (i) as to any particular inaccuracy or breach, indemnifiable
              Losses in excess of $100,000, and

                  (ii) as to all inaccuracies and breaches, indemnifiable Losses
              (other than as excluded in clause (i)) in excess of one percent
              (1.0%) of the Purchase Price in the aggregate

              (it being understood, for purposes of clarification, that the
              basket and other thresholds set forth in this sentence shall not
              apply to Section 9.2(a), Section 9.2(c), Article 10, Section
              9A.2(c), Section 9B.7(d) and Article 10A). For purposes of
              calculating the $100,000 limitation in clause (i) of the previous
              sentence, all claims arising out of a single or recurring
              condition, event or circumstance shall be aggregated.

              (b) Except as provided in Section 9.2(a) to which no limitation
         under this Section 9B.7(b) shall apply, Seller shall have no liability
         under or in connection with this Agreement or the Related Agreements or
         the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including under
         Section 9.2(b), Section 9.2(c), Section 9A.2(b), Section 9A.2(c) or



                                       76

         otherwise for any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or
         warranty or for any breach of any covenant or obligations or for any
         other reason) in excess of

                  (i) as to all representations and warranties other than the
              Terminals Title and Authorization Warranties, the Calnev Title and
              Authorization Warranties, the Terminals Environmental Warranty,
              the Calnev Environmental Warranty and the representations and
              warranties set forth in Sections 2.3, 2.4(a)(i), 2.15, 2.23, 2A.3,
              2A.4(a)(i), 2A.15, and 2A.23, ten percent (10%) of the Purchase
              Price in the aggregate,

                  (ii) as to the Terminals Environmental Warranty and the Calnev
              Environmental Warranty, thirteen and one third percent (13.3%) of
              the Purchase Price in the aggregate, and

                  (iii) as to the Terminals Title and Authorization Warranties,
              the Calnev Title and Authorization Warranties, the covenants and
              obligations (including Section 4.15, Section 9B.7(d), Article 10
              and Article 10A), and the representations and warranties set forth
              in Sections 2.3, 2.4(a)(i), 2.15, 2.23, 2A.3, 2A.4(a)(i), 2A.15
              and 2A.23, the Purchase Price in the aggregate;

              provided, that in no event shall Seller's aggregate liability for
              any and all matters referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) exceed
              thirteen and one third percent (13.3%) of the Purchase Price in
              the aggregate and in no event shall Seller's aggregate liability
              for any and all matters referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
              exceed the Purchase Price in the aggregate. Any indemnification
              for Losses pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall in no way apply to,
              limit or be limited by Purchaser Indemnified Parties' right to
              indemnification under Article 9, Article 9A or Article 9B.

              (c) The sole and exclusive liability and responsibility of Seller
         to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under or in connection with this
         Agreement or the Related Agreements or the transactions contemplated
         hereby or thereby (including for any breach of or inaccuracy in any
         representation or warranty or for any breach of any covenant or
         obligation or for any other reason), and the sole and exclusive remedy
         of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to any of the
         foregoing, shall be as set forth in Article 9, Article 9A, Article 9B,
         Article 10 and Article 10A. To the extent that the Purchaser
         Indemnified Parties have any Losses for which they may assert any other
         right to indemnification, contribution or recovery from Seller (whether
         under this Agreement or under any common law or any statute, including
         any Environmental Law, or otherwise), Purchaser hereby waives, releases
         and agrees not to assert such right, and Purchaser agrees to cause each
         of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to waive, release and agree not to
         assert such right.

              (d) Except for matters for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
         are entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article 9, Article 9A or
         Article 9B, in no event shall Seller have any liability for any health,
         dental, life, disability or accidental death or dismemberment claim
         which is incurred on or after the Terminals Closing Date, the Calnev
         Closing Date or the New Calnev Closing Date (as applicable) by any
         Terminals




                                       77
<PAGE>   89


         Continuing Employees or Calnev Continuing Employee (as applicable) (or
         their eligible dependents) or any Losses relating thereto. For purposes
         of this paragraph (d), a claim (other than a workers' compensation
         claim) shall be considered incurred (i) in the case of a health or
         dental claim, on the date on which the services giving rise to the
         claim are rendered, (ii) in the case of a life insurance, death or
         dismemberment claim, on the date of the death or injury giving rise to
         the claim, (iii) in the case of a short-term disability claim, on the
         date for which the short-term disability payment is made, and (iii) in
         the case of a long-term disability ("LTD") claim, on the first day of
         the period for which LTD benefits are payable. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing provisions of this paragraph (d), Seller shall retain the
         liability for workers' compensation claims (including claims for
         related health and dental services) with respect to Terminals
         Continuing Employees and Calnev Continuing Employees, which claims
         arise out of workers, compensation accidents occurring prior to the
         Terminals Closing Date, the Calnev Closing Date or the New Calnev
         Closing Date (as applicable).

              (e) Except for matters for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
         are entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article 9, Article 9A or
         Article 9B, in no event shall Seller have any liability for any claims
         (or for any Losses relating thereto) which are first made after the
         Terminals Closing, the Calnev Closing or the New Calnev Closing (as
         applicable) or claims (or for any Losses relating thereto) which are
         first made after the Terminals Closing, the Calnev Closing or the New
         Calnev Closing (as applicable) and which arise out of or in connection
         with any services provided at any time by the Terminals Companies or
         Calnev (as applicable)

         9B.8 Limitations on Liability of Purchaser. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement:

              (a) Other than the Terminals Title and Authorization Warranties,
         the Calnev Title and Authorization Warranties and the representation
         and warranty set forth in Section 3.2 to all of which no limitation
         under this Section 9B.8(a) shall apply, the Seller Indemnified Parties
         shall have the right to payment by Purchaser under Section 9.3(a) and
         Section 9A.3(a) only if, and only to the extent that, the Seller
         Indemnified Parties shall have incurred

                  (i) as to any particular inaccuracy or breach, indemnifiable
              Losses in excess of $100,000, and

                  (ii) as to all inaccuracies and breaches, indemnifiable Losses
              (other than as excluded in clause (i)) in excess of one percent
              (1.0%) of the Purchase Price in the aggregate.

              For purposes of calculating the $100,000 limitation in clause (i)
              of the previous sentence, all claims arising out of a single or
              recurring condition, event or circumstance shall be aggregated.

              (b) Purchaser shall have no liability under or in connection with
         this Agreement or the Related Agreements or the transactions
         contemplated hereby or thereby (including under Section 9.3, Section
         9A.3 or otherwise for any breach of or inaccuracy

         in any representation or warranty or for any breach of any covenant or
         obligations or for any other reason) in excess of

                  (i) as to all representations and warranties other than
              Terminals Title and Authorization Warranties, the Calnev Title and
              Authorization Warranties and the representation and warranty set
              forth in Section 3.2, ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price in
              the aggregate, and

                  (ii) as to the Terminals Title and Authorization Warranties,
              the Calnev Title and Authorization Warranties, covenants and
              obligations, and the representation and warranty set forth in
              Section 3.2, the Purchase Price in the aggregate;

              provided, that in no event shall Purchaser's aggregate liability
              for any and all matters referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) exceed
              the Purchase Price in the aggregate.


                                   ARTICLE 10
               TAX MATTERS WITH RESPECT TO THE TERMINALS COMPANIES

         10.1 Liability for Taxes.

              (a) Seller shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold
         Purchaser, the Terminals Companies and their respective Affiliates
         harmless from any Taxes, together with any costs, expenses, losses or
         damages, including reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys'
         and accountants' fees and expenses, arising out of or incident to the
         determination, assessment or collection of such Taxes ("Terminals Tax
         Losses"), (i) imposed on or incurred by any of the Terminals Companies
         by reason of the several liability of the Terminals Companies pursuant
         to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous state, local
         or foreign law or regulation which is attributable to having been a
         member of any consolidated, combined or unitary group on or prior to
         the Terminals Closing Date, (ii) resulting from the Terminals Companies
         ceasing to be a member of the affiliated group (within the meaning of
         Code Section 1504(a)) that includes Seller, (iii) imposed on or
         incurred by the Terminals Companies with respect to any period (or
         portion thereof) prior to and including the Terminals Closing Date (the
         "Terminals Pre-Closing Date Period"), (iv) attributable to any
         discharge of indebtedness that may result from any capital
         contributions by Seller (or an Affiliate of Seller) to any of the
         Terminals Companies of any intercompany indebtedness owed by any of the
         Terminals Companies to Seller (or an Affiliate of Seller), (v)
         resulting from the actions taken under Section 4.12 of this Agreement,
         or (vi) relating to all income Taxes arising as a result of the sale of
         the Terminals Stock and the Terminals Sale; provided, however, that
         Seller shall not be liable or offer an indemnification for any amount
         of current liability accrual for Taxes to the extent reflected on the
         Terminals Closing Balance Sheet with respect to the Terminals
         Companies.

              (b) Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold
         Seller and its Affiliates harmless from any Terminals Tax Losses (i)
         imposed on or incurred by the Terminals Companies with respect to the
         period after the Terminals Closing Date or (ii)




                                       79
<PAGE>   91

         with respect to state and local Transaction Taxes incurred by Seller in
         connection with converting any of the Terminals Companies into limited
         liability companies pursuant to Section 4.8 hereof (provided, however,
         that the indemnification by Purchaser pursuant to this clause (ii)
         shall be limited to those Taxes in excess of the Transaction Taxes
         which would have arisen had the Terminals Companies been sold as
         corporations and an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code had
         been made).

              (c) Whenever it is necessary for purposes of this Article 10 to
         determine the portion of any Taxes imposed on or incurred by the
         Terminals Companies for a taxable period beginning before and ending
         after the Terminals Closing Date which is allocable to the Terminals
         Pre-Closing Date Period, the determination shall be made, in the case
         of property or ad valorem taxes or franchise taxes (which are measured
         by, or based solely upon capital, debt or a combination of capital and
         debt), on a per diem basis and, in the case of other Taxes, by assuming
         that the Terminals Pre-Closing Date Period constitutes a separate
         taxable period of the Terminals Companies and by taking into account
         the actual taxable events occurring during such period (except that
         exemptions, allowances and deductions for a taxable period beginning
         before and ending after the Terminals Closing Date that are calculated
         on an annual or periodic basis, such as the deduction for depreciation,
         shall be apportioned to the Terminals Pre-Closing Date Period ratably
         on a per diem basis). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
         any franchise Tax paid or payable with respect to any of the Terminals
         Companies shall be allocated to the taxable period during which the
         income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such Tax
         is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business for another
         taxable period is obtained by the payment of such franchise Tax.

              (d) Purchaser agrees to pay to Seller any refund received after
         the Terminals Closing Date by Purchaser or its Affiliates, including
         the Terminals Companies, in respect of any Taxes for which Seller is
         liable under clause (a) of this Section 10.1. Seller agrees to pay to
         Purchaser any refund received by Seller or its Affiliates in respect of
         any Taxes for which Purchaser is liable under clause (b) of this
         Section 10.1. The parties shall cooperate, each at its own expense, in
         order to take all reasonably necessary steps to claim any such refund.
         Any such refund received by a party or its Affiliate for the account of
         the other party shall be paid to such other party within 90 days after
         such refund is received.

              (e) Purchaser and Seller agree not to make or cause any election
         (including an election to ratably allocate items under Treasury
         Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)) to allocate tax items in a
         manner inconsistent with Section 10.1(c) hereof.

         10.2 Tax Returns.

              (a) Seller shall cause to be included in the consolidated federal
         income Tax Returns (and the state income Tax Returns of any state that
         permits consolidated, combined or unitary income Tax Returns, if any)
         of the Parent Group (as defined herein) for all periods ending on or
         before the Terminals Closing Date and for periods which include the
         Terminals Closing Date, all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and
         credit ("Terminals Tax Items") of the Terminals Companies which are
         required to be included






                                       80

         therein, shall cause such Tax Returns to be timely filed with the
         appropriate Government Authorities, and shall be responsible for the
         timely payment of all Taxes due with respect to the periods covered by
         such Tax Returns. For purposes of this Agreement, "Parent Group" (i)
         means the affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of
         Section 1504 of the Code which files a consolidated federal income Tax
         Return and as to which Seller is a member, and (ii) in the case of any
         combined or unitary Tax Return, the group of corporations filing such
         Tax Return that includes any of the Terminals Companies or Calnev (as
         applicable).

              (b) With respect to any Tax Return covering a taxable period
         ending on or before the Terminals Closing Date that is required to be
         filed after the Terminals Closing Date with respect to any of the
         Terminals Companies that is not described in paragraph (a) above,
         Seller shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared, shall cause to be
         included in such Tax Return all Terminals Tax Items required to be
         included therein, shall cause such Tax Return to be filed timely with
         the appropriate Government Authority, and shall be responsible for the
         timely payment of all Taxes due with respect to the period covered by
         such Tax Return.

              (c) With respect to any Tax Return covering a taxable period
         beginning on or before the Terminals Closing Date and ending after the
         Terminals Closing Date that is required to be filed after the Terminals
         Closing Date with respect to any of the Terminals Companies, Purchaser
         shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared, shall cause to be included
         in such Tax Return all Terminals Tax Items required to be included
         therein, shall furnish a copy of such Tax Return to Seller, shall file
         timely such Tax Return with the appropriate Government Authority, and
         shall be responsible for the timely payment of all Taxes due with
         respect to the period covered by such Tax Return. Purchaser shall
         determine, in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.1(c) of the
         Agreement, the amount of Tax due with respect to the Terminals
         Pre-Closing Date Period (the "Seller's Terminals Tax") and shall notify
         Seller of its determination of the Seller's Terminals Tax. Seller shall
         pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the Seller's Terminals Tax not
         later than five days after the filing of such Tax Return. Any refund
         attributable to Tax Returns filed pursuant to this Section 10.2(c)
         shall be apportioned between Purchaser and Seller in a manner
         consistent with the calculation of the Seller's Terminals Tax.

              (d) Purchaser shall, with respect to any Tax Return which
         Purchaser is responsible under Section 10.2(c) for preparing and
         filing, make such Tax workpapers available for review by Seller if the
         Tax Return is with respect to Taxes for which Seller may be liable (in
         whole or in part) hereunder or under applicable law. Purchaser shall
         make such workpapers available for review no later than twenty (20)
         days before the due date for filing such Tax Returns to provide Seller
         with a meaningful opportunity to analyze and comment on such Tax
         Returns and have such Tax Returns modified before filing, accepting the
         position of Purchaser unless such position is contrary to the
         provisions of Section 10.2(e) hereof. If, within ten (10) days of such
         delivery, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a written statement
         describing Seller's objections to such Tax Return and all grounds
         therefor, and the parties are unable to resolve such objections within
         the ten (10) day period prior to filing such Tax Return, such Tax
         Return shall be filed as prepared by Purchaser, and any remaining
         disputes shall be resolved by the





                                       81
<PAGE>   93

         Terminals Arbitrating Accounting Firm as provided in Section 10.2(f).
         Seller will join in the execution of such Tax Return and other
         documentation if required to do so by applicable Law.

              (e) Any Tax Return which includes or is based on the operations,
         ownership, assets or activities of the Terminals Companies for any
         taxable period beginning before and ending after the Terminals Closing
         Date, and any Tax Return in respect of any Taxes for which Seller may
         be liable (in whole or in part) hereunder shall be prepared in
         accordance with past Tax accounting practices used with respect to the
         Tax Returns in question (unless such past practices are no longer
         permissible under the applicable law), and to the extent any items are
         not covered by past practices (or in the event such past practices are
         no longer permissible under the applicable tax law), in accordance with
         reasonable tax accounting practices selected by the filing party with
         respect to such Tax Return under this Agreement with the consent (not
         to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the non-filing party.

              (f) The Terminals Arbitrating Accounting Firm shall be instructed
         to resolve any disputes referred to it pursuant to Section 10.2(d)
         within five (5) days after such referral. The resolution of disputes by
         the Terminals Arbitrating Accounting Firm shall be set forth in writing
         and shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties and the parties
         shall join in the execution and cooperate in the filing of any amended
         Tax Return as shall be necessary to implement such resolution. The fees
         and expenses of the Terminals Arbitrating Accounting Firm shall be
         apportioned by the Terminals Arbitrating Accounting Firm based on the
         degree to which each party's claims were unsuccessful and shall be paid
         by the parties in accordance with such determination. For example, if
         pursuant to this Section 10.2(f) Seller submitted an objection
         affecting the amount of Tax due in the amount of $100,000 and prevailed
         as to $45,000 of the amount, then Seller would bear 55% of the fees and
         expenses of the Terminals Arbitrating Accounting Firm.

              (g) Unless required by law, Purchaser shall not file an amended
         Tax Return for any period ending on or prior to the Terminals Closing
         Date without the consent of Seller.

              (h) Subject to Section 10.1(b)(ii), all Transaction Taxes related
         to the Terminals Companies, whether levied on Purchaser or Seller or
         their respective Affiliates, shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by
         Purchaser, and Seller shall file all necessary documentation with
         respect to, and make all payments of, such Transaction Taxes and fees
         on a timely basis.

         10.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters.

              (a) Purchaser and the Terminals Companies and Seller shall
         cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
         party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this
         Article 10 and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect
         to Taxes although the party responsible for filing the Tax Return
         pursuant to this Agreement shall control any such audit, litigation or
         other proceeding, provided that the controlling party may not, without
         the consent of the other party, agree to any




                                       82
<PAGE>   94


         settlement which would result in an increase in the amount of Taxes for
         which any other party is or may be liable. Such cooperation shall
         include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the
         provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to
         any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees
         available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
         information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
         Purchaser and Seller agree (i) to retain all books and records with
         respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Terminals Companies relating to
         any Taxable Period beginning before the Terminals Closing Date until
         the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the
         extent notified by Purchaser or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the
         respective Taxable Periods, and to abide by all record retention
         agreements entered into with any taxing authority and (ii) to give the
         other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying
         or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so
         requests, the Terminals Companies, as the case may be, shall allow the
         other party to take possession of such books and records.

              (b) Purchaser and Seller further agree, upon reasonable request by
         the other party, to use all reasonable commercial efforts to obtain any
         certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any
         other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
         Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect
         to the transactions contemplated hereby).

         10.4 Carrybacks and Refunds. Any required amended Tax Return relating
to a Terminals Pre-Closing Date Period and any refund claims relating to a
Terminals Pre-Closing Date Period shall be prepared by Seller. Neither Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates shall file any Tax Return or any other document which
attempts to carry back to any Terminals Pre-Closing Date Period any item of
income, loss, deduction or credit (including, without limitation, any net
operating loss) incurred, created or sustained during any Tax period which ends
after the Terminals Closing Date.

         10.5 Survival. Anything to the contrary in this Agreement
notwithstanding, the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, rights
and obligations of the parties hereto with respect to any Tax matter related to
the Terminals Companies shall survive the Terminals Closing and shall not
terminate until the applicable Tax Statute of Limitations Date.

         10.6 Conflict. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of
this Article 10 and any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of
this Article 10 shall control.

         10.7 Transfer Taxes. Each of the Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate
with each other in the preparation and filing of all necessary documentation
related to Transaction Taxes in the State of Washington resulting from the
Terminals Sale within 30 days of the Terminals Closing. Any such Transaction
Taxes shall be shared in the manner set forth in Section 10.2(h).

                                  ARTICLE 10A
                TAX MATTERS WITH RESPECT TO THE CALNEV COMPANIES

         10A.1 Liability for Taxes.

               (a) Seller shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold
         Purchaser, the Calnev Companies and their respective Affiliates
         harmless from any Taxes, together with any costs, expenses, losses or
         damages, including reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys'
         and accountants' fees and expenses, arising out of or incident to the
         determination, assessment or collection of such Taxes ("Calnev Tax
         Losses"), (i) imposed on or incurred by any of the Calnev Companies by
         reason of the several liability of the Calnev Companies pursuant to
         Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous state, local or
         foreign law or regulation which is attributable to having been a member
         of any consolidated, combined or unitary group on or prior to the
         Calnev Closing Date, (ii) resulting from any of the Calnev Companies
         ceasing to be a member of the affiliated group (within the meaning of
         Code Section 1504(a)) that includes Seller, (iii) imposed on or
         incurred by any of the Calnev Companies with respect to any period (or
         portion thereof) prior to and including the Calnev Closing Date (the
         "Calnev Pre-Closing Date Period"), (iv) attributable to any discharge
         of indebtedness that may result from any capital contributions by
         Seller (or an Affiliate of Seller) to any of the Calnev Companies of
         any intercompany indebtedness owed by any of the Calnev Companies to
         Seller (or an Affiliate of Seller) or (v) relating to all income Taxes
         arising as a result of the sale of the GPL Stock and the Calnev Sale;
         provided, however, that Seller shall not be liable or offer an
         indemnification for any amount of current liability accrual for Taxes
         to the extent reflected on the Calnev Closing Balance Sheet with
         respect to the Calnev Companies.

               (b) Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold
         Seller and its Affiliates harmless from any Calnev Tax Losses (i)
         imposed on or incurred by any of the Calnev Companies with respect to
         the period after the Calnev Closing Date or (ii) with respect to state
         and local Transaction Taxes incurred by Seller in connection with
         converting any of the Calnev Companies into limited liability companies
         pursuant to Section 4A.5 hereof (provided, however, that the
         indemnification by Purchaser pursuant to this clause (ii) shall be
         limited to those Taxes in excess of the Transaction Taxes which would
         have arisen had the Calnev Companies been sold as corporations and an
         election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code had been made).

               (c) Whenever it is necessary for purposes of this Article 10A to
         determine the portion of any Taxes imposed on or incurred by any of the
         Calnev Companies for a taxable period beginning before and ending after
         the Calnev Closing Date which is allocable to the Calnev Pre-Closing
         Date Period, the determination shall be made, in the case of property
         or ad valorem taxes or franchise taxes (which are measured by, or based
         solely upon capital, debt or a combination of capital and debt), on a
         per diem basis and, in the case of other Taxes, by assuming that the
         Calnev Pre-Closing Date Period constitutes a separate taxable period of
         the Calnev Companies and by taking into account the actual taxable
         events occurring during such period (except that exemptions, allowances
         and deductions for a taxable period beginning before and ending after
         the Calnev Closing




                                       84
<PAGE>   96


         Date that are calculated on an annual or periodic basis, such as the
         deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned to the Calnev
         Pre-Closing Date Period ratably on a per diem basis). Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary herein, any franchise Tax paid or payable with
         respect to any of the Calnev Companies shall be allocated to the
         taxable period during which the income, operations, assets or capital
         comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the
         right to do business for another taxable period is obtained by the
         payment of such franchise Tax.

               (d) Purchaser agrees to pay to Seller any refund received after
         the Calnev Closing Date by Purchaser or its Affiliates, including any
         Calnev Company, in respect of any Taxes for which Seller is liable
         under clause (a) of this Section 10A.1. Seller agrees to pay to
         Purchaser any refund received by Seller or its Affiliates in respect of
         any Taxes for which Purchaser is liable under clause (b) of this
         Section 10A.1. The parties shall cooperate, each at its own expense, in
         order to take all reasonably necessary steps to claim any such refund.
         Any such refund received by a party or its Affiliate for the account of
         the other party shall be paid to such other party within 90 days after
         such refund is received.

               (e) Purchaser and Seller agree not to make or cause any election
         (including an election to ratably allocate items under Treasury
         Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)) to allocate tax items in a
         manner inconsistent with Section 10A.1(c) hereof.

         10A.2 Tax Returns.

               (a) Seller shall cause to be included in the consolidated federal
         income Tax Returns (and the state income Tax Returns of any state that
         permits consolidated, combined or unitary income Tax Returns, if any)
         of the Parent Group for all periods ending on or before the Calnev
         Closing Date and for periods which include the Calnev Closing Date, all
         items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit ("Calnev Tax Items")
         of the Calnev Companies which are required to be included therein,
         shall cause such Tax Returns to be timely filed with the appropriate
         Government Authorities, and shall be responsible for the timely payment
         of all Taxes due with respect to the periods covered by such Tax
         Returns.

               (b) With respect to any Tax Return covering a taxable period
         ending on or before the Calnev Closing Date that is required to be
         filed after the Calnev Closing Date with respect to each of the Calnev
         Companies that is not described in paragraph (a) above, Seller shall
         cause such Tax Return to be prepared, shall cause to be included in
         such Tax Return all Calnev Tax Items required to be included therein,
         shall cause such Tax Return to be filed timely with the appropriate
         Government Authority, and shall be responsible for the timely payment
         of all Taxes due with respect to the period covered by such Tax Return.

               (c) With respect to any Tax Return covering a taxable period
         beginning on or before the Calnev Closing Date and ending after the
         Calnev Closing Date that is required to be filed after the Calnev
         Closing Date with respect to Calnev, Purchaser shall cause such Tax
         Return to be prepared, shall cause to be included in such Tax Return
         all Calnev





                                       85
<PAGE>   97


         Tax Items required to be included therein, shall furnish a copy of such
         Tax Return to Seller, shall file timely such Tax Return with the
         appropriate Government Authority, and shall be responsible for the
         timely payment of all Taxes due with respect to the period covered by
         such Tax Return. Purchaser shall determine, in accordance with the
         provisions of Section 10A.1(b) of the Agreement, the amount of Tax due
         with respect to the Calnev Pre-Closing Date Period (the "Seller's
         Calnev Tax") and shall notify Seller of its determination of the
         Seller's Calnev Tax. Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to
         the Seller's Calnev Tax not later than five days after the filing of
         such Tax Return. Any refund attributable to Tax Returns filed pursuant
         to this Section 10A.2(c) shall be apportioned between Purchaser and
         Seller in a manner consistent with the calculation of the Seller's
         Calnev Tax.

               (d) Purchaser shall, with respect to any Tax Return which
         Purchaser is responsible under Section 10A.2(c) for preparing and
         filing, make such Tax workpapers available for review by Seller if the
         Tax Return is with respect to Taxes for which Seller may be liable (in
         whole or in part) hereunder or under applicable law. Purchaser shall
         make such workpapers available for review no later than twenty (20)
         days before the due date for filing such Tax Returns to provide Seller
         with a meaningful opportunity to analyze and comment on such Tax
         Returns and have such Tax Returns modified before filing, accepting the
         position of Purchaser unless such position is contrary to the
         provisions of Section 10A.2(e) hereof. If, within ten (10) days of such
         delivery, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a written statement
         describing Seller's objections to such Tax Return and all grounds
         therefor, and the parties are unable to resolve such objections within
         the ten (10) day period prior to filing such Tax Return, such Tax
         Return shall be filed as prepared by Purchaser, and any remaining
         disputes shall be resolved by the Calnev Arbitrating Accounting Firm as
         provided in Section 10A.2(f). Seller will join in the execution of such
         Tax Return and other documentation if required to do so by applicable
         Law.

               (e) Any Tax Return which includes or is based on the operations,
         ownership, assets or activities of the Calnev Companies for any taxable
         period beginning before and ending after the Calnev Closing Date, and
         any Tax Return in respect of any Taxes for which Seller may be liable
         (in whole or in part) hereunder shall be prepared in accordance with
         past Tax accounting practices used with respect to the Tax Returns in
         question (unless such past practices are no longer permissible under
         the applicable law), and to the extent any items are not covered by
         past practices (or in the event such past practices are no longer
         permissible under the applicable tax law), in accordance with
         reasonable tax accounting practices selected by the filing party with

         Arbitrating Accounting Firm shall be apportioned by the Calnev
         Arbitrating Accounting Firm based on the degree to which each party's
         claims were unsuccessful and shall be paid by the parties in accordance
         with such determination. For example, if pursuant to this Section
         10A.2(f) Seller submitted an objection affecting the amount of Tax due
         in the amount of $100,000 and prevailed as to $45,000 of the amount,

         Arbitrating Accounting Firm.

              (g) Unless required by law, Purchaser shall not file an amended
         Tax Return for any period ending on or prior to the Calnev Closing Date
         without the consent of Seller.

              (h) Subject to Section 10A.1(b)(ii), all Transaction Taxes related
         to the Calnev Companies, whether levied on Purchaser or Seller or their
         respective Affiliates, shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by
         Purchaser, and Seller shall file all necessary documentation with
         respect to, and make all payments of, such Transaction Taxes and fees
         on a timely basis.

         10A.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters.

               (a) Purchaser and the Calnev Companies and Seller shall cooperate
         fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
         connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article 10A
         and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes
         although the party responsible for filing the Tax Return pursuant to
         this Agreement shall control any such audit, litigation or other
         proceeding, provided that the controlling party may not, without the
         consent of the other party, agree to any settlement which would result
         in an increase in the amount of Taxes for which any other party is or
         may be liable. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
         the other party's request) the provision of records and information
         which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
         proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
         basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
         provided hereunder. Purchaser and Seller agree (i) to retain all books
         and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Calnev
         Companies relating to any Taxable Period beginning before the Calnev
         Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of
         limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or Seller, any
         extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable Periods, and to abide by
         all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority
         and (ii) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
         transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and,
         if the other party so requests, the Calnev Companies, as the case may
         be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and
         records.

               (b) Purchaser and Seller further agree, upon reasonable request
         by the other party, to use all reasonable commercial efforts to obtain
         any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or
         any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate
         any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
         respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

         10A.4 Carrybacks and Refunds. Any required amended Tax Return relating
to a Calnev Pre-Closing Date Period and any refund claims relating to a Calnev

of its Affiliates shall file any Tax Return or any other document which attempts
to carry back to any Calnev Pre-Closing Date Period any item of income, loss,
deduction or credit (including, without limitation, any net operating loss)
incurred, created or sustained during any Tax period which ends after the Calnev
Closing Date.

         10A.5 Survival. Anything to the contrary in this Agreement

respect to the representations and warranties contained in Article 2A hereof,
the Schedules attached hereto shall be deemed not to include any information or

from time to time prior to or at the Terminals Closing, Calnev Closing or the

Law or by any stock exchanges having jurisdiction over Seller, Purchaser or
their Affiliates.

         11.17 Defined Terms. Certain capitalized terms used herein shall have

Affiliates had not used the EINs subsequent to the Terminals Closing, the Calnev
Closing or the New Calnev Closing (as applicable) (it being understood that the
obligation of reimbursement pursuant to this sentence is in no way subject to or
limited by the provisions of Section 9B.7).
