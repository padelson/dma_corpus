representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
subject to the  terms and conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

respective meanings set forth or referenced in _Annex I_   attached hereto,
unless otherwise defined herein.

 

 

ARTICLE II

 

PURCHASE AND SALE OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS

 

 

2.1 _Purchase and Sale_. On and subject to the terms and conditions contained
herein, at the Closing, (a) Seller shall sell, transfer and  deliver the
Membership Interests free and clear of Liens to Buyer, (b) Buyer shall pay and
deliver the Closing Payments as provided in this Agreement and shall purchase,
acquire and accept the Membership Interests from Seller and (c) Seller shall 
cause Garlock to sell, transfer and deliver the Transferred Assets to Canadian

2.2 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Closing_ ") will take place remotely via the exchange of documents  and
signatures on the third Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of
each of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than those
conditions that are to be satisfied at the Closing), or  on such other date
as Seller and Buyer mutually agree (the " _Closing Date_ ") and will be deemed
effective as of the Effective Time; _provided_ that the Closing Date shall not
occur prior to December 31, 2019 without Buyer's prior

 


 

     

written consent. All proceedings to be taken and all documents (with the
exception of the Closing Transfer Documents) to be executed and delivered by
all parties at the Closing will be deemed to have been taken and  executed
simultaneously and no proceedings will be deemed to have been taken nor
documents executed or delivered until all have been taken, executed and
delivered.

 

 

2.3 _Estimated Purchase Price_. At least three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall furnish to Buyer (a) a certificate (the "
_Closing       Certificate_ ") setting forth Seller's good faith
estimate of (i) the amount of Closing Cash (the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ "),
(ii) the amount and calculation of each component of the Working Capital as of
the Effective Time (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "), including the
resulting Estimated Working Capital Underage (if any), (iii) the amount and

(iii), (b) reasonably detailed support documentation for each of the items set
forth in the  foregoing clause (a), and (c) an estimated balance sheet of the
Company as of the Effective Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "). Buyer
shall be entitled to review, and Seller shall consider in good faith the
modification of the Closing  Certificate proposed by Buyer; _provided_ ,
that, subject to the foregoing good faith consideration, the final
determination of the Closing Certificate and the calculations and amounts set
forth thereon shall be determined by Seller in its sole  discretion. Seller,
the Company, and their respective Representatives shall cooperate with and
make available to Buyer and its Representatives all information, records, data
and working papers, and shall permit access to their respective personnel 
involved in the preparation or review of the Closing Certificate during normal
business hours, as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation and analysis of the Closing Certificate and the resolution of any
disputes thereunder; _provided,_   that Seller's and the Company's
accountants will not be obligated to make any work papers available to any
Person except in accordance with such accountants' normal disclosure
procedures and then only after such Person has signed a customary  agreement
relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such accountants and neither Seller nor the Company will be
obligated to provide any information, records, data and working papers to the
extent  disclosure of such items would cause such party to lose the attorney-
client privilege with respect thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that if a
party is withholding any information pursuant to the foregoing exception it
shall notify the  other parties and, describe the information being so
withheld and, if requested, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide

protected information in a manner that would  not jeopardize the applicable
privilege.

 

 

2.4 _Closing Payments_. At the Closing, Buyer shall make the following
payments (collectively, the " _Closing Payments_ "):

2  

2.5 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

 

(a) _Final Statement_. Within 75 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to Seller a
statement (the " _Final      Statement_ ") setting forth Buyer's
calculation of (i) Working Capital as of the Effective Time (" _Closing
Working Capital_ ") and the resulting Closing Working Capital Underage (if
any), (ii) Company Debt as of immediately prior to the  Closing (" _Closing
Company Debt_ "), and (iii) Cash as of the Effective Time (" _Closing Cash_
"), along with reasonably detailed support documentation for each of the
foregoing.

 

 

(b) _Final Statement Dispute_. Within 45 days following receipt by Seller of
the Final Statement, Seller shall deliver written notice to Buyer of any
dispute it has  with respect to the preparation or content of the Final
Statement, specifying in reasonable detail the items or amounts in dispute,
the basis for such dispute and Seller's proposed modifications to the Final
Statement (such notice, a " _Dispute  Notice_ "). If Seller does not deliver
a Dispute Notice within such 45-day period, such Final Statement will be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties. Any matters not identified in a
Dispute Notice delivered in accordance with this _Section     _ _2.5(b)_
shall be deemed to have been agreed to and shall be conclusive and binding
upon the parties. In the event Seller delivers a Dispute Notice in accordance
with this _Section_ _2.5(b)_ , Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve such disputed items. If Buyer and Seller, notwithstanding such good
faith effort, fail to resolve such disputed items within 15 days after the 
delivery of the Dispute Notice, then Buyer and Seller jointly shall engage the
Arbitration Firm to resolve only such disputed items and/or items still in
dispute. In the event Buyer and Seller engage the Arbitration Firm, as
promptly as practicable  (and in no event later than 30 days thereafter),
Buyer and Seller shall each prepare and submit a written presentation to the
Arbitration Firm. As soon as practicable, and in no event later than 60 days
after its engagement, Buyer and Seller shall  cause the Arbitration Firm to
render a decision based solely upon the presentations by Buyer and Seller and
not by independent review. A copy of all materials submitted to the
Arbitration Firm pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be 
provided by Seller or Buyer, as applicable, to the other party concurrently
with the submission thereof to the Arbitration Firm to the extent permitted
under Law. In resolving any disputed item, the Arbitration Firm shall be
limited to picking from  or between the values assigned to each item by Buyer
and Seller, and may not assign a value to any item outside of the range of
values claimed for such item by either party. Buyer, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, will be responsible  for the fees and expenses of
the Arbitration Firm in proportion to its or their loss, if any, in any such
arbitration (e.g., if Buyer is awarded 60% of the difference between its claim
and the claim of Seller  through the arbitration proceeding, it must pay 40%
of the arbitrator's fees, and Seller must pay the remaining 60% of the
arbitrator's fees). The Arbitration Firm will render a written report setting
forth its determination as to the disputed  matters and the resulting
calculations of Closing Working Capital, Closing Company Debt, and Closing
Cash, and all such determinations made by the Arbitration Firm will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties to this Agreement, absent fraud  or
manifest error. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the dispute
resolution mechanism contained in this _Section_ _2.5(b)_ shall be the
exclusive mechanism for resolving disputes  regarding the Purchase Price
adjustment, if any, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be entitled to
indemnification for Losses pursuant

 


 

 

 

3  

to _Article_ _X_ to the extent expressly taken into account in the
determination of the Purchase Price or for matters adjudicated by the
Arbitration Firm. For the avoidance of doubt, the  Arbitration Firm shall
also resolve any disputes which may arise as to whether the terms and
procedures of this _Section_ _2.5_ have been complied with by the parties.

 

 

(c) _Access_. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this
_Section_ _2.5_ , Buyer and the Company, on  the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, shall cooperate with and make available to each other and their
respective Representatives all information, records, data and working papers,
and shall permit access to their respective personnel involved  in the
preparation or review of the Final Statement during normal business hours, as
may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation and analysis of
the Final Statement and the resolution of any disputes thereunder; _provided_
,  that none of Buyer's, Seller's or the Company's accountants will be
obligated to make any work papers available to any Person except in accordance
with such accountants' normal disclosure procedures and then only after such
Person has signed a  customary agreement relating to such access to work
papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants and
none of Buyer, Seller or the Company will be obligated to provide any
information, records, data and working papers to the  extent disclosure of
such items would cause such party to lose the attorney-client privilege with
respect thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that if a party is withholding any
information pursuant to the foregoing exception it shall notify  the other
parties and, describe the information being so withheld and, if requested, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide extracts or summaries of such
protected information or otherwise provide such protected information in a
manner that  would not jeopardize the applicable privilege. If Buyer and the
Company, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, breach their
respective obligations under this _Section_ _2.5(c)_ , the dispute  periods
set forth in _Section_ _2.5(b)_ shall automatically be extended until such
breach is cured by the breaching party.

 

 

(d) _Payment_. Within five Business Days after Working Capital, Company Debt
and Closing Cash is finally determined pursuant to _Section_ _2.5(a)_ and
_Section_ _2.5(b)_ :

 

 

(i) If Final Purchase Price _minus_ Estimated Purchase Price (such difference,
the " _Adjustment Amount_ ") (A) is positive, then Buyer shall pay to Seller
the  Adjustment Amount by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by Seller or (B) is negative, then Seller
shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the absolute value of the Adjustment
Amount by bank wire  transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Buyer.

 

 

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount is zero, then no additional payments shall be
required by Buyer or Seller, and the Estimated Purchase Price (and Estimated
Working Capital,  Estimated Company Debt and Estimated Closing Cash included
therein) shall be deemed to be the amount of the Purchase Price and be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties.

 

 

2.6 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

 

 

4  

(a) Within 60 days after the final determination of the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 2.5_ , Buyer will deliver or cause to be delivered to
Seller a draft  statement containing Buyer's allocation of the Purchase Price
among the assets of the Company (the " _Draft Allocation Statement_ "). The
Draft Allocation Statement will be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code and any comparable  provisions of state, local or foreign Law, as
appropriate. For a period of 30 days following the delivery of the Draft
Allocation Statement, Buyer and Seller agree to attempt to resolve any
disputes with respect to such Draft Allocation Statement in  good faith. If
Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any disputes within such 30 day period,
such unresolved disputes shall be submitted to the Arbitration Firm for final
determination in a manner consistent with _Section 2.5_ (and any fees  shall
be borne by the parties as described in _Section 2.5(b)_ ); _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Arbitration
Firm shall be bound by, and shall resolve any such disputes, in accordance
with  the Allocation Methodology. The allocation as finally agreed upon by
Buyer and Seller or as resolved by the Arbitration Firm (the " _Final
Allocation Statement_ ") shall be final for purposes of this _Section 2.6_.
Buyer, the Company and  Seller will report the allocation of the Purchase
Price among the assets of Company in a manner consistent with the Final
Allocation Statement and will act in accordance with the Final Allocation
Statement in the preparation and timely filing of all  Tax Returns (including
filing Form 8594 with their respective federal income Tax Returns for the
taxable year that includes the Closing Date and any other forms or statements
required by the Code or any applicable state or local taxing authority).

 

 

(b) Buyer and Seller will, and will cause Canadian Buyer and Garlock,
respectively, to, report the allocation of the Closing Transfer Payment among
the Transferred Assets  as provided in the Closing Transfer Documents and to
act in accordance with such allocation in the preparation and timely filing of
all Tax Returns.

 

 

2.7 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct  and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable (directly or indirectly) pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under Law. To the extent that
amounts are so  withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in
respect of which such withholding was made.

a Material Adverse Effect on the  Company.

 

 

(c) The Company has the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to be executed and
delivered by it, and to  consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Garlock has the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver

This Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which the Company or

executed and delivered by the Company or Garlock, as the case may be, and,
assuming the  due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties

this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements.

 

 

6.4 _Independent Investigation; No Reliance_. In connection with its
investment decision, Buyer and Canadian Buyer and/or their representatives
have inspected and conducted such reasonable independent review, 
investigation and analysis (financial and otherwise) of the Company as desired
by Buyer and Canadian Buyer. The consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby by Buyer and Canadian Buyer are not done in reliance upon any
representation or  warranty or omission by, or information from, Seller, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates, employees or representatives,
whether oral or written, express or implied, including any implied warranty of

delivered pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (f) through _(i)_ hereof, and each of

disclaim any other representations and warranties. Such purchase and
consummation are instead done on the basis of Buyer's and Canadian Buyer's own
investigation, analysis, judgment and assessment of the present and 
potential value and earning power of the Company, as well as those
representations and warranties by the Company and Seller, specifically and
expressly set forth in _Article IV_ and _Article V_ (in each case, as modified
by the  Schedules), and in the certificates delivered pursuant to _Section
3.1_ (f) through _(i)_ hereof, and each of Buyer and Canadian Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that it is sophisticated in both financial matters and
with respect to the  industry in which the Company operates. Each of Buyer
and Canadian Buyer further acknowledges that, except as expressly set forth in
_Article IV_ and _Article_ ___V_ (in each case, as  modified by the
Schedules), or in certificates delivered pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (f) through
_(i)_ hereof, none of Seller, the Company, nor any other Person has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy  or
completeness of any information regarding the Company, its business or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or regarding the probable success
or profitability of the Company or its business, and none of Seller, the
Company or any other  Person will have or be subject to any liability to
Buyer, Canadian Buyer or any other Person resulting from the distribution to
Buyer, Canadian Buyer or their Representatives or their use of any such
information, including any management presentation  distributed on behalf of
the Company relating to its business or other publications or data room
(including any electronic or "virtual" data room) information provided or made
available to Buyer, Canadian Buyer or their Representatives, or any other 
document or information in any form provided or made available to Buyer,
Canadian Buyer or their Representatives, including management presentations,
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the  contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit any
claims with respect to Fraud.

 

 

6.5 _Investment Purpose_. Buyer is acquiring the Membership Interests solely
for its own account for investment purposes and not with a present view to, or
for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution  thereof. Buyer is an
"accredited investor" as defined in Regulation D promulgated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Buyer
acknowledges that the shares of Membership Interests are not registered 
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws,
and that the Membership Interests may not be transferred or sold except
pursuant to the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended or pursuant to an  applicable exemption therefrom and subject to
state securities laws and regulations, as applicable. Buyer is able to bear
the economic risk of holding the Membership Interests for an indefinite period
(including total loss of its investment), and  has (either alone or together
with its advisors) sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risk of its
investment.

 

 

6.6       _No Financing_. Buyer will have at Closing access to
immediately available funds in a quantity sufficient to pay the Estimated
Purchase Price, any payments to be made by Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.5_  
and all of the other fees, costs and expenses to be paid by Buyer under this
Agreement. Buyer has delivered to Seller a correct and complete copy of the
executed limited guarantee, dated as of the date hereof, of Sponsor (the "
_Limited Guarantee_ ").       The amount of funds to be guaranteed by
Sponsor to Seller pursuant to the Limited Guarantee (the " _Equity Financing_
")

 

 

 

36  

will be sufficient to pay the Estimated Purchase Price and all of the other
fees, costs and expenses to be paid by Buyer at the Closing under this
Agreement. The Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and  constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligations of each of the parties thereto as and
to the extent set forth therein, except as such enforceability may be limited
by the General Enforceability Exceptions. There are no conditions precedent
or  other contingencies limiting the funding of the full amount of the
Limited Guarantee other than as expressly set forth in the Limited Guarantee.
No event has occurred which would result in any breach or violation of or
constitute a default (or an  event which with notice or lapse of time or both
could become a default) by any party to the Limited Guarantee. The Limited
Guarantee has not been amended or modified in any manner, and the Equity
Financing commitment contained therein has not been  terminated, reduced,
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect by Sponsor or any other party thereto,
and no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated
by Buyer or any other party thereto. Assuming the satisfaction or waiver  of
the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2_ , Buyer has no reason to believe
that the Equity Financing will not be available on the Closing Date.

 

 

6.7 _Solvency_. After giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, assuming (a) the accuracy of the representations and warranties in
_Article IV_ , (b) the performance by the Company  and Seller of their
respective obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, (c) that the Company is solvent immediately prior to the Closing
and (d) the most recent financial forecasts for the Business made available
to  Buyer by Seller and its Representatives prior to the date hereof have
been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to
be reasonable, (i) will be solvent (in that both the fair value of their 
assets will not be less than the sum of their liabilities and that the present
saleable value of their assets will not be less than the amount required to
pay their probable liabilities as they become absolute and matured),
(ii)      will have adequate capital with which to engage in their
business, and (iii) will not have incurred liabilities beyond their ability to
pay as they become absolute and matured.

 

 

6.8 _Legal Proceedings_. There is no Action pending that relates to this
Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened  against or
affecting Buyer or any of its Affiliates that challenges the validity or
enforceability of this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements or seeks
to enjoin or prohibit consummation of, or seeks other material equitable
relief with  respect to, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the other Transaction Agreements or that would reasonably be expected to
impair or delay Buyer's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other  Transaction Agreements.

 

 

6.9 _Foreign Ownership or Control_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.9_ ,
Buyer and its directors, officers,  and other individuals having primary
management or supervisory responsibilities of Buyer: (a) are U.S. citizens or
companies, and (b) are not a "foreign person" as that term is used in 31
C.F.R. Part 800. No foreign person, individually or in the  aggregate with
other foreign persons, holds an ownership interest sufficient to appoint a
member of any governing body of Buyer or any of its current or future
subsidiaries. Buyer is ultimately controlled exclusively by U.S. persons and
no direct or  indirect foreign investor holds any control rights in Buyer,
including any voting rights or the right to dispose of any direct or indirect
ownership interest in Buyer.

 

 

 

37  

6.10 _No  Brokers_. No broker, finder or similar agent has been employed by
or on behalf of Buyer, and no Person with which Buyer has had any dealings or
communications of any kind is entitled to any brokerage commission, finder's
fee or any  similar compensation in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

6.11 _GST Registration_. Canadian Buyer will at Closing be duly registered
under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and any other applicable 
provincial or territorial legislation for GST/HST purposes.

 

 

6.12 _No Other  Representations and Warranties_. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN THIS _Article VI_ (AS MODIFIED BY THE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES), AND THE
CERTIFICATES DELIVERED PURSUANT TO _SECTION 3.2(C)_   THROUGH _(E)_ HEREOF,
BUYER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN
EQUITY, AND ANY SUCH OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMED AND IF MADE, SUCH OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES  MAY NOT BE
RELIED UPON BY SELLER, THE COMPANY OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES AND
REPRESENTATIVES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, NOTHING IN
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL LIMIT ANY CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO FRAUD.

assets to any Person, then, and  in each such case, Buyer shall use

other manner), any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to

WARN Act arising after the Closing which result from actions taken by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates in the ninety (90) days following the Closing,
_provided_ ,  that such indemnification will not be provided unless Seller
provides Buyer with a list by date and location of all employees terminated by
the Company or the Business in the 90-day period prior to the Closing or such
other applicable look-back  period as is required to comply with the WARN
Act.

 

 

7.9 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the date which
is twelve months from the Closing (or  if earlier, the date of the employee's
termination of employment with the Company), Buyer shall and shall cause the
Company to provide each Business Employee who remains employed by Company
immediately after the Closing, or who commences employment  with Canadian
Buyer upon or after Closing (" _Company Continuing Employee_ ") with: (i)
annual base salary or base hourly wages which are no less than the annual base
salary or base hourly wages provided by the Company immediately prior to the 
Closing; (ii) target annual cash bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based
compensation or long-term incentive compensation), if any, which are no less
than the target annual cash bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based
compensation or  long-term incentive compensation) provided by the Company
immediately prior to the Closing under the applicable Employee Plan; and (iii)
retirement and material welfare benefits (excluding any defined benefit
pension, equity or equity-based, deferred  compensation, long-term incentive
compensation or post-termination or retiree welfare benefits) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the retirement and material
welfare benefits provided under the Employee Plans set forth on
_Schedule      4.10(a)_ in which such Company Continuing Employee
participates immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer shall provide compensation and benefits as required under any applicable
collective bargaining  agreement (for so long as such contract is in effect).

 

 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or its
Subsidiaries (excluding any equity or equity-based plans) in which any 
Company Continuing Employees will participate effective as of the Closing or
such later date as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement
(collectively, " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ "), Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Company or Canadian Buyer to,  recognize all service of the Company
Continuing Employees with the Company as if such service were with Buyer or

 

 

 

43  

Canadian Buyer, for purposes of vesting and determining eligibility to
participate in any Buyer Benefit Plan (excluding any defined benefit pension,
equity or equity-based, deferred compensation or  post-termination or retiree
welfare benefits) in which such Company Continuing Employees may be eligible
to participate after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , such service
shall not be recognized to the extent that (i) such  recognition would result
in a duplication of benefits or (ii) such service was not recognized under the
corresponding Employee Plan identified in _Schedule 4.10(a)_.

 

 

(c) Effective as of the Closing Date, or such later date as set forth in the
Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall or shall cause its Subsidiaries to
take such action  necessary so that the Company shall cease being a
participating employer in and any Company Continuing Employee shall cease
being an active participant in or accruing any benefit or compensation under
each Employee Plan other than the Company Plans  (collectively, the " _Seller
Plans_ "). Except as set forth in this Agreement or the Transition Services
Agreement, Seller or Seller's Affiliates (other than the Company) shall retain
all liabilities under the Seller Plans and any other benefit  plan, program,
policy or arrangement sponsored or maintained by Seller and its Affiliates or
to which Seller or its Affiliates has any liabilities (other than a Company
Plan).

 

 

(d) Seller and Buyer hereby agree that any Company Continuing Employee who (i)
as of the Closing Date is receiving or entitled to  receive short-term
disability benefits and who subsequently becomes eligible to receive long-term
disability benefits with respect to the same disability event, or (ii) as of
the Closing Date is receiving or entitled to receive long-term disability 
benefits, shall become eligible or continue to be eligible, as applicable, to
receive long-term disability benefits under a Seller Plan that is a long-term
disability plan in accordance with the terms of such Seller Plan.

 

 

(e) Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall take
such actions as are necessary to (i) fully vest all account balances of the
Company Continuing  Employees under the EnPro Industries, Inc. Retirement
Savings Plan (" _Seller 401(k) Plan_ "), (ii) make all employer contributions
under the Seller 401(k) Plan for all periods up to and including the Closing
Date without any regard to any last  day of work or hours requirement, and
(iii) to allow Company Continuing Employees to elect distributions and
rollovers of such distributions (including notes associated with plan loans)
to a 401(k) plan sponsored by Buyer or its Affiliates and to not  place any
such plan loans into default provided that such rollovers occur by the end of
the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the Closing Date
occurs.

 

 

(f) Seller sponsors the EnPro Industries, Inc. Retirement Program for
Employees of EnPro Industries, Inc. (the " _Seller Pension Plan_ "), which is
comprised of several  component documents including the Enpro Industries
Retirement Program for Hourly Employees (the " _Hourly Plan Document_ ") and
the Enpro Industries Retirement Program for Salaried Employees (the "
_Salaried Plan Document_ "). Further, certain  of the Company Continuing
Employees are "Members" under the Seller Pension Plan with accrued benefits
under the Salaried Plan Document or Benefit Schedule B of the Hourly Plan
Document (related to certain bargaining employees of the Company) 
(collectively, the " _Pension Plan Participants_ "). Seller acknowledges that
all Pension Plan Participants

 

 

 

44  

are fully vested in their Seller Pension Plan accrued benefits and have met
service requirements for early retirement benefits for all accrued benefits
through the Closing Date under the Seller  Pension Plan. With respect to the
Pension Plan Participants:

 

 

(i) As soon as administratively practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall establish or maintain, or cause to be established or maintained, a
defined benefit pension plan (the " _Buyer      Pension Plan_ ") for the
benefit of each Pension Plan Participant, which is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code and the trust which is a part of such plan
must be exempt from Tax under Section 501(a) of the Code.

 

 

(ii) For each Pension Plan Participant who, immediately prior to Closing, is
an active participant and is accruing and has an accrued benefit under the
Salaried Plan  Document (each, a " _Salaried Plan Participant_ "), as of the
Closing Date, the Buyer Pension Plan and such plan's trust (and any successor
to such plan or trust) shall provide benefits consistent with the Salaried
Plan Document based on (A) the  accrued benefit determined based on all
eligible compensation and credited service for the Salaried Plan Participant
as earned both before and after Closing, less (B) the amount of the accrued
benefit under the Salaried Plan Document as of the  Closing Date, subject to
any post-Closing amendments to the Buyer Pension Plan as Buyer may determine
consistent with applicable Law.

 

 

(iii) For each Pension Plan Participant who, immediately prior to the Closing,
has an accrued benefit under the Hourly Plan Document pursuant to the terms of
the Collective  Bargaining Agreement between the Company and the United Steel
Workers Local Union 1533 (dated August 19, 2017) (the "CBA" and such Pension
Plan Participants, the " _Union Pension Plan Participants_ "), the Buyer
Pension Plan and such plan's trust  (and any successor to such plan or trust)
shall provide Union Pension Plan Participants benefits consistent with the
terms of the Hourly Plan Document and CBA subject to any amendment to the
Buyer Pension Plan and the CBA as made from time to time in  accordance with
applicable Law, for any service occurring after the Closing Date.

 

 

(iv) The Buyer Pension Plan shall be responsible for all accrued benefit
obligations applicable to the Pension Plan Participants associated with any
compensation or service occurring on or after  the Closing Date under the
Buyer Pension Plan and for any changes to the Buyer Pension Plan made by Buyer
or its Affiliates after the Closing Date or as a result of any changes to the
CBA after the Closing Date. Seller shall be responsible only for  benefits
accrued (including any early retirement subsidies associated with such accrued
benefits) under the Seller Pension Plan as of the Closing Date and shall have
no liability with respect to any benefits accrued under the Buyer Pension Plan
from  and after Closing.

 

 

(v) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Buyer Pension Plan
shall take into account the service of each Pension Plan Participant with a
Seller or its Affiliates prior to the  Closing under the Seller Pension Plan
for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefits accruals (if
applicable) and,

 

 

 

45  

with respect to benefits accrued after the Closing Date, early retirement
subsidies in effect under the Seller Pension Plan as of the Closing; provided,
however, that such pre-Closing service shall  not be required to be taken
into account (A) to the extent that such service was not taken into account
for such purpose under the Seller Pension Plan pursuant to the terms of such
plan in effect as of the Closing or (B) to the extent such service 
recognition would result in the duplication of benefits. For the avoidance of
doubt, the amount of any pension benefits provided by Buyer or its Affiliates
to the Pension Plan Participants, including to the Union Pension Plan
Participants as  required under the CBA, shall be offset by any pension
benefits payable to the applicable Pension Plan Participants pursuant to the
Seller Pension Plan to the extent the Buyer Pension Plan calculates benefits
based on the Union Pension Plan  Participants' compensation or service with
Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing.

 

 

(vi) Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist each
other in the establishment of the Buyer Pension Plan and continuing
administration of the  Buyer Pension Plan and Seller Pension Plan in
effectuating the provisions of this _Section 7.9(f)_.

 

 

(g) Certain Business Employees have account balances under the EnPro
Industries, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the " _Seller Deferred
Compensation Plan_ "). Consistent  with the terms of the Seller Deferred
Compensation Plan and applicable Law (including Section 409A of the Code),
Seller shall cause the portion of the Seller Deferred Compensation Plan
applicable to the Business Employees to be terminated as of the  Closing and
the account balances of such Business Employees cashed out in a single cash
payment within 30 days after the Closing Date.

 

 

(h) With respect to each Company Continuing Employee, effective as of the
Closing Date or such later date as set forth in the Transition Services
Agreement (the " _FSA Transfer Date_ "), the  Company Continuing Employee
shall cease to contribute to Seller's flexible spending account plan (the "
_Seller FSA Plan_ "). Company Continuing Employee who elected to participate
in the Seller FSA Plan for the plan year beginning January 1 of  the year
during which the Closing occurs (or January 1 of the year in which benefits
are no longer provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement) shall
become participants in a flexible spending account plan established by Buyer
or its  Affiliates on or as soon as administratively practicable following
the Closing Date (the " _Buyer FSA Plan_ ") as if their participation in the
Buyer FSA Plan had been continuous from such January 1 and at the same level
of coverage elected under  the Seller FSA Plan. Following the FSA Transfer
Date, each Company Continuing Employee will be reimbursed by Buyer or its
Affiliates under the Buyer FSA Plan for qualifying medical and dependent care
expenses incurred by such Company Continuing  Employee at any time during the
year during which the Closing occurs, up to the amount of the elections made
by each Company Continuing Employee under the Seller FSA Plan for such year,
reduced by amounts previously reimbursed by Seller or its  Affiliates
pursuant to the Seller FSA Plan for such year. To effectuate the foregoing, as
soon as practicable after the FSA Transfer Date, Seller shall provide Buyer
with a summary of account balances and confirm whether the amounts of the
account  balances (if any) under the Seller FSA Plan for the Company
Continuing Employee are

 

 

 

46  

positive or negative in the aggregate immediately prior to the FSA Transfer
Date, and Seller shall pay in cash to Buyer such aggregate balance (if
positive) or Buyer shall pay in cash to Seller such  aggregate balance (if
negative) with respect to all Company Continuing Employee who become covered
under the Buyer FSA Plan for the plan year during which the Closing occurs.

 

 

(i) This _Section 7.9_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 7.9_
,  express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 7.9_.
Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish,
amend or modify any  Employee Plan, Buyer Benefit Plan or any other benefit
or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement, and nothing
shall prohibit or limit the ability of Buyer or the Company to amend, modify
or terminate any benefit or compensation  plan, program policy, agreement or
arrangement at any time. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
terms set forth in this _Section 7.9_ shall not create any right in any
employee or any other Person to any continued employment with  the Company,
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any
nature or kind whatsoever. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.9_ ,
the terms and conditions of Business Employees covered by a collective 
bargaining agreement shall be governed exclusively by the terms of such
collective bargaining agreement.

 

 

7.10 _Taxes_.

 

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. Each of Buyer and Seller shall be liable for 50% of any
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes
(other  than GST/HST), and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other
fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection
with consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(excluding any Taxes, fees or  charges based in whole or in part on gross or
net income) imposed on the Company or Seller as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "). Seller
agrees to cooperate with Buyer in the filing of  any returns with respect to
the Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying any information in its
possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such returns.

 

 

(b) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing, allocation and indemnity
agreements and similar agreements with respect to or involving the Company
shall be terminated as of the Closing  Date, and, after the Closing Date, the
Company shall not be bound thereby or have any liability or obligation
thereunder.

with respect to any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (such taxable  period, a " _Straddle Period_ ") shall be
prorated (i) in the case of any real property, personal property and similar
ad valorem Taxes, on a daily basis based upon the number of days in the
portion of such taxable period that ends on and includes  the Closing Date
and the number of days in the portion of such taxable period after the Closing
Date,

 

 

 

47  

and (ii) in the case of any other Taxes, on the basis of a deemed closing of
the books as of the end of the Closing Date.

 

 

(d) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns and Refunds_.

 

 

(i) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns required to
be filed by the Company after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period. Any  such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and, with respect to any
Tax Return reflecting a material amount of Taxes for which Seller is liable
hereunder, Buyer shall submit a draft  thereof to Seller (together with
schedules, statements and, to the extent requested by Seller, supporting
documentation) prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return
(and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to submit  such draft to
Seller at least 20 days prior to such due date). If Seller objects to any item
on any such Tax Return, it shall, within 10 days after delivery of such Tax
Return, notify Buyer in writing that it so objects, specifying with 
particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal basis
for any such objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly delivered,
Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to  resolve such items. If Buyer and Seller are unable to
reach such agreement within 10 days after receipt by Seller of such notice,
the disputed items shall be resolved by the Arbitration Firm in accordance
with the procedures outlined in _Section  2.5(b)_. The preparation and filing
of any Tax Return of the Company that does not relate to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be exclusively within the control of Buyer.

 

 

(ii) Seller shall not amend any Tax Return related to Pre-Closing Tax Periods
without the written consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld.   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
Transaction Tax Deduction shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, be
reported in Pre-Closing Tax Periods. All refunds of Taxes of the Company for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period  (whether in the form of cash received or a credit
or offset against Taxes otherwise payable) (a " _Tax Refund_ ") shall be the
property of Seller to the extent such Tax Refund does not arise as a result of
a Transaction Tax Deduction. To the  extent that Buyer, the Company, or any
of their respective Affiliates receives a Tax Refund that is property of
Seller, Buyer shall pay (or cause the Company to pay) to Seller the amount of
such Tax Refund within 10 days after receipt of the Tax  Refund from the
applicable Governmental Authority (or, if the Tax Refund is in the form of
credit or offset, 10 days after the due date of the Tax Return claiming such
credit or offset).

 

 

(e) _Cooperation_. After the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection
with the  preparation and filing of any Tax Return and any audit, litigation
or other proceeding with respect to Tax Returns or Taxes of the Company. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request)
the provision of records  and information which are reasonably relevant to
any such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other proceeding or any tax

 

 

 

48  

planning, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any materials provided
hereunder; _provided_ , that the party  requesting assistance shall pay the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the party providing such
assistance; _provided_ , _further_ , no party shall be required to provide
assistance at times or in amounts that would interfere  unreasonably with the
business and operations of such party. For any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Tax Returns or Taxes of the Company related to a
pre-Closing Tax Period for which Seller would reasonably be expected to have 
liability hereunder (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Contest_ "): (i) the Buyer shall
keep the Seller reasonably informed with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax
Contest, and (ii) the Buyer or the Company shall not settle or otherwise
resolve such Pre-Closing  Tax Contest without Seller's consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

 

(f) _Treatment of Purchase_. For U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and
applicable state and local income Tax purposes), the parties hereto agree to
treat the  purchase of the Membership Interests by Buyer and the sale of the
Membership Interests by Seller as a purchase by Buyer of all of the Company's
assets from Seller.

 

 

7.11 _Performance Bonds and Guarantees_. From the date hereof until the
Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller will 
cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) arrange for
substitute letters of credit, surety bonds, Buyer guarantees and other
obligations (collectively, " _Replacement Credit Support Arrangements_ ") to
replace (i) any Seller  Guarantees outstanding as of the date hereof and (ii)
any Seller Guarantees entered into in the ordinary course of business during
the period from the date hereof with Buyer's express written consent or (b)
allow for Buyer to assume all obligations  under each Seller Guarantee,
obtaining from the creditor, beneficiary or other counterparty a full release
(in a form reasonably satisfactory to Seller) of all parties liable, directly
or indirectly, for reimbursement to the creditor or fulfillment  of other
obligations to a beneficiary or counterparty in connection with amounts drawn
under the Seller Guarantees, in each case to be effective at the Closing;
_provided_ that (x) Buyer shall not be obligated to assume any liabilities or
other  obligations or enter into any Replacement Credit Support Arrangements
with respect to any Seller Guarantee on terms or conditions less favorable to
Buyer than those of the applicable Seller Guarantee to be replaced or assumed
or in a form or amount  different than the applicable Seller Guarantee and
(y) Buyer shall not be obligated to enter into any Replacement Credit Support
Arrangement with respect to the guarantee by EnPro Industries Inc. (" _EnPro_
") included in the Agreement dated as  of December 11, 2019 by and among MAN
Energy Solutions SE, MAN Energy Solutions France, Buyer and EnPro (the " _MAN
Guarantee_ "). To the extent the beneficiary or counterparty under any Seller
Guarantees does not accept any such substitute  letter of credit, Buyer
guarantee or other obligation proffered by Buyer and with respect to the MAN
Guarantee, Buyer and the Company will, jointly and severally, (A) indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against, and  reimburse
Seller and its Affiliates for, all amounts paid (including costs or expenses)
in connection with such Seller Guarantees following the Closing, including
Seller's and its Affiliates' expenses in maintaining such Seller Guarantees,
whether or  not any such Seller Guarantee is drawn upon or required to be
performed, and will in any event promptly reimburse Seller and its Affiliates
to the extent any Seller Guarantee is called upon following the Closing and
Seller or its Affiliates makes any  payment or is obligated to reimburse the
party issuing the Seller Guarantee following the Closing and (B) not without
Seller's prior written consent, amend in any manner adverse to Seller or any

 

 

 

49  

of its Affiliates, or extend (or permit the extension of), any Seller
Guarantee or any obligation supported by any Seller Guarantee. Seller shall
terminate all Company Guarantees with no further liability to the  Company,
effective as of and conditioned on the Closing.

 

 

7.12 _Cooperation with Financing_. Seller shall, and shall cause the Company
and its and their respective employees and representatives to, use
commercially reasonable  efforts to provide, at Buyer's sole cost and
expense, such assistance and cooperation as Buyer may reasonably request in
connection with obtaining debt financing (if any) in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Debt Financing_ "),     
including (a) using commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the
marketing efforts of Buyer and its financing sources, (b) upon reasonable
prior notice, making senior management of the Company reasonably available
during normal business  hours for customary presentations or meetings with

Buyer with (i) all available pertinent financial statements and other
financial  information of the Company and (ii) all available and customary

Company; provided, further, that the Company and its  officers, employees,
and other representatives shall have no obligation to: (A) approve, authorize
or ratify the execution of any of the definitive documents in respect of the
Debt Financing (other than customary authorization letters) that would be

(B) take any action prior to the Closing that would conflict with any Law or

the Canadian Business, Seller shall cause Garlock to enter into the Bill of

Documents_ "), which details the transfer, which transfer shall occur, for
greater certainty, immediately after the acquisition of the Membership
Interests by Buyer, of the Transferred Assets,  Assumed Liabilities and
Business Employees employed by Garlock from Garlock to the Canadian Buyer (the
" _Closing Transfers_ ").

 

 

7.14 _Pre-Closing Transfers_. At or immediately prior to the Closing as
provided on _Schedule 7.14_ , Seller shall enter into the agreements set forth
on _Schedule      7.14_ , in each case in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Buyer (the " _Pre-Closing Transfer Documents_ "), which shall
effectuate the transactions set  forth on _Schedule 7.14_ (the " _Pre-Closing
Transfers_ ").

 

 

7.15 _Assignment of Certain Transferred Assets_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither this Agreement nor any
agreement or  instrument entered into in order to effect the Closing
Transfers shall constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any Transferred
Asset in the Closing Transfers or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom if an  attempted assignment or transfer
thereof, without the consent of a third party (including any Government
Authority), would constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or a
violation of Law. Seller will, and will cause Garlock to, use  commercially
reasonable efforts, during the period beginning on the date hereof and ending
45 days following the Closing Date, to cooperate with Buyer to obtain any
consent necessary for the transfer or assignment of any such Transferred Asset
to the  Canadian Buyer. If, on the Closing Date, any such consent has not
been obtained, Seller and Buyer will cooperate in a mutually agreeable
arrangement under which (a) the Canadian Buyer would, in compliance with Law,
obtain the benefits and assume,  perform and pay the obligations and bear the
economic burdens associated with such Transferred Asset in accordance with
this Agreement, and (b) Seller would take or cause to be taken at Buyer's
expense such actions as Buyer may reasonably request so  as to provide the
Canadian Buyer with the benefits of such Transferred Asset (collectively, "
_Third Party Rights_ "), including subcontracting, sublicensing or leasing all
or any portions of such Transferred Assets to the Canadian Buyer, and  Seller
would promptly pay or cause to be paid to the Canadian Buyer when received all
monies received under any such Transferred Asset (net of expenses incurred in
connection with any assignment contemplated by this _Section 7.15_ ). Buyer 
shall indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates, successors and assigns
harmless from and against any and all Losses based upon, arising out of or
relating to the Canadian Buyer's performance of, or failure to perform, such
obligations associated  with any such Transferred Asset after the Closing,
except to the extent such Losses are based on, arising out of or relating to
Seller's or its Affiliates' gross negligence, bad faith, fraud, or breach of
the Transaction Agreements.

 

 

7.16 _Intercompany Obligations_. Seller will take or cause to be taken such
action and make or cause to be made such payments as may be necessary  so
that, as of the Effective Time, there will be no intercompany obligations or
liabilities between the Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company), on the other hand (other than (a)
pursuant to this  Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, (b) as set
forth on _Schedule 7.16_ , or (c) any Seller Guarantees that remain
outstanding pursuant to _Section 7.11_ ), and Seller

 

 

 

51  

shall be solely responsible for any liabilities arising therefrom or related
thereto (other than as specified in _Section 7.11_ ).

 

 

7.17 _Resignations_. At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer
the resignation of all members of the board of directors (or other similar
governing  body) and officers of the Company requested by Buyer in writing at
least five Business Days prior to Closing, which resignations shall be
effective at the Closing.

 

 

7.18 _Exclusive Dealings_. From the date hereof until the Closing or the
earlier termination of this Agreement, neither Seller nor the Company shall,
and shall cause  their respective Affiliates and Representatives not to, take
any action to solicit, knowingly encourage, initiate or engage in discussions
or negotiations with, or provide any information to, enter into any agreement
with, or furnish any confidential  information to any Person (other than
Buyer or its Representatives or Affiliates) concerning any purchase of any of
the Company's equity securities or any merger, sale of substantial assets,
other than assets sold in the ordinary course of business,  or similar
transaction involving the Company or Seller (solely with respect to the
Company or Garlock (as Related to the Business)) or the Business (each such
acquisition transaction, an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "). Seller and the
Company will  cease, and cause their respective Affiliates and
Representatives to cease, and cause to be terminated any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Buyer and
its Affiliates and Representatives) conducted  prior to or on the date hereof
with respect to any Acquisition Transaction. In the event that Seller, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives receives an
Acquisition Transaction proposal after the date hereof but prior  to the
Closing, Seller will provide Buyer with prompt notice thereof, which notice
shall include the terms of, and the identity of the Person or Persons making,
such Acquisition Transaction proposal.

 

 

7.19 _Rights to Names._

 

 

(a) Except as expressly provided in this _Section 7.19_ , any and all rights
of Seller and its Affiliates to use the Names shall terminate as of the
Closing and shall  immediately revert to Buyer and its Affiliates (including
the Company), along with any and all goodwill associated therewith. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall, and shall cause its
applicable Affiliates to, use  commercially reasonable efforts to as promptly
as practicable following the Closing, but in no event later than thirty (30)
days after the Closing, change their corporate or company name to remove any
reference to the Names and file in each  jurisdiction in which such Person is
qualified to do business all documents necessary to reflect such change of
name or to terminate its qualification in such jurisdiction under such name.

 

 

(b) Seller, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that after the Closing Date,
Seller and its Affiliates (i) will not expressly, or by implication, do
business as or represent themselves under  the Names, (ii) with respect to
Transferred Assets, or other assets managed, operated or leased by the Company
or Canadian Buyer after the Closing Date, will respond to any third party
inquiry regarding the Transferred Assets or other assets by  representing in
writing to the owners or lessors of such Transferred Assets or other assets
that such assets are those of Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company
and Canadian Buyer) and not those of Seller and its Affiliates and (iii)
will  cooperate with Buyer or any

 

 

 

52  

of its Affiliates (including the Company and Canadian Buyer) in terminating
any contracts which are not included among the Transferred Assets and pursuant
to which Seller licenses any Names to  customers.

 

 

(c) Seller, for itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that,
except to the extent expressly provided in this _Section 7.19_ , neither
Seller nor any of  its Affiliates will have any rights in any of the Names
(nor any rights to permit any third party to use any of the Names) and neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates will contest the ownership or validity of any
rights of Buyer or any of its  Affiliates (including the Company) in or to
any of the Names.

 

 

7.20 _Insurance_. After the Closing, Buyer shall have the right to assert
claims arising from or relating to facts, circumstances, events or matters
that occurred prior to the Closing and that constitute Assumed Liabilities or
are  otherwise liabilities of the Company under any applicable insurance
policies of Seller or its Subsidiaries in effect on or prior to the Closing
Date and relating to the Business, the Company or the Transferred Assets that
are written on an  "occurrence" basis under the policies set forth on
_Schedule 7.20_ (" _Occurrence Policies_ "), to the extent permitted under
such Occurrence Policies and subject to the applicable deductibles, up to the
full available coverage of such  Occurrence Policies. Seller hereby
authorizes Buyer to report such claims directly to the provider of such
Occurrence Policies; _provided_ that Buyer shall report such claims
simultaneously to Seller. At Buyer's request, and subject at all  times to
Buyer's direction and control, Seller shall, and its shall cause its
Affiliates to, provide reasonable participation and assistance in Buyer's
efforts to pursue and settle claims made against such Occurrence Policies;
_provided_ that  Buyer shall be solely responsible for its own costs and fees
in connection therewith and shall promptly reimburse Seller for reasonable
costs and fees incurred by Seller or its Affiliates in providing such
participation or assistance. Seller and  its Affiliates shall be entitled to
copies of all documents and correspondence related to such claims and to
discuss the status of such claims with the provider of the applicable
Occurrence Policies. Buyer shall be entitled to settle or compromise  any
claim for which it is seeking insurance coverage in excess of the deductible
under such Occurrence Policies; _provided_ that Buyer shall be solely
responsible for any liabilities incurred in connection therewith (including
the payment of  any deductible, self-insured retention or other cost with
respect to the applicable Occurrence Policy). For the avoidance of doubt,
Seller shall be responsible for any deductibles, self-insured retentions,
retentions and other retained amounts on  insurance coverage with respect to
any such losses not covered under such Occurrence Policies to the extent
relating to liabilities for which Seller is responsible by operation of law or
pursuant to this Agreement (including Excluded Liabilities).

 

 

7.21 _Wrong Pockets._

 

 

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that the Canadian Buyer may come into
possession of certain assets, properties or rights of Garlock that are not
Related to the  Business (the " _Other Assets_ ") as a result of the Closing
Transfers. If, following the Closing, either party reasonably determines that
Other Assets were transferred to the Canadian Buyer, the parties agree to
cooperate to transfer back to  Garlock such Other Assets as promptly as
practicable without the payment of consideration. The parties further
acknowledge and agree that certain assets of Seller or its Affiliates (other
than the Company), including Garlock, that are Related to the  Business (the
" _Other Business_

 

 

 

53  

_Assets_ " and together with the Other Assets, the " _Misplaced Assets_ ") may
inadvertently not be  transferred to the Company or Canadian Buyer in
connection with the Closing Transfers. If, following the Closing, either party
reasonably determines that Other Business Assets were not transferred to the
Company or Canadian Buyer, the parties  agree to cooperate to transfer such
Other Business Assets to the Company or Canadian Buyer or other designated
Affiliate of Buyer as promptly as practicable without the payment of any
further consideration. Without limiting the generality of the  foregoing,
with respect to any Misplaced Asset, the parties shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, (i) execute all such agreements, deeds or other
documents as may be necessary for the purposes of transferring, assigning
and  conveying such Misplaced Assets (or part thereof) or the relevant
interests in them to the other party, (ii) obtain all Consents from Persons
necessary or appropriate for the purposes of transferring, assigning, and
conveying such Misplaced Assets  (or part thereof) or the relevant interests
in them to the other party, (iii) complete all such further acts or things as
the other party may reasonably direct in order to transfer, assign, and convey
such Misplaced Assets (or parts thereof) or the  relevant interests in them
to the other party, (iv) hold such Misplaced Assets (or part thereof), or
relevant interest in such Misplaced Assets, in trust for the other party (to
the extent permitted by Law) until such time as the transfer is  validly
effected to vest the asset (or part thereof) or relevant interest in the
Misplaced Asset to the other party, and (v) until such time as such Misplaced
Asset is transferred to the appropriate party, comply with all applicable
covenants and  obligations with respect to any such Misplaced Assets held by
it, including the payment of any costs and expenses in connection therewith,
which shall be performed by such party or its applicable Affiliate for the
other party's account and such  other party shall promptly reimburse such
party for any such out-of-pocket costs, expenses or payments.

 

 

(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that Buyer or the Canadian Buyer may
come into possession of certain liabilities or obligations of Seller and its
Affiliates (including  Garlock) that are not Related to the Business (the "
_Other Liabilities_ ") as a result of the Closing Transfers or otherwise. If,
following the Closing, either party reasonably determines that Other
Liabilities were transferred to, or are held  by, Buyer or the Canadian
Buyer, the parties agree to cooperate to transfer back to Garlock or the
applicable Affiliate of Seller such Other Liabilities as promptly as
practicable without the payment of consideration and to execute all such 
agreements, deeds or other documents as may be necessary for the purposes of
effectuating the foregoing. The parties further acknowledge and agree that
Seller or its Affiliates may inadvertently hold or come into possession of
certain liabilities or  obligations Related to the Business not otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement or the Closing Transfer Documents as
liabilities or obligations of Seller or its Affiliates (the " _Other Business
Liabilities_ "). If following the Closing, either  party reasonably
determines that the Other Business Liabilities were transferred to or are held
by Seller or its Affiliates, the parties agree to cooperate to transfer to the
Company or the Buyer such Other Business Liabilities as promptly as 
practicable, without the payment of consideration and to execute all such
agreements, deeds, or other documents as may be necessary for purposes of
effectuating the foregoing.

 

 

(c) To the extent that, after the Closing Date, (i) Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company) receives any
payment, mail or instrument

 

 

 

54  

that is for the account of Seller or any of its Affiliates (excluding,
following the Closing, the Company) according to the terms of this Agreement,
Buyer shall promptly (but in no event later than 5  Business Days) deliver
such amount, mail or instrument to Seller, or (ii) Seller or any of its
Affiliates (excluding, following the Closing, the Company) receives any
payment, mail or instrument that is for the account of Buyer or any of its 
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company) according to the
terms of this Agreement, Seller shall promptly (but in no event later than 5
Business Days) deliver such amount, mail or instrument to Buyer. All amounts
due and payable  under this _Section 7.21(c)_ shall be due and payable by the
paying party in immediately available funds, by wire transfer to the account
designated in writing by the receiving party.

 

 

7.22 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 

 

(a) For a period of 3 years following the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and
shall cause EnPro and its Subsidiaries not to anywhere in the world, directly
or indirectly,  either for itself or through any other Person, engage in,
participate in, or permit Seller's name to be used by any enterprise engaging
in the Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 7.22_
shall prohibit EnPro and its  Subsidiaries from performing their obligations
under any Transaction Agreement.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in
_Section 7.22_ shall preclude EnPro or any Subsidiary thereof from engaging in
any manner  in any (i) De Minimis Business; (ii) ownership of securities of
any Person traded on any national securities exchange if EnPro or such
Subsidiary is not a controlling Person of, or a member of a group which
controls, such Person and does not,  directly or indirectly, own 5% or more
of any class of securities of such Person; or (iii) business activity that
would otherwise violate _Section 7.22_ that is acquired from any unaffiliated
Person after the Closing Date (an " _After-Acquired  Business_ ") or is
carried on by any currently unaffiliated Person that is acquired by or
combined with EnPro or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (an "
_After-Acquired Company_ "), so long as within 12 months after the 
consummation of the acquisition of the After-Acquired Business or the After-
Acquired Company, EnPro or its applicable Subsidiary signs a definitive
agreement to dispose, and subsequently disposes, of the relevant portion of
the business or securities  of the After-Acquired Business or the After-
Acquired Company (provided that such 12-month period shall be extended by an
additional 6 months if, at the end of such 12 -month period, all regulatory or
other Governmental Authority approvals for such  disposition shall not have
been obtained, all required notices with Governmental Authorities shall not
have been filed or made or all waiting periods imposed by applicable
Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate such disposition have not 
expired or been terminated) or at the expiration of such 12‑month period the
business of the After-Acquired Business or the After-Acquired Company complies
with _Section 7.22(a)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, EnPro and its
Subsidiaries will  not be required to dispose of any assets or securities of
an After-Acquired Business or After-Acquired Company if the business activity
thereof that would otherwise violate _Section 7.22(a)_ does not account for
more than the greater of (x) 15%  of the revenues of the After-Acquired
Business or After-Acquired Company (based on its latest annual financial
statements prior to the consummation of such acquisition) or (y) $10,000,000
in revenues. As used in this _Section 7.22(b)_ , "De  Minimis Business" means

 

 

 

55  

any passive investment in an unaffiliated third party in which (A) Seller and
its Affiliates collectively hold not more than 15% of the outstanding voting
securities or similar equity interests, (B)  the amount invested by Seller
and its Affiliates collectively is less than $10 million, and (C) Seller and
its Affiliates do not possess the right (through ownership of securities,
contract or otherwise) to designate a majority, or such higher amount 
constituting a controlling number, of the members of the board of directors
(or similar governing body) of such Person and do not otherwise control such
Person.

 

 

(c) For a period of 3 years following the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, employ,
hire or solicit any  Business Employees, or encourage any such employee to
leave his or her employment from the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or the
Business or hire any such employee who has left such employment, except that
the foregoing shall not prohibit (i) the  hiring or soliciting of any such
employee who is terminated by Buyer and its Affiliates after the Closing and
has been terminated for a period of at least 6 months or (ii) general
solicitations which are not directed at any such employees (it being 
understood and agreed that the hiring of any such employees shall not be
permitted by this clause (ii)).

 

 

(d) Seller will not, or will cause its Affiliates not to, disclose or use at
any time any information of a confidential or proprietary nature (whether or
not specifically  labeled or identified as "confidential"), in any form or
medium, that relates to the business, products or financial condition of the
Business (" _Confidential Information_ ") and will take all commercially
reasonable steps to safeguard such  Confidential Information and to protect
it against disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss and theft; _provided_ , that
the foregoing will not apply with respect to (i) disclosures to such Person's
counsel or independent auditors or other advisors,  in each case, on a
confidential basis, (ii) information required to be disclosed by Law, (iii)
information for which such Person has received a subpoena or similar demand
(provided in the case of _clauses_ _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ of this  sentence that
such Person shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, first, as
promptly as practicable upon receipt of such demand, furnish notice and a copy
to Buyer so that Buyer may, at Buyer's expense, seek an appropriate order or
other  remedy protecting such information; _provided_ , _further_ , that no
such notice will be required in respect of disclosures to any regulatory,
self‑regulatory or supervisory authority having appropriate jurisdiction over
such Person in  connection with routine regulatory examinations), (iv)
information that is or becomes generally available to the public other than as
a result of an act or omission of Seller or its Affiliates or as a result of a
breach of obligations of  confidentiality owed by another Person to the
Company or Buyer, or (v) disclosures by Seller in connection with a proceeding
to enforce its rights against the Company or Buyer for a breach arising under
this Agreement.

 

 

(e) Seller shall direct its officers and directors not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) make any negative statement or communication regarding Buyer,
the Company or any of  their respective Affiliates or employees with the
intent to harm any such Person, or (ii) make any derogatory or disparaging
statement or communication regarding Buyer, the Company, or any of their
respective Affiliates or employees; provided, that,  for clarification, no
such Person shall be prevented or otherwise discouraged from making true and
accurate statements or communications in connection with any disclosure that
such

 

 

 

56  

Person reasonably believes is required pursuant to Law or necessary to enforce
any rights of Seller or its Affiliates under this Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement.

 

 

(f) The covenants set forth in this _Section 7.22_ (the " _Restrictive
Covenants_ ") are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of Buyer
and its  Affiliates and their respective trade secrets and confidential
information and businesses and each and every one of the Restrictive Covenants
is reasonable with respect to subject matter, length of time and geographic
area, and has a unique, very  substantial and immeasurable value to Buyer and
its Affiliates. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in
any state that any of the Restrictive Covenants is excessive in duration or
scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under  applicable Law, it is the
intention of Seller and Buyer that such restriction may be modified or amended
by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the
Laws of that state or other jurisdiction. Whenever possible, each  provision
of this _Section 7.22_ will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective
and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision of this _Section 7.22_ is
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any 
applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability will not affect any other provision or any other
jurisdiction, but this _Section 7.22_ will be reformed, construed and enforced
in such jurisdiction as if such  invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
had never been contained herein. In the event of any violation of Restrictive
Covenants by a Seller, the applicable Restrictive Covenants will be extended
by a period of time equal to the period of such  violation, it being the
intention of the parties hereto that the running of the applicable restriction
period will be tolled during any period of such violation.

 

 

7.23 _Release._

 

 

(a) In consideration for the Purchase Price, as of and following the Closing
Date, Seller (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) knowingly, voluntarily
and unconditionally releases, forever  discharges, and covenants not to sue
Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company) from or for any and all
claims, causes of action, demands, suits, debts, obligations, liabilities,
damages, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) of  every
kind or nature whatsoever, known or unknown, actual or potential, suspected or
unsuspected, fixed or contingent, that Seller has or may have, now or in the
future, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from any act or omission,
error,  negligence, breach of contract, tort, violation of law, matter or
cause whatsoever from the period of time prior to the Closing Date and
relating to the operation of the Business, the ownership of the Membership
Interests and the ownership of the  Transferred Assets, as applicable;
provided, however, that the foregoing release will not apply to any claims
arising out of this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement.

 

 

(b) Seller (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby expressly agrees
that the release contemplated by this _Section 7.23_ extends to any and all
rights granted  under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code or any
analogous state law or federal law or regulation are hereby expressly waived.
Section 1542 of the California Civil Code (" _Section 1542_ ") reads as
follows:

 

 

 

57  

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING
PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF
EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND  THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE
MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY."

 

 

Seller understands that Section 1542, or a comparable statute, rule,
regulation or order of another jurisdiction, gives such party the right not to
release existing claims of which such party is not  aware, unless such party
voluntarily chooses to waive this right. Having been so apprised, Seller (on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates) nevertheless hereby voluntarily elects to
and does waive the rights described in Section 1542, or such other 
comparable statute, rule, regulation or order, and elects to assume all risks
for claims that exist, existed or may hereafter exist in its favor, known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, arising out of or related to claims or
other matters  purported to be released pursuant to this _Section 7.23_ , in
each case, effective upon the Closing Date. Seller (on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates) acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waiver is an
essential and material term of  this Agreement and that, without such waiver,
Buyer would not have agreed to the terms of this Agreement. Seller (on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates) hereby represents to Buyer that it understands
and acknowledges that it may hereafter discover  facts and legal theories
concerning Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company) and the subject
matter hereof in addition to or different from those which it now believes to
be true. Seller understands and hereby agrees that the release set  forth
herein shall remain effective in all respects notwithstanding those additional
or different facts and legal theories or the discovery of those additional or
different facts or legal theories. Seller (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates)  assumes the risk of any mistake of fact or applicable law with
regard to any potential claim or with regard to any of the facts that are now
unknown to it relating thereto.

 

 

7.24 _DCSA Approval_. Each party hereto agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts, as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event no
later than  Closing, to obtain DCSA Approval of the terms of the FOCI
mitigation approach required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

 

7.25 _Nondisclosure and Proprietary Rights Agreements_. The Company will use
commercially reasonably efforts prior to the Closing Date to obtain from the
employees of the Company and/or Garlock (Related to the Business), as
applicable,  listed on _Schedule 7.25_ , executed Nondisclosure and
Proprietary Rights Agreements in substantially the form attached hereto on
_Schedule 7.25_.

 

 

7.26 _Valuation Report_. At least five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall furnish to Buyer (i) a valuation report from Seller's 
third party actuary determining the amount of any unfunded liabilities under
the Fairbanks Morse Engine Retiree Premium Reimbursement Account Plan accrued
through December 31, 2019; _provided_ that for active Business Employees such
liability  shall be prorated based on service through December 31, 2019 as
compared to all service through the Business Employee's assumed post-Closing
retirement date (such amount, the " _OPEB Amount_ " and such report, the "
_Valuation Report_ ") and  (ii) a report from

 

 

 

58  

Seller's third party actuary determining the appropriate reserve for workers'
compensation claims of the Business through December 31, 2019 (such amount,
the " _Workers ' Comp Reserve_" and such report the " _Workers '     
Comp Report_"). The calculations in the Valuation Report shall be updated for
all periods up through December 31, 2019, in accordance with U.S. generally
applicable accounting principles applicable to the post-retirement benefits
other than  pensions and consistent with the assumptions set forth in the
notes to the Seller's 2018 financial statements updated to reflect current
market conditions. Buyer shall be entitled to review, and Seller shall
consider in good faith any modifications  to the Valuation Report and the
Workers' Comp Report proposed by Buyer; _provided_ , that, subject to the
foregoing good faith consideration and the calculation's compliance with the
methodology set forth herein, the Valuation Report and the  Workers' Comp
Report and the calculations and amounts set forth thereon shall be determined
by Seller and Seller's third party actuary in its sole discretion. Seller, the
Company, and their respective Representatives shall cooperate with and make 
available to Buyer and its Representatives all information, records, data and
working papers, and shall permit access to their respective personnel involved
in the preparation or review of the Valuation Report and Workers' Comp Report
during normal  business hours, as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation and analysis of the Valuation Report and Workers' Comp
Report and the resolution of any disputes related thereto; _provided,_ that
Seller's and the Company's  actuaries will not be obligated to make any work
papers available to any Person except in accordance with such actuary's normal
disclosure procedures and then only after such Person has signed a customary
agreement relating to such access to work  papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such actuary and neither Seller nor the Company will
be obligated to provide any information, records, data and working papers to
the extent disclosure of such items would cause such party to lose  the
attorney-client privilege with respect thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that
if a party is withholding any information pursuant to the foregoing exception
it shall notify the other parties and, describe the information being so 
withheld and, if requested, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
extracts or summaries of such protected information or otherwise provide such
protected information in a manner that would not jeopardize the applicable
privilege.

(a) (i) The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Article IV_ and Seller set forth in _Article V_ (other than the Fundamental 
Representations set forth therein) must be true and correct in all respects
(without giving effect to any materiality or material adverse effect
qualifications contained therein) as of the Closing Date as though made on and
as of the Closing Date  (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier
date, in which case as of such date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (ii) the  Fundamental
Representations of the Company set forth in _Article IV_ and Seller set forth
in _Article V_ shall be true and correct in all respects (without giving
effect to any materiality or material adverse effect qualifications 
contained therein) as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the
Closing Date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such date), in each case, other than de minimis 
inaccuracies.

 

 

(b) The Company and Seller must have performed in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by them under this Agreement at or prior
to the Closing Date.

Buyer hereunder.

 

 

8.3 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. No party hereto may rely on the
failure of any condition set forth in _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_, as the
case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such party's breach

ARTICLE IX

 

TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

 

 

9.1 _Termination_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this
Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

 

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

 

 

(b) by Buyer or Seller, upon written notice to the other, if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have not been consummated on or prior to April
10, 2020, or such later date, if  any, as Buyer and Seller agree upon in
writing (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_ is not available
to any party whose breach of any  provision of this Agreement results in or
causes the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated by the Termination Date;

 

 

(c) by Buyer or Seller, upon written notice to the other, if a Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction and residing in a jurisdiction in which
the Company does  business has issued an Order or any other action
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and

 

 

 

61  

such Order has become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section  9.1(c)_ is
not available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement
results in or causes such Order or other action;

 

 

(d) by Seller, if (i) Buyer has breached or failed to perform any of its
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied with
by Buyer, such that  the closing condition set forth in _Section 8.1(b)_
would not be satisfied or (ii) there exists a breach of any representation or
warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement such that the closing condition
set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_   would not be satisfied, and in the case of
both (i) and (ii) above, such breach or failure to perform is not cured within
30 days after receipt of written notice thereof or is incapable of being cured
by Buyer by the Termination Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller is
not then in material breach of this Agreement; or

 

 

(e) by Buyer, if (i) the Company or Seller has breached or failed to perform
any of their covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement to be
complied with by  them such that the closing condition set forth in _Section
8.2(b)_ would not be satisfied or (ii) there exists a breach of any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement such
that the closing condition set forth in _Section      8.2(a)_ would not
be satisfied, and in the case of both (i) and (ii) above, such breach or
failure to perform is not cured within 30 days after receipt of written notice
thereof or is incapable of being cured by the Company or Seller by the 
Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer is not then in material
breach of this Agreement.

 

 

Either party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
9.1_ (other than _Section 9.1(a)_ ) shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party and no such termination shall  be effective
unless and until written notice of such termination is so delivered;
_provided_ that in the case of a termination by Seller, no such termination
shall be effective until the fifth Business Day following the delivery of
written  notice thereof to Buyer and such termination shall not be effective
if prior to such date Buyer delivers written notice to Seller that it is
ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and does so consummate the
Closing (unless the failure to  so consummate the Closing is due to non-
performance by Seller of its obligations under this Agreement).

 


 

 

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1_ by either Buyer or Seller, this  Agreement will
become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the
part of Buyer or Seller other than the provisions of _Section 7.2(b)_ ,
_Section 7.2(c)_ , _Section 7.3_ , this _Section 9.2_ , and _Article     
XI_ , which will survive any termination of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein will relieve any party from any liability for
any pre-termination willful breach knowingly committed by such party of its
covenants  or agreements set forth in this Agreement; provided further,
however notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Debt
Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the  Financing Commitments or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination.

 

 

 

62  

ARTICLE X

 

REMEDIES

 

 

10.1 _Survival_. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of
Seller, the Company and Buyer contained in this Agreement  (including the
Schedules and exhibits attached hereto and the certificates delivered pursuant
hereto) will survive the Closing but only to the extent specified in this
_Section 10.1_.

 

 

(a) All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement (including the
Schedules and exhibits attached to this Agreement and the certificates
delivered pursuant to this  Agreement) and the Closing Transfer Documents
that contemplate performance thereof following the Closing will survive the
Closing in accordance with their respective terms and the covenants in Section
7.1, and _Section 7.9_ hereof will survive  the Closing until the one year
anniversary of the Closing Date (such applicable date of expiration, the "
_Covenant Expiration Date_ "); provided, however, that Seller's liability for
a breach of Section 7.1 hereof shall not exceed $3,375,000.

 

 

(b) The Fundamental Representations contained in this Agreement will survive
the Closing Date until the 6-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "
_Representation  Expiration Date_ ").

 

 

(c) The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, other than
the Fundamental Representations, shall not surviving the Closing Date.

 

 

(d) Any Claim pending on the Representation Expiration Date or the Covenant
Expiration Date, as applicable, for which a Notice has been given in
accordance with _Section  11.5_ on or before the Representation Expiration
Date or the Covenant Expiration Date, as applicable, may continue to be
asserted and indemnified against until finally resolved, regardless of any
statute of limitations or limitation set forth in  this _Section 10.1_. Any
Claim brought by an Indemnitee after the Representation Expiration Date or
Covenant Expiration Date, as applicable, will be void and invalid; _provided_
that nothing in this Agreement shall limit any claim with  respect to Fraud,
which shall survive the Closing indefinitely.

 

 

10.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its successors, permitted assigns  and
Affiliates, and their respective officers, employees, directors, managers,
members, partners, stockholders, heirs and other Representatives
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all
Losses actually sustained,  incurred or paid by any of the Seller Indemnitees
following the Closing as a result of (a) any breach of a Fundamental
Representation of Buyer contained in this Agreement (including any related
Schedule or any certificates delivered by Buyer pursuant  to this Agreement);
(b) except for claims with respect to which Seller is obligated to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 10.3_ , any Assumed Liabilities and
(c) any breach of the covenants or agreements of Buyer or Canadian  Buyer
contained in this Agreement or the Closing Transfer Documents.

 

 

 

63  

10.3 _Indemnification by Seller_. From and after the Closing, Seller shall
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its successors, permitted assigns  and
Affiliates, and their respective officers, employees, directors, managers,
members, partners, stockholders, heirs and other Representatives
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all
Losses actually sustained,  incurred or paid by any of the Buyer Indemnitees
following the Closing as a result of (a) any breach of a Fundamental
Representation of Seller or the Company contained in _Article IV_ or _Article
V_ of this Agreement (including any  related Schedule or any certificates
delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement); (b) any Excluded Liabilities,
and (c) any breach of the covenants or agreements of the Company prior to the
Closing or of Seller or Garlock contained in this  Agreement, the Pre-Closing
Transfer Documents or Closing Transfer Documents.

 

 

10.4 _Exclusive Remedy_. The parties agree that, from and after the Closing,
the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties hereto for any Losses  based
upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of the matters set forth in this
Agreement (including the Pre-Closing Transfer Documents, the Closing Transfer
Documents and the other Schedules and the certificates delivered pursuant
hereto) or the  transactions contemplated hereby (other than for claims of,
or causes of action arising from, Fraud or the matters described in _Section
2.5_ ) are the indemnification obligations of the parties set forth in this
_Article X_. The  provisions of this _Section 10.4_ will not, however,
prevent or limit a cause of action (a) under _Section 11.11_ to obtain an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and  provisions hereof, or (b) under _Section 2.5_ and
_Section 2.6_ to enforce any decision or determination of the Arbitration
Firm.

 

 

10.5 _Limitations; Other Qualifications_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the rights of the Indemnitees are 
qualified as follows:

 

 

(a) The Buyer Indemnitees' sole source of payment or indemnification for any
claims under this Agreement shall be (i) first, from the RandW Policy (to the
extent covered  thereby) and (ii) second, from Seller; _provided_ , _however_
, that if the Buyer Indemnitees obtain recovery from the RandW Policy for
matters subject to indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.3_ and, because of
such recovery,  such Buyer Indemnitees' recovery under the RandW Policy with
respect to a claim of breach of a representation and warranty by Seller or the
Company that is not a Fundamental Representation is reduced, then Seller shall
promptly pay to the Buyer  Indemnitees the amount of such reduction.

 

 

(b) Other than with respect to claims of, or causes of action arising from,
Fraud by Seller or the Company, the aggregate liability of Seller for all
indemnification under  _Section 10.3_ shall not exceed the Purchase Price.

 

 

(c) Other than with respect to claims of, or causes of action arising from,
Fraud by Buyer, the aggregate liability of Buyer for all indemnification under
_Section 10.2_ shall not exceed  the Purchase Price.

 

 

(d) The Seller Indemnitees' and the Buyer Indemnitees' right to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2_ and _Section 10.3_ , respectively,
will be reduced by the amount of  insurance or indemnification proceeds or
other amounts actually recovered from other sources (net of any fees, costs
and expenses related to the recovery

 

 

 

64  

of such payment, including deductibles, retrospective premium adjustments,
experience-based premium adjustments and indemnification obligations) by the
Seller Indemnitees or the Buyer Indemnitees, as  the case may be, following
its commercially reasonable efforts with respect to the settlement or
resolution of a Claim for which the Seller Indemnitees or the Buyer
Indemnitees, as the case may be, were entitled to indemnification hereunder,
and any  such amounts actually received by the Seller Indemnitees or the
Buyer Indemnitees, as the case may be, following the payment of an
indemnification claim under this Article X shall be remitted to Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be, promptly following  receipt thereof. Buyer will
not permit the RandW Policy to be terminated, nor to be amended or modified in a
manner adverse to Seller, nor will Buyer waive or permit  to be waived any
right under the RandW Policy in a manner adverse to Seller. Buyer shall cause
the RandW Policy to expressly exclude rights of subrogation against Seller,
other than rights of subrogation against Seller with respect to claims of, 
or causes of action arising from, Fraud.

 

 

(e) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.3_ to the extent such amount was actually included in the
calculation of  the Purchase Price. The Buyer Indemnitees' right to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.3_ on account of any Losses will be
reduced by the amount of any reserve specifically reflected on the Company's
books and records as of the Closing  Date. No Indemnitee shall be entitled to
be compensated more than once for the same Loss.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no Seller Indemnitee shall be
entitled to make any claim for indemnification pursuant to the Company's
certificate or  organizational documents, or any insurance policy maintained
by Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates in respect of any
claim made against any Seller Indemnitee by a Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to
this _Article X_.

 

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, all
of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or in the
certificates  delivered pursuant to _Sections 3.1(f)_ - _(i)_ that are
qualified as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" or any words of
similar import shall be deemed to have been made without any such
qualification for purposes of determining  (i) the amount of damages
resulting from, arising out of or relating to any breach of a representation
or warranty and (ii) whether any such breach has occurred; _provided_ , that,
for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not apply to the  use of
"Material" in the defined terms "Material Contract", "Material Customer" and
"Material Supplier".

 

 

10.6 _Procedures_.

 


 

 

(a) _Notice of Losses by Seller Indemnitee_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after a Seller Indemnitee has knowledge of any claim or potential claim that
it has  under this _Article X_ that may result in a Loss (a " _Seller Claim_
"), and in any event within 15 days after discovery of such Seller Claim by a
Seller Indemnitee, Seller shall give written notice of such Seller Claim (a "
_Seller Claims  Notice_ ") to Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release Buyer from any of its
obligations under this _Article X_ except to the extent Buyer is actually and
materially prejudiced by  such failure. A Seller Claims Notice must describe
the Seller Claim in reasonable detail (to the extent

 

 

 

65  

known), and indicate the amount (estimated, as necessary and to the extent
feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the applicable
Seller Indemnitee; _provided_ that the Seller  Indemnitee shall have the
right to update any Seller Claims Notice as and when additional facts and
circumstances arise relating to the underlying Seller Claim.

 

 

(b) _Notice of Losses by Buyer Indemnitee_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after a Buyer Indemnitee has knowledge of any claim or potential claim that it
has  under this _Article X_ that may result in a Loss (a " _Buyer Claim_ "
and together with a Seller Claim, a " _Claim_ "), and in any event within 15
days after discover of such Buyer Claim, the Buyer  Indemnitee shall give
written notice of such Buyer Claim to Seller (a " _Buyer Claims Notice_ " and,
together with a Seller Claims Notice, a " _Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that the failure to provide such notice shall not  release Seller from any
of its obligations under this _Article X_ except to the extent Seller is
actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. A Buyer Claims Notice must
describe the Buyer Claim in reasonable detail (to the extent  known), and
indicate the amount (estimated, as necessary and to the extent feasible) of
the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the applicable Buyer Indemnitee;
_provided_ that the Buyer Indemnitee shall have the right to update any
Buyer  Claims Notice as and when additional facts and circumstances arise
relating to the underlying Buyer Claim.

 

 

(c) _Opportunity to Defend Third Party Claims_. In the event of any Claim by a
third party against a Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as applicable,
for which  indemnification is available hereunder, Buyer or Seller, as
applicable (each an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), has the right, exercisable by
written notice to Buyer or Seller, as applicable, within 60 days of receipt of
a Notice from the applicable  Indemnifying Party (but not the obligation) to
assume and conduct the defense of such Claim with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party first agrees in
writing to indemnify the Indemnitee for any  Losses that may arise therefrom,
disregarding the limitations set forth herein; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense or
control of a Claim if (A) such Claim seeks an order,  injunction or other
equitable relief against the Indemnitee or the Company, (B) such Claim
involves any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation, (C) counsel to the Indemnitee reasonably determines that a
conflict of  interest exists on a material issue with respect to such defense
or control, (D) the resolution of such Claim would reasonably be expected to
have the effect of increasing the Tax liability of an Indemnitee or the
Company for any Tax period (or  portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date, or (E) such claim involves a customer, supplier, or other material
business relation of the Indemnitee. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed
such defense as provided in this _Section 10.6(c)_ ,  except as otherwise
provided in this _Section 10.6(c)_ , the Indemnifying Party will not be liable
for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnitee in connection
with the defense of such Claim and the Indemnifying Party shall allow  the
Indemnitee a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such
Claim with its own counsel. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the
defense of any such Claim in accordance with this _Section 10.6(c)_ , the
Indemnifying Party  may still participate in, but not control, the defense of
such Claim at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party will lose its right to
contest, defend, litigate and  settle the Claim if it fails to promptly
accept a tender of the defense of the Claim or thereafter at all relevant
times conduct a good faith

 

 

 

66  

and diligent defense of such Claim, and in such event, the Indemnitee will
have the right to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the
defense, compromise or settlement of any such  Claim, subject to the
limitations in _Section 10.6(d)_ , and to recover its legal costs and expenses
in connection therewith from the Indemnifying Party. In any such Claim, the
party responsible for the defense of such Claim (the "
_Responsible       Party_ ") shall, to the extent reasonably requested
by the other party, keep such other party informed as to the status of such
Claim, including all settlement negotiations and offers. Seller or Buyer, as
the case may be, shall, and shall cause  each of its Affiliates and
Representatives to, cooperate with the Responsible Party in the defense of any
third party Claim.

 

 

(d) _Settlement_. The Indemnifying Party shall be authorized to consent to a
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any third party
Claim, without  the consent of any Indemnitee, _provided_ , that (A) the
Indemnifying Party shall (i) give the Indemnitee written notice of the
Indemnifying Party's intention to settle any such Claim at least 30 days prior
to the settlement of any such Claim,  (ii) pay all amounts arising out of
such settlement or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness of such
settlement and (iii) obtain, as a condition of any settlement or other
resolution, a complete release of any Indemnitee potentially affected  by
such third party Claim and (B) the settlement or compromise does not include
or entail (i) the imposition of any consent order, injunction or decree that
would restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnitee or (ii) any
admission of  liability or fault on the part of any Indemnitee. An Indemnitee
may settle or consent to the entry of any judgment arising from any third
party Claim, without the consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or  delayed); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the Indemnifying Party has not consented to such settlement or
judgment, then the existence or amount of such settlement or judgment shall
not be dispositive on the Indemnifying Party's obligation,  if any, to
indemnify the Indemnitee in respect thereof or the amount of any payment to
which the Indemnitee may be entitled hereunder in respect thereof.

 

 

10.7 _Mitigation_. Nothing herein waives the common law duty of an Indemnitee
to mitigate any Losses with respect to which it is seeking  indemnification
hereunder.

 

 

10.8 _Adjustment to Purchase Price; Manner of Payment_. All indemnification
payments made pursuant to this _Article X_ will be treated as  an adjustment
to the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by Law. Except for any
indemnification payments that are permitted to be offset pursuant to _Section
11.11_ , any indemnification payments to be made by pursuant to this
_Article  X_ shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party in cash by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by the
Indemnitee within 5 Business Days after the final determination thereof.

11.10      _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_.

 

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement and subject to
_Section 11.10(b)_ or _(c)_ below, (i) any Action seeking to enforce any
provision  of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and any Action for
recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof shall be
brought, tried and determined in the  Delaware Court of Chancery or, if

the United States located in the State of Delaware or, if jurisdiction is
unavailable in the courts of the United States located in the  State of

property to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate
appellate  courts therefrom) in any such Action, (B) irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement of this  Agreement and the other agreements or
documents executed and delivered in connection herewith or any dispute or
controversy related to the transactions contemplated hereby, that they are not
subject thereto or  that such Action may not be brought or is not

by such courts or that their property is exempt or immune from execution, that
the Action is brought in an inconvenient  forum, or that the venue of the

may be made upon any party by mailing a copy thereof by registered or
certified mail, postage prepaid, to such party at its address as provided in
_Section_ _11.5_.

 

 

(b) If, and only if, the Delaware Court of Chancery, the courts of the United
States located in the State of  Delaware or the Delaware Superior Court would
not have jurisdiction over all or any portion of an Action based upon, arising
out of or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby (all or such portion of any such Action  so declined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery, the courts of the United States located in the State of
Delaware and the Delaware Superior Court, an " _Arbitration Action_ "), the
parties hereto agree that the Arbitration Action will be finally  settled by
binding arbitration in accordance with the then effective Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association by a panel of 3
arbitrators mutually agreeable to the parties. If the parties cannot mutually
agree upon the  selection, the arbitrators shall be selected in accordance
with the rules of the then effective Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association. To the extent not governed by such rules,
such arbitrators shall be directed by  the parties hereto to set a schedule
for determination of such dispute, claim or controversy that is reasonable
under the circumstances. Such arbitrators shall be directed by the parties to
determine the dispute in accordance with this Agreement  and the substantive
rules of law (but not the rules of procedure or evidence) that would be
applied by a federal court required to apply the internal law (and not the law
of conflicts) of the State of Delaware. The arbitration will be conducted in 
the English language in New York City, New York. Judgment upon the award
rendered by the arbitrators may be entered by any court having jurisdiction.

any party  from seeking interim injunctive relief in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, the courts of the United States located in the State of Delaware or
the Delaware Superior Court to prevent irreparable injury pending appointment
of the arbitrators pursuant  to this _Section 11.10(b)_.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of the parties to
this Agreement agrees that it will not bring or support any Person in any
Action of any kind  or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, but not  limited to, any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal
and New York state courts located in the Borough of  Manhattan within the
City of New York.

 

 

11.11       _Enforcement of Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement was
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was  otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that at any time prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of
_Section 9.1_ the parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to  prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled hereunder, at law or in equity. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing,  any party shall be entitled to set-off any
amounts payable by it under any of the Transaction Agreements to the other
party or its Affiliates against any amount otherwise payable to it or its
Affiliates by such other party or its Affiliates under  any of the
Transaction Agreements.

 

 

 

71  

11.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY  CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY  LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST OR INVOLVING ANY DEBT
FINANCING SOURCE ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE  DEBT FINANCING). EACH
PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY HERETO WOULD NOT, IN  THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY HERETO UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY HERETO MAKES THIS
WAIVER  VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH PARTY HERETO HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION_ _11.12_.

 

 

11.13 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or  unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any  provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision will be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

 

11.14 _Construction_. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If any ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be  construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement. The words "include," "includes" or 
"including" (or any other tense or variation of the word "include") in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."
When reference is made in this Agreement to an Annex, Article, Section,
Exhibit or Schedule,  such reference shall be to an Annex, Article, Section,
Exhibit or Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in
this Agreement, shall refer to this  Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The phrase "to the extent" means the
degree or measure to which a subject or other item extends and shall not
simply mean "if." The phrase "made available" (or words of  similar import),
when used in this Agreement, shall mean that the information referred to has
been physically or electronically delivered to Buyer prior to the date of this
Agreement in the data room in unredacted form and is accessible to Buyer at 
least two Business Days prior to the date hereof and any information provided
separately to Buyer's counsel over email with a subject line of "Documents to
Review (1 of 2)" or "Documents to Review (2 of 2)" or via federal express to
Boyd Greene on  an "outside counsel only" basis because of the competitively
sensitive nature of such information, as a result of NOFORN restrictions or
otherwise. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable

 

 

 

72  

to the singular as well as to the plural forms of such terms and to the
masculine as well as the feminine and neuter genders of such terms.

 

 

11.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including counterparts transmitted in .pdf or similar format or
any electronic signature complying with the ESIGN Act of 2000,  e.g.,
www.docusign.com), each of which will be deemed an original but all of which
will constitute but one instrument.

 

 

11.16 _Representation of Seller and its Affiliates_. Buyer agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnitees, that, following the Closing,
Robinson, Bradshaw and Hinson, P.A. (" _RBH_ "),  Foley and Lardner LLP ("
_Foley_ ") and McMillan LLP ( together with RBH and Foley, " _Seller Counsel_
") may serve as counsel to Seller and its Affiliates in connection with any
matters related to this Agreement and the transactions  contemplated hereby,
including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
notwithstanding any representation by Seller Counsel prior to the Closing of
the  Company. Buyer and the Company hereby (a) waive any claim they have or
may have that Seller Counsel has a conflict of interest or is otherwise
prohibited from engaging in such representation and (b) agree that, in the
event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer or the Company, on
the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, Seller
Counsel may represent Seller or any of  its Affiliates in such dispute even
though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Buyer or the
Company and even though Seller Counsel may have represented the Company in a
matter substantially related to such dispute. Buyer  represents that Buyer's
own attorney has explained and helped Buyer evaluate the implications and
risks of waiving the right to assert a future conflict against Seller Counsel,
and Buyer's consent with respect to this waiver is fully informed.   Buyer
and the Company also further agree that, as to all privileged communications
among Seller Counsel and the Company and Seller or any of Seller's Affiliates
and representatives, to the extent related to the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement and arising prior to the Closing, the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller and may
be controlled by Seller and will not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the
Company. In addition, all of  the client files and records in the possession
of Seller Counsel to the extent related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby will continue to be property of (and be controlled by)
Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the  event that a dispute arises
between Buyer or the Company, on the one hand, and a third party other than a
party to this Agreement, on the other hand, after the Closing, the Company may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of  confidential
communications by Seller Counsel to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company may not waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of Seller.

 

 

11.17 _No Recourse Against Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything
to the  contrary contained in this Agreement, the Parties hereby agree that
none of the Debt Financing Sources shall have any liability to the Seller or
any of its Affiliates or any other Person (other than the Buyer and its
permitted assigns in respect of  the Debt Commitment Letter) relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Financing Commitments), whether at law or
equity, in contract or in tort or otherwise, and neither the Seller nor any of
its Affiliates or any other Person (other than  the Buyer and its permitted
assigns in respect of the Debt Commitment Letter) shall have any rights or
claims against any of the Debt Financing Sources under this Agreement or the
Financing Commitments, whether at law or equity, in contract or in  tort, or
otherwise.
