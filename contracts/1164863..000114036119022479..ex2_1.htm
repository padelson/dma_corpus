        Foley &amp; Lardner LLP (&#8220;<u>Foley</u>&#8221;) and McMillan LLP ( together with RBH and Foley, &#8220;<u>Seller Counsel</u>&#8221;) may serve as counsel to Seller and its Affiliates in connection with any matters related to this Agreement and the transactions

        Company.&#160; Buyer and the Company hereby <a name="DocXTextRef351"></a>(a) waive any claim they have or may have that Seller Counsel has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation and <a name="DocXTextRef352"></a>(b) agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer or the Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, Seller Counsel may represent Seller or any of
        its Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Buyer or the Company and even though Seller Counsel may have represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute.&#160; Buyer
        represents that Buyer&#8217;s own attorney has explained and helped Buyer evaluate the implications and risks of waiving the right to assert a future conflict against Seller Counsel, and Buyer&#8217;s consent with respect to this waiver is fully informed.&#160;
        Buyer and the Company also further agree that, as to all privileged communications among Seller Counsel and the Company and Seller or any of Seller&#8217;s Affiliates and representatives, to the extent related to the transactions contemplated by this
        Agreement and arising prior to the Closing, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller and may be controlled by Seller and will not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the Company.&#160; In addition, all of
        the client files and records in the possession of Seller Counsel to the extent related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will continue to be property of (and be controlled by) Seller.&#160; Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
        event that a dispute arises between Buyer or the Company, on the one hand, and a third party other than a party to this Agreement, on the other hand, after the Closing, the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
        confidential communications by Seller Counsel to such third party; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that the Company may not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of Seller.</div>
