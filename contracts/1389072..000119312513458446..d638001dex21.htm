applicable award agreements, or pursuant to action taken by the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) to so accelerate such Company Option (other
than acceleration contemplated by this _Section 2.12(a)_), to vest in full
and become Company Vested Options (as defined below) immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any
Company Option, each Company Option that was outstanding and vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including each Company Option that
vests in accordance with _Section 2.12(a)_ and that was not exercised
prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Vested Option_ "), shall be
automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation from and after the date as of which such Company Vested
Option becomes a Participating Company Option, (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying such Company Vested Option, _multiplied_ by
(ii) the Per-Share Consideration Amount, if any, in accordance with _Section
2.16_, payable to the holder thereof in Parent Shares or cash as provided for
in _Section 2.16_. The cancelation and conversion of Company Vested Options
in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed an
assumption and substitution of such Company Vested Options within the meaning
of Section 11(b) of the Award Plan.

(c) The amounts payable in respect of each Company Vested Option pursuant to
this _Section 2.12_ shall be paid without interest and less applicable
withholding taxes.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, after the Effective Time, no Company Option

a letter, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Securityholder Representative, (i) describing the treatment of and payment for
such Company Vested Option pursuant to this _Section 2.12_, (ii) directing
each such holder of a Company Vested Option to comply with the terms of
_Section 5.1_ ( _Public Announcements_ ), and (iii) providing instructions
for use in obtaining payment therefor, which instructions will require each
holder thereof, as a condition to receiving any payment pursuant to this
Agreement in respect of such Company Vested Option, to enter into an agreement
on terms and conditions substantially similar to the Letter of Transmittal,
including provisions to the effect that (A) each such holder shall, upon
execution of such agreement, be deemed to have appointed the Securityholder
Representative as its representative, and (B) the terms of _Section 5.1_ (
_Public Announcements_ ) and _Article VI_ shall be deemed to bind such holder
as if it were a signatory hereto.

 



21 Section 2.13 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and who demands
properly in writing appraisal for such shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock in accordance with, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as "
_Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to
such shares), shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive,
the consideration payable in respect of such shares in accordance with
_Section 2.8(a)_ and _Section 2.9(a)_, as applicable, but instead such
holder of Dissenting Shares shall instead be entitled only to receive payment
of the appraised value of such shares of Company Stock in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, _except_ the right to receive the
appraised value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Dissenting Shares held by
any such holder who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall
have withdrawn or otherwise lost its rights to appraisal of such Dissenting
Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall have determined that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided
by Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been
automatically converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, and shall
represent only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect of
such shares in accordance with _Section 2.8(a)_ and _Section 2.9(a)_, as
applicable, without any interest thereon, upon surrender in the manner
provided in _Section 2.14_ and the right of such holder to payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease.

Section 2.14 _Payments at Closing and Exchange Procedures Generally_.

(a) _Payments at Closing_. Parent, the Company and the Securityholder
Representative shall appoint the Paying Agent to act as paying agent for the
payment of the Closing Payment, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Acquisition
Expenses and, if applicable, any Milestone Payment and/or Revenue Payment, in
accordance with this  _Article II_ and, in connection therewith, shall
promptly enter into that certain Paying Agency Agreement with the Paying Agent
in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Paying
Agency Agreement_ "). The Company has delivered to Parent, and Parent shall
promptly deliver to the Paying Agent, the Closing Statement and a spreadsheet
setting forth the calculation of the payments to be made to each individual
Company Securityholder pursuant to this _Section 2.14(a)_. At or promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent shall have deposited (x) the Closing Payment
into an account with the Paying Agent (the " _Payment Fund_ ") for
the benefit of the Company Securityholders (other than holders of Dissenting
Shares and shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.9(b)_) that
are entitled to receive a portion of the Closing Payment pursuant to this 
_Section 2.14_ and to fund the Management Sale Bonus Plan pursuant to the
terms thereof at Closing, and (y) the Cash Amount into an account with the
Paying Agent to pay the Closing Date Indebtedness and the Acquisition
Expenses (excluding amounts required to be funded under the Management Sale
Bonus Plan in connection with the Closing, and any Closing Date Indebtedness
and Acquisition Expenses that Parent has elected to repay directly). Parent
shall, or Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Securityholder
Representative shall cause the Paying Agent to:

 



22 (i) from the Cash Amount, repay the Closing Date Indebtedness (as set forth in
the Closing Statement) on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiary in full
pursuant to the Payoff Letters;

(ii) from the Cash Amount, pay the Acquisition Expenses (as set forth in the
Closing Statement), other than amounts required to be funded under the
Management Sale Bonus Plan in connection with the Closing, on behalf of the
Company and its Subsidiary and the Company Securityholders in full (and, for
the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall fund from the Cash Amount the portion of
the Management Sale Bonus Plan payable in cash that is required to be funded
under its terms in connection with the Closing, which payment shall be
made in accordance with the Companys standard payroll practices and not made
through the Paying Agent);

(iii) from the Closing Payment, fund the portion of the Management Sale Bonus
Plan payable in Parent Shares that is required to be funded under its terms in
connection with the Closing; and

 

(iv) distribute the remaining amount of the Closing Payment to the Closing
Consideration Preferred Recipients, such that each such Person receives (in
Parent Shares, valued using the Parent Share Closing Price) the portion of the
Liquidation Preference Amount that such Person is entitled to receive in the
Merger in respect of its shares of Company Preferred Stock pursuant to and
in accordance with the Company Organizational Documents and the Company
Funding Documents (it being understood that the amounts distributed pursuant
to this _Section 2.14(a)(iv)_ shall not be sufficient to satisfy the full
Liquidation Preference Amount).

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent, the Securityholder Representative, and the Surviving Corporation
shall or shall cause, or shall instruct the Paying Agent to, deliver to each
Company Stockholder and Company Preferred Stock Warrant Holder a notice
advising each such Company Stockholder or Company Preferred Stock Warrant
Holder of the occurrence of the Closing and the procedure for surrendering to
the Paying Agent any certificates representing Company Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") or Warrants, and directing each such Company Stockholder or
Company Preferred Stock Warrant Holder to comply with the terms of _Section
5.1_ ( _Public Announcements_ ) hereof, in each case together with a letter of
transmittal in substantially the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit D_ (each,
a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). If such Company Stockholder or Company
Preferred Stock Warrant Holder has complied with the foregoing, then such
Company Stockholder or Company Preferred Stock Warrant Holder shall be paid
on or promptly after the Closing Date or the applicable Milestone Payment Date
or Revenue Payment Date, the amount, without interest, that such Company
Stockholder or Company Preferred Stock Warrant Holder is entitled to receive
in respect of the shares of Company Preferred Stock or Company Preferred
Stock Warrants evidenced by such Certificates and Warrants pursuant to
_Section 2.8(a)_, _Section 2.9(a)_, _Section 2.10_, _Section 2.14_ and 
_Section 2.16_ (as and when due hereunder) and the Certificates and Warrants
so surrendered shall immediately be canceled. If a Company Stockholder or
Company Preferred Stock Warrant Holder has not delivered an executed Letter
of Transmittal, together with its Certificates and Warrants, by the Closing
Date or the applicable Milestone Payment Date or Revenue Payment Date, then
such Company Stockholder or Company Preferred Stock Warrant Holder shall be
paid promptly after the Paying

 



23  Agent receives such documents, the amount, without interest, that such
Company Stockholder or Company Preferred Stock Warrant Holder is entitled to
receive in respect of the shares of Company Preferred Stock or Company
Preferred Stock Warrants evidenced by such Certificates and Warrants pursuant
to _Section 2.8(a)_, _Section 2.9(a)_, _Section 2.10_, _Section 2.14_ and
_Section 2.16_ (as and when due hereunder), and the Certificates and
Warrants so surrendered shall immediately be canceled. Until so surrendered,
any outstanding Certificates and Warrants held by a Company Stockholder or
Company Preferred Stock Warrant Holder shall be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to
receive the amounts specified by _Section 2.8(a)_, _Section 2.9(a)_,
_Section 2.10_, _Section 2.14_ and  _Section 2.16_ (as and when due
hereunder) and payable in respect of the shares of Company Stock or Company
Preferred Stock Warrants evidenced by such Certificates and Warrants in
accordance with such provisions.

 

(c) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates and Warrants_. In the event that
any Certificate or Warrant shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying Agent shall, on behalf of Parent, pay, from amounts deposited by Parent
with the Paying Agent, the amounts specified by _Section 2.8(a)_, _Section
2.9(a)_, _Section 2.10_, _Section 2.14_ and _Section 2.16_ (as and when
due hereunder) in respect of the shares of Company Stock or Company Preferred
Stock Warrants evidenced by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate or
Warrant, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof;
_provided_ , that Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition
precedent to payment, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate or Warrant to provide an agreement of indemnification or the
posting of a bond, in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent as
indemnification against any claim that may be made against Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificate or
Warrant alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If the payment of the consideration payable in
respect of shares of Company Stock or Company Preferred Stock Warrants in
accordance with _Section 2.8(a)_, _Section 2.9(a)_, _Section 2.10_,
_Section 2.14_ and _Section 2.16_ (as and when due hereunder), as
applicable, is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificates or Warrants surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, then
it shall be a condition of payment that (i) the Certificates and Warrants so
surrendered are properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and (ii) the Person requesting such payment has (A) paid to Parent or the
Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
such consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificates or Warrants surrendered, or (B) established to the satisfaction
of Parent or the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

 

(e) _Withholding for Payment of Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct
and withhold under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent and paid to
the proper Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable Tax Law, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the

 



24  case may be, shall (i) give written notice to each such Person of any such
withholding, and (ii) promptly provide any such Person with any additional
documentation required for such Persons Tax filings that may be reasonably
requested by such Person.

(f) _Termination of Payment Fund; No Liability_. Subject to the second
sentence of this _Section 2.14(f)_, any portion of the Payment Fund that
constitutes the Closing Payment or any Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment
and that remains undistributed to the Company Securityholders or
to participants in the Management Sale Bonus Plan (A) in the case of the
Closing Payment, as of the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time and (B)
in the case of any Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, as of the six-month
anniversary of the applicable Milestone Payment Date or Revenue Payment Date,
shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any Company Securityholder
(other than a holder of Dissenting Shares and shares to be canceled in
accordance with  _Section 2.8(b)_ and _Section 2.9(b)_, as applicable), who
has not complied with this _Section 2.14_ shall be entitled to look to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws) only as
general creditors thereof with respect to any consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates and Warrants held by them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Company Securityholder for any
consideration delivered to a public official in accordance with any abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Law.

 

(g) _No Further Ownership Rights_. Payment of the consideration pursuant to
_Sections 2.8_, _2.9_ , _2.10_ ,  _2.12_ , and _2.16_ (in each case, as
applicable), shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Company Securities and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of the
Company Securities which were outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Warrants are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this _Section 2.14_.

(h) _Fractional Amounts_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this _Article II_, (i) in lieu of the issuance of any fractional Parent
Share in respect of the consideration payable to the Company Securityholders
pursuant to this _Article II_, Parent shall pay (either via the Paying Agent
or through payroll of Parent or the Surviving Corporation) to any Company
Securityholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive such fractional
Parent Share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by
_multiplying_ (A) the Parent Share Closing Price or the applicable Parent
Share Contingent Payment Price, as the case may be, by (B) such fraction of a
Parent Share (rounded to the nearest thousandth) that such individual
would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article II_. To the
extent any such fractional shares are being held by the Paying Agent, the
parties shall cause the Paying Agent to return such fractional shares to
Parent, and (ii) any amounts that Parent shall pay (either via the Paying
Agent or through payroll of Parent or the Surviving Corporation) to any
Company Securityholder in cash pursuant to this _Article II_ shall be rounded
to the nearest cent. 

Section 2.15 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and

Payment_ ") equal to 12.5% of Sales made within the Contingent Payment Period
during the preceding calendar year, to be paid in Parent Shares or cash (or
any combination of Parent Shares or cash), such allocation in Parents sole
and absolute discretion, in accordance with  _Section 2.16(c)_; _provided_ ,
that for all Sales of Products that do not use a Synergy System, the Revenue
Payment shall be reduced to 10% of Sales made within the Contingent Payment
Period during the preceding calendar year. Each of the Company and the
Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Securityholders)
acknowledges and agrees that the achievement of the conditions for the Revenue
Payments is dependent on Regulatory Approvals, market factors and
other circumstances and that Parent and the Surviving Corporation may not
achieve such conditions, and it is therefore not assured that Parent will be
required to pay any Revenue Payments.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parents
obligation to pay Revenue Payments shall terminate upon the aggregate payment
of $75,000,000 in Revenue Payments (the " _Revenue Cap_ ") to Company

, _further_ , that (B) in the event that Parent makes a Milestone Payment to
the Company Securityholders in accordance with _Section 2.16(a)(iii)_ in

27  as a Milestone Payment in accordance with _Section 2.16(a)(iv)_ has not
become due and payable by Parent to the Company Securityholders.

circumstances shall the aggregate amount of Revenue Payments exceed

(c) _Contingent Payment Mechanics_.

 

(i) Not less than two Business Days prior to any applicable Milestone Payment
Date or Revenue Payment Date, the Securityholder Representative shall deliver
to Parent and the Paying Agent a spreadsheet setting forth the calculation of
the payments to be made to each individual Company Securityholder and
participant in the Management Sale Bonus Plan pursuant to this  _Section
2.16(c)_. At or prior to any applicable Milestone Payment Date or Revenue
Payment Date, Parent shall deposit, as applicable, (A) an amount of Parent
Shares equal to (1) the applicable Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment,
_divided_ by (2) the Parent Share Contingent Payment Price or (B) an amount of
cash equal to the applicable Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment into an
account with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Company Securityholders
(other than holders of Dissenting Shares and shares canceled in accordance
with _Section 2.8(b)_ or _Section 2.9(b)_) (or any combination of Parent
Shares or cash, such allocation in Parents sole and absolute discretion).
Any Parent Shares to be delivered to Company Securityholders pursuant to this
_Section 2.16_ shall be valued using the applicable Parent Share Contingent
Payment Price. Beginning on the date hereof through the expiration of the
Contingent Payment Period, if any change in the outstanding shares of capital
stock of Parent shall occur, by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or similar transaction in the period of time during which the Parent
Share Contingent Payment Price is being calculated or after the Parent Share
Contingent Payment Price has been calculated but before the related Milestone
Payment or Revenue Payment is made, then the calculations set forth above
shall be adjusted in an equitable manner to appropriately account for such
change. From such proceeds, on the Milestone Payment Date or the Revenue
Payment Date (or as promptly thereafter as practicable), Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall, subject to _Section 2.16(c)_, cause the
Paying Agent to distribute the Milestone Payment or the Revenue Payment, as
applicable, among the Company Securityholders (other than holders of
Dissenting Shares and shares canceled in accordance with _Section 2.8(b)_ or
_Section 2.9(b)_) in the following manner ( _provided_ , _that_ , Parent may
elect to make any payments to be made pursuant to this  _Section 2.16_ to
Company Vested Optionholders in respect of Company Vested Options in
accordance with the Companys standard payroll practices, which may or may not
be effected through the Paying Agent):

 

(A) _first_ , all Milestone Payments and Revenue Payments, as applicable,
shall be paid to Company Preferred Stockholders until each has received
(taking into account the payments made pursuant to _Section 2.14(a)(iv)_ the
full portion

 



28  of the Liquidation Preference Amount that each such Company Preferred
Stockholder is entitled to receive in the Merger in respect of its shares of
Company Preferred Stock pursuant to and in accordance with the Company
Organizational Documents and the Company Funding Documents; and

(B) _second_ , to the extent that any portion of a Milestone Payment or
Revenue Payment remains, as reduced in accordance with _Section 2.16(h)_, an
amount equal to the aggregate Per-Share Consideration Amount payable to
Company Securityholders as a result of such Milestone Payment or Revenue
Payment shall be distributed among the Company Securityholders in accordance
with such provisions.

(ii)  _Participating Company Preferred Stock Warrants_. In the event that,
prior to the payment of any Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, as
applicable, the Prior PerPreferred Share Consideration Amount for the series
of Company Preferred Stock into which such Company Preferred Stock Warrant is
convertible is less than the per-share exercise price of the applicable
Company Preferred Stock Warrant for such series of Company Preferred Stock,
but following the payment of such Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, as
applicable, the Prior PerPreferred Share Consideration Amount would, but for
this sentence, exceed such per-share exercise price of such Company Preferred
Stock Warrant, then (i) such Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, as
applicable, shall be distributed to the Company Securityholders in accordance
with _Section 2.16_ only to the extent necessary until the Prior
PerPreferred Share Consideration Amount, inclusive of the portion of such
Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, as applicable, so distributed, equals
the per-share exercise price of such Company Preferred Stock Warrant, (ii) the
Fully Diluted Amount and Per-Share Consideration Amount with respect to
the portion of such Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, as applicable, then
remaining unpaid shall be recalculated taking into account such Company
Preferred Stock Warrant as a Participating Company Preferred Stock Warrant,
and (iii) the portion of such Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, as
applicable, then remaining unpaid shall be distributed to the Company
Securityholders (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the holders of
Participating Company Preferred Stock Warrants) in accordance with _Section
2.16_. For the avoidance of doubt, only Company Preferred Stock Warrants that
are Participating Company Preferred Stock Warrants shall be entitled to
receive any portion of a Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, as applicable,
subject to the provisions of _Section 2.10_, _Section 2.16_ and the related
defined terms.

(iii)  _Participating Company Options_. In the event that, prior to the
payment of any Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, as applicable, the Prior
PerCommon Share Consideration Amount is less than the per-share exercise
price of any Company Vested Option, but following the payment of such
Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, as applicable, the Prior PerCommon
Share Consideration Amount would, but for this sentence, exceed the per-share
exercise price of such Company Vested Option, then (i) such Milestone Payment
or Revenue Payment, as applicable, shall be distributed to the Company
Securityholders in accordance with _Section 2.16_ only to the extent
necessary until the Prior PerCommon Share Consideration Amount, inclusive of
the portion of such Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, as applicable, so
distributed, equals the per-share exercise price of such Company Vested
Option, (ii) the Fully Diluted Amount and Per-Share Consideration Amount with
respect to the portion of such Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, as
applicable, then

 



29  remaining unpaid shall be recalculated taking into account such Company
Vested Option as a Participating Company Option, and (iii) the portion of such
Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, as applicable, then remaining unpaid
shall be distributed to the Company Securityholders (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the holders of Participating Company Options) in
accordance with _Section 2.16_. For the avoidance of doubt, only Company
Vested Options that are Participating Company Options shall be entitled to
receive any portion of a Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment with respect to
such Participating Company Options, as applicable, subject to the provisions
of  _Section 2.12_, _Section 2.16_ and the related defined terms.

(d) _Sales Statements; Information and Access_. 

(i) On or before the date that is thirty (30) Business Days after each
calendar quarter during the Contingent Payment Period, Parent shall prepare
and deliver to the Securityholder Representative a written statement, setting
forth the aggregate amount of Sales (broken down on a month-by-month basis
since the Closing Date) (each, a " _Sales Statement_ ");  _provided_ , that
the first Sales Statement shall only be required to be delivered by Parent to
the Securityholder Representative within thirty (30) Business Days after the
first calendar quarter of 2014; _provided_ , _further_ , that each Sales
Statement that is delivered in connection with the second and fourth calendar
quarters of each calendar year during the Contingent Payment Period shall
include a summary of any material developments or progress (positive or
negative) made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary
of Parent with respect to the Products and the satisfaction of the conditions
of any unpaid Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, which summary shall be no
more than three (3) pages in length and in the form of a memo or presentation
slides. During the Contingent Payment Period, the Securityholder
Representative and its Representatives shall have reasonable access, during
regular business hours and upon reasonable advance written notice, to (A) the
books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and (B) Parents and its
Subsidiaries personnel, in each case, solely to the extent necessary to
assist the Securityholder Representative and its Representatives in
connection with its review of Sales Statements; _provided_ , that the
Securityholder Representative shall only be permitted to exercise such
information and access right once per calendar year in connection with its
and its Representatives review of Sales Statements. The Securityholder
Representative shall, and shall direct any Person who receives any information
pursuant to this _Section 2.16(d)_ to, (x) maintain the confidentiality of
any information delivered to it pursuant to this _Section 2.16(d)_, except
(i) as otherwise required by applicable Law, in which case the Securityholder
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Parent
with advance notice of such requirement and a reasonable opportunity to seek
confidential treatment with respect to such information in advance of any
disclosure of such information by the Securityholder Representative, and (ii)
that the Securityholder Representative may disclose such information, in its
capacity as representative of the Company Securityholders, to any Company
Securityholder who has executed and delivered a confidentiality agreement in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit K_ , and (y) comply with any applicable
securities Laws relating to the possession of material non-public information
and trading.

 

(ii) Beginning in 2014, during each calendar year in the Contingent Payment
Period, the Securityholder Representative shall have the right to participate
in one meeting with representatives of Parent, on a date (between June 1 and
August 31 of such year) and at a location mutually agreed between the
Securityholder Representative and Parent, to 

 



30  review the status of the Products and to discuss any material developments
or progress (positive or negative) made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any other Subsidiary of Parent with respect to the satisfaction of the
conditions to any unpaid Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment.

(e) _Parent Discretion_. Parent shall have sole discretion over all matters
relating to the Products after the Closing, including all matters relating to
the development, manufacturing, commercialization or Regulatory Approval of
the Products after the Closing (including in respect of the decision to
pursue any of the foregoing, and, if applicable, the timing thereof) and to
the allocation of personnel and other resources reasonably available to Parent
and its Subsidiaries.

 

(f) _Parent Covenants_.

 

(i) During the Contingent Payment Period, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its other Subsidiaries to, use its or their
commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions to the Milestone
Payments and the Revenue Payments, taking into account available resources,
integration activities and relative likelihood of technical, regulatory and
commercial success; _provided_ , that the parties hereto hereby agree that
the expenditure by Parent and/or its Subsidiaries of at least $40,000,000
incurred for research and development and clinical trial activities relating
to the Products and with the sale and marketing of the Products during the
Contingent Payment Period in respect of its obligations to satisfy the
conditions to the Milestone Payments and the Revenue Payments in this _Section
2.16(f)_ shall be deemed to constitute commercially reasonable efforts for
purposes of this _Section 2.16(f)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that such
expenditure shall not be the exclusive means deemed to constitute commercially
reasonable efforts for purposes of this  _Section 2.16(f)_.

(ii) For purposes of _Section 2.16(f)(i)_:

 

(A) research and development and clinical trial activities shall include all
direct expenses, including labor and materials, and allocable overhead costs
which are allocated in accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent
with Parents internal accounting and reporting treatment;

 

(B) sales and marketing expenses shall include all direct expenses, including
labor and materials, and allocable overhead costs which are allocated in
accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with Parents internal
accounting and reporting treatment; _provided_ , _further_ , that sales and
marketing expenses which are common to or shared by multiple products sold by
Parent, including the Products (" _Indirect Sales and Marketing Expenses_ "),

(2) total Parent revenue; and

(C) overhead costs refers to expenses, other than direct expenses, which
are incurred and generally allocated to departments on the basis of square
footage, fixed assets utilized, or headcount; _provided_ , that for purposes
of this _Section 2.16(f)(ii)(C)_, overhead costs shall be limited to 15% of
direct expenses.

 



31 (g) _Tax Treatment_. The parties hereto agree to treat any Milestone Payment
and Revenue Payment as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax and
financial reporting purposes.

(h) _Reduction of Acquisition Expenses and Unilateral Right of Set-Off_.

(i) In the event that any Acquisition Expenses remain outstanding prior to,
or become payable in connection with, the payment of a Milestone Payment or
Revenue Payment, the amount of such Acquisition Expenses shall be deducted
from the amounts otherwise payable to the Company Securityholders under this
_Section 2.16_. If any such Acquisition Expenses constitute payments to third
parties, Parent will promptly pay the applicable amount to such third party
following receipt of payment information. For the avoidance of doubt,
all Milestone Payments and Revenue Payments to be made to the Company
Securityholders under this _Section 2.16_ shall, prior to the payment of any
amounts to the Company Securityholders, be reduced by amounts required to be
paid to participants under the Management Sale Bonus Plan in connection with
such Milestone Payments and Revenue Payments, which amounts shall be paid to
such participants in the same form ( _i.e._ , cash and/or Parent Shares) as
the related Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, which payments Parent may
elect to make in accordance with the Companys standard payroll practices and
which payments may or may not be effected through the Paying Agent.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
obligation of Parent to make any Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment, as
applicable, shall be qualified in its entirety by the right of Parent to
reduce the amount of such Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment by the
aggregate amount of Damages claimed in good faith by the Parent Indemnified
Parties pursuant to  _Article VI_ and (A) not fully resolved prior to such
Milestone Payment Date or Revenue Payment Date, as applicable, or (B)
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be payable to the Parent
Indemnified Parties.

 

(i) _Other Terms_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
obligation of Parent to make any Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment (and to
pay any amounts in connection therewith to participants in the Management Sale
Bonus Plan) shall begin on the Closing Date and terminate on the eighth (8th)
anniversary of the Closing Date (including the extension provided in the
proviso to this clause (i), the " _Contingent Payment Period_ "); _provided_ ,
that the obligation of Parent to make the Milestone Payment pursuant to
_Section 2.16(a)(v)_ (and to pay any amounts in connection therewith to

Date and terminate on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Closing Date.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, under no
circumstances shall the aggregate amount of (A) the Merger Consideration and
(B) the Cash Amount exceed $350,000,000.

 



32 (iii) In the event that a third party (other than a third party that is an
Affiliate of Parent prior to such transaction) acquires 50% or more of
Parents capital stock or assets (whether by the purchase of Parents assets
or stock, merger or otherwise) during the Contingent Payment Period and before
the PMA Approval Milestone Payment has become due and payable, then, if an
Interventional System to be sold in the European Community has been affixed
with a CE Mark, the PMA Approval Milestone Payment shall become due and
payable and shall be paid to the Company Securityholders (and to participants
in the Management Sale Bonus Plan) within five (5) Business Days following the
consummation of such acquisition pursuant to the provisions of _Section
2.16(a)(iii)_. Parent shall ensure that any such acquirer of Parents
business (whether by the purchase of Parents assets or stock, merger or
otherwise) during the Contingent Payment Period shall assume Parents
obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 2.17 _Limitation on Issuances of Parent Shares_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in no event shall
Parent issue pursuant to the terms of this Agreement a number of Parent Shares
that, in the aggregate together with any prior issuances of Parent Shares
hereunder, would exceed 19.9% of the number of Parent Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time unless Parent has first
(at Parents sole option and discretion) obtained the prior approval of its
stockholders in compliance with applicable NASDAQ (or any subsequent exchange
or trading market in which the Parent Shares have their primary listing at
the applicable time) listing rules. In the event that there is a payment due
to Company Securityholders hereunder and Parent may not, as a result of the
prior sentence, issue some or all of the Parent Shares that would otherwise
be issued in connection therewith, Parent shall pay the applicable portion of
such payment in cash (and each applicable Company Securityholder will receive
the cash equivalent of the Parent Shares (valued at the Closing Date or the
applicable Milestone Payment Date or Revenue Payment Date, using the Parent
Share Closing Price or the applicable Parent Share Contingent Payment Price)
that would otherwise have been payable).

adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with
the past custom and practice of the Company and its Subsidiary. Since the date

43  period and no request for any such waiver or extension is currently pending.
No power of attorney that is currently in force has been granted with respect
to any matter relating to Taxes that could affect the Surviving Corporation
or its Subsidiary after the Closing Date. Neither the Company nor its
Subsidiary has applied for a ruling relating to Taxes which will be binding on
the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiary, Parent or any Affiliate of Parent
after the Closing Date or entered into a closing or similar agreement with any
Governmental Authority.

(f) The Company and its Subsidiary have, or have caused to be, duly and
timely withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authorities all
material Taxes required to be so withheld and paid over for all periods under

Person as a result of having been a member of any consolidated, combined,
affiliated or unitary group prior to the Closing Date, as a transferee or
successor or pursuant to any contractual agreement entered into prior to the
Closing Date. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiary is a party to any
agreement or arrangement providing for the allocation or sharing of Taxes,
and after the Closing Date, neither the Surviving Corporation nor its
Subsidiary will be bound by any such agreement or similar arrangement entered
into prior to the Closing Date or have any liability thereunder for any
amounts due in respect of periods prior to the Closing Date.

(j) The Company was not a distributing corporation or a controlled
corporation in a transaction intended to be governed by Section 355 of the
Code at any time during the two-year period ending on the date hereof.

include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable
income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing
Date as a result of any installment sale or open transaction disposition made
prior to the Closing Date. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiary is required,
or has agreed, to make any adjustment related to a change in accounting
method for Tax purposes.

(l) The Company has made available complete copies of (i) all federal, state,
provincial, local and foreign income or franchise Tax Returns of the Company
and its Subsidiary relating to the taxable periods ending on or after December
31, 2010, and (ii) any audit report issued within the last three years
relating to any Taxes due from or with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiary.

(m)  _Section 3.13(m)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all income or
franchise Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiary filed after December
31, 2008 and indicates for each such Tax Return the filing jurisdiction,
filing date, whether such Tax Return

 



44  has been audited by the relevant Governmental Authority, and whether the
statute of limitations remains open for such Tax Return.

 

(n) Except with respect to the last sentence of _Section 3.13(e)_, _Section
3.13(i)_, and _Section 3.13(k)_, no representation or warranty contained in
this _Section 3.13_ shall be deemed to apply directly or indirectly with
respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) after the Closing Date.

 

(o) The Company and its Subsidiary are in material compliance with all terms
and conditions of any Tax exemptions, Tax benefit programs or other
preferential Tax treatments. No submissions made to any Governmental Authority
in connection with obtaining any Tax exemption, Tax benefit or other
preferential Tax treatment contained any misstatement or omission that would
have materially affected the granting of such Tax exemption, Tax benefit or
other preferential Tax treatment. No suspension, revocation or cancellation of
any such Tax exemption, Tax benefit or other preferential Tax treatment is
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing. The
Transactions will not have any material and adverse effect on the continued
validity and effectiveness of any such Tax exemptions, Tax benefit programs or
other preferential Tax treatments, and will not result in the claw-back or
recapture of any material Tax exemptions, Tax benefits or other preferential
Tax treatments previously obtained by the Company or its Subsidiary.

 

Section 3.14 _Properties_.

 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiary each has good and valid title to, free and
clear of all Liens, or holds pursuant to valid and enforceable leases, all of
the tangible personal property and assets (excluding Intellectual Property)

Section 5.2 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

Party_ " and, collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against any Damages incurred by such Company Indemnified Party by reason of:
(i) any act or omission or alleged act or omission performed or omitted to be
performed on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiary or otherwise in
connection with the business of the Company or its Subsidiary; or (ii) the
fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiary, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL (it being understood
that the DGCL requires that a Company Indemnified Party must have acted in
good faith and in a manner such Person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Company and

 



56  its Subsidiary, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful), indemnification

hereof, and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,

that the provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation allowing for the indemnification of the Company

Parties shall not be amended in a manner that would limit the scope of such
indemnification and insurance. For the avoidance of doubt, this  _Section

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall purchase a "tail" insurance policy
comparable to the Companys and its Subsidiarys current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the Company
Indemnified Parties that shall provide such Company Indemnified Parties with
coverage for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, with
reputable and financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous in
the aggregate than the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiary with respect to claims
arising from or related to facts or events that occurred at or before the
Effective Time; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation
be required to expend an annual amount in excess of 200% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance coverage.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.2_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and each
party entitled to insurance coverage under this _Section 5.2_, respectively,
and his or her heirs and legal representatives, who shall be deemed third

Surviving Corporation complies with all of its obligations under this _Section
5.2_ and Parent hereby guarantees all such obligations of the Surviving
Corporation under this _Section 5.2_.

successors or assigns) (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
its properties and assets to any Person, then Parent shall cause
proper provisions to be made such that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.2_.

 

Section 5.3 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, until the completion of the
benefits open enrollment period that will be offered to employees of Parent

57  Corporation to provide individuals who are employed by the Company and its
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Employees_ ") with
(i) salaries, wages and bonus opportunities that are, in the aggregate, at
least as favorable as those provided to the Employees by the Company and its
Subsidiary as of the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits that are, in
the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided to the Employees by
the Company and its Subsidiary as of the Effective Time. Nothing in this
_Section 5.3_, whether express or implied, shall in any way provide or confer
upon any Person any third-party beneficiary rights, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period or continued
participation in any benefit plan, by reason of this _Section 5.3_, or limit
Parents or the Surviving Corporations or any of their respective
Subsidiaries rights to terminate any Employee for any reason at any time.
Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor each Benefit Plan and each written contract between the
Company or its Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any director, officer or
employee of, or consultant or independent contractor to, the Company or its
Subsidiary, on the other hand, that is set forth in the Company Disclosure
Letter in accordance with its respective terms as of the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 5.3_ or this

Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to modify, amend or
terminate any Benefit Plan or contract referred to in the preceding sentence
in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) Following the Effective Time, for all purposes under the benefit plans,
programs, policies, and arrangements of Parent and its Affiliates and to the
same extent recognized by the Company and its Subsidiary prior to the

by the Company and its Subsidiary (including service with any predecessor
employer for which the Company or its Subsidiary credited service but not for
benefit accruals) under the Benefit Plans prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to
duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit.

(c) With respect to any welfare benefit plans maintained by Parent or its
Affiliates for the benefit of the Employees, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or another Subsidiary of Parent to, (i) waive, or use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause insurance carriers to waive, all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Employees
(and their covered dependents) but, unless otherwise required by applicable
Law, only to the same extent recognized by the Company or its Subsidiary
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) in determining any deductible, out-of-
pocket limitations or similar requirements under healthcare plans, give credit
towards satisfying any applicable deductible or similar requirements for the
applicable plan year in which the Effective Time occurs with respect to an
amount equal to the excess of (A) the total expenses paid by any Employee
during the portion of the applicable plan year prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to all Benefit Plans that are healthcare plans, _over_ (B) the
amount of any employer- or plan-funded credits toward such expenses with
respect to similar plans maintained by the Company or its Subsidiary prior to
the Effective Time.

 

(d) As of immediately prior to the Closing Date (but conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Closing), the Company shall have terminated the CircuLite,

Documents or the Company Preferred Stock Warrants. Any such notice will comply
with the requirements of applicable Law.

 

Section 5.5 _Payoff Letters; Release of Liens_. Contemporaneously with the
repayment of the Closing Date Indebtedness pursuant to  _Section
2.14(a)(i)_, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent a
payoff letter executed by each lender of Closing Date Indebtedness (or, if
applicable, the administrative or other agent in respect of any
applicable credit facility), effective as of the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Payoff Letters_ "), which shall provide for, among other
things, the release, discharge, removal and termination of all Liens on the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiary arising under any applicable credit
facility and related agreements upon payment of the amounts set forth therein.

Subsidiaries to preserve and keep, books and records held by the Company or
its Subsidiary relating to the Company Securityholders that are required to be
retained under current written retention policies for a period of five years
from the Closing Date, during which time Parent shall make such books and
records available to the Securityholder Representative as the Securityholder
Representative may reasonably require in order to facilitate the resolution of
any claims made against or incurred by any Company Securityholders relating
to the business of the Company and its Subsidiary conducted prior to Closing.
Parent may destroy such books and records after such time, but only after
Parent gives 30 days prior written notice to the Securityholder
Representative and details the contents of such books and records to be

Securityholders) shall have the option to take possession of such books and
records at its own expense within 30 days of the date of such notice by
Parent.

Section 5.7 _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Company has delivered to Parent a
certificate or certificates in compliance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2 and reasonably satisfactory to Parent, certifying that the
Transactions are exempt from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code;
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Parents sole right if the Company has failed to provide such certificate or
certificates shall be to make an appropriate withholding under Section 897
and 1445 of the Code.

agreement, the Person executing the waiver has agreed to waive all of his or

Indemnifying Parties, severally (and not jointly and severally) in accordance
with its Pro Rata Portion, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, and their respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees and Representatives (each, a " _Parent
Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ")
from and against any Damages incurred by any Parent Indemnified Party to the
extent arising out of or resulting from (without duplication): (a) any breach
of any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement;

Agreement; (c) any inaccuracy in the amount of Acquisition Expenses or Closing
Date Indebtedness set forth in the Closing Statement; (d) any shares of

Company Securityholder that the Merger Consideration payable to such Person
was calculated incorrectly under, or otherwise inconsistent with, the terms of
the Company Funding Documents, the Company Organizational Documents, or any
other applicable agreement.

Section 6.2 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. The obligation of the Company
Indemnifying Parties to indemnify any Parent Indemnified Party under this
_Article VI_ with respect to Damages arising out of or resulting from third
party claims (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") shall be subject to the following
terms and conditions:

 

(a) A Parent Indemnified Party shall give the Securityholder Representative
prompt written notice of any such Third Party Claim (a " _Third Party Claim
Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such prompt
written notice shall not release the Company Indemnifying Parties from their
indemnification obligations except to the extent, and only to the extent, the
Company Indemnifying Parties are prejudiced by such failure. The
Securityholder Representative may undertake and assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim (on the behalf of the Company Indemnifying Parties) within
30 days of receiving such Third Party Claim Notice with representatives
chosen by it. During such 30-day period, the Parent Indemnified Party may make
such filings, including motions for continuance (and answers if a motion for
continuance has not been granted), as may be necessary to preserve the
parties positions and rights with respect to such Third Party Claim (and the
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of one counsel to the Parent
Indemnified Party in connection therewith shall be considered "Damages" for
purposes of this Agreement). If the Securityholder Representative undertakes
the defense of a Third Party Claim, then (i) the Parent Indemnified Party may
retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense but shall not be
entitled to any reimbursement with respect thereto ( _provided_ , that if, in
the reasonable opinion of counsel to the

 



61  Parent Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to the
Parent Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those
available to the Securityholder Representative or (B) there exists a conflict
of interest between the Securityholder Representative or any Company
Indemnifying Parties, on the one hand, and the Parent Indemnified Party, on
the other hand, that cannot be waived, the Company Indemnifying Parties shall
be liable for (as "Damages" hereunder) the reasonable and documented fees and
expenses of one separate counsel to the Parent Indemnified Party), (ii) the
Securityholder Representative shall keep the Parent Indemnified Party advised
of the status of the Third Party Claim and the defense thereof, and (iii) the
Securityholder Representative shall reasonably consider recommendations made
by the Parent Indemnified Party with respect thereto.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.2_, the
Securityholder Representative shall not be entitled to assume or conduct, and
the Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the
defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim if (i) such Third Party Claim
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal Action involving the
Parent Indemnified Party; or (ii) if the amount equal to (A) (x) the Damages
that Parent, in good faith reasonably expects to be incurred in connection
with such claim _minus_ (y) the maximum amount that such Parent Indemnified
Party could then be entitled to recover under the applicable provisions of
this _Article VI_, _minus_ (B) the maximum amount that such Parent
Indemnified Party could then be entitled to recover under the applicable
provisions of this _Article VI_ is greater than zero.

(c) If the Securityholder Representative does not assume control of the
defense within 30 days after written notice of any such Third Party Claim or
thereafter fails or ceases to defend such Third Party Claim, then (i) the
Parent Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake and control
the defense of such Third Party Claim upon further advance written notice of
five Business Days, (ii) the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of
counsel to the Parent Indemnified Party in connection therewith shall be
considered "Damages" for purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for the
Parent Indemnified Party with respect to a single Third Party Claim or a
series of related Third Party Claims be considered "Damages" for purposes of
this Agreement, and (iii) the Company Indemnifying Parties and the
Securityholder Representative shall thereafter have no right to undertake the
defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.2_ to the contrary, (i)
the Securityholder Representative shall not, without the written consent of
the Parent Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent
to the entry of any judgment unless such settlement or judgment (x) includes
the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Parent Indemnified Party of
an unconditional release from all liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim and (y) does not involve a finding or admission of wrongdoing on the
part of the Parent Indemnified Party or impose an injunction or other
equitable relief upon the Parent Indemnified Party, and (ii) the Parent
Indemnified Party shall not, without the written consent of the
Securityholder Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent
to the entry of any judgment 

 



62  which does not include the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the
Company Indemnifying Parties of an unconditional release from all liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim.

 

(e) The parties hereto shall act in good faith in responding to, defending
against, settling or otherwise dealing with any Third Party Claims, and
cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access during
normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all information
relevant thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
party controlling the defense of any Third Party Claim shall (to the extent
not inconsistent with the protection of attorney-client or other applicable
privilege) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the other party, upon
request, copies of all correspondence, pleadings, motions, briefs, appeals or
other written statements relating to or submitted in connection with the
defense of the Third Party Claim, and timely notices of, and the right to
participate (as an observer) in any hearing or other court proceeding,
meeting or negotiation relating to the Third Party Claim.

Section 6.3 _Procedures for Claims Not Involving Third Parties_. A Parent
Indemnified Party wishing to assert a claim for indemnification under this
_Article VI_ that does not involve a Third Party Claim shall deliver a
written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Securityholder Representative,
which shall (a) state in reasonable detail the circumstances giving rise to
the Damages, (b) specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of this Agreement alleged to have been breached or not performed by the
Company (as applicable), (c) specify the estimated amount of the Damages (the
" _Claim Amount_ "), and (d) make a request for any payment then believed due.
The Securityholder Representative may, within 30 days after receipt by the
Securityholder Representative of a Claim Notice, on the behalf of the Company
Indemnifying Parties, deliver to the Parent Indemnified Party a written
response disputing such claim. If no such written response is received by the
Parent Indemnified Party within such 30-day period, then such claim for
indemnification shall be conclusive against the Company Indemnifying Parties.
If the Securityholder Representative in such written response contests the
payment of the Claim Amount, then the Securityholder Representative and the
Parent Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts to arrive at a mutually
acceptable resolution of such dispute within the next 30 days. If a mutually
acceptable resolution cannot be reached between the Parent Indemnified Party
and the Securityholder Representative within such 30-day period, then the
parties may thereupon proceed to pursue any and all available remedies at law
permitted under this Agreement.

 

Section 6.4 _Survival; Limitations on Liability_.

 

(a) _Survival_. The Company Fundamental Representations shall survive the
Closing and continue in full force and effect until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, _plus_ sixty days, at which time they shall
expire. The other representations and warranties of the Company, and the
covenants and agreements of the Company, set forth in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing and continue until the date that is 18 months
following the Closing Date, at which time they shall expire. The
representations and warranties of the Parent and Merger Sub, shall expire at
the Closing.

 



63 (b) _Cap; Deductible_.

 

(i) The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Damages payable by the
Company Indemnifying Parties under _Section 6.1(a)_ (excluding any
indemnifiable Damages payable by the Company Indemnifying Parties in respect
of the Company Fundamental Representations) in respect of all claims made
thereunder shall not exceed the sum of (A) $3,000,000, _plus_  (B) 10% of the
aggregate Milestone Payments and Revenue Payments (each such Milestone Payment
and Revenue Payment to be valued at the applicable Parent Share Contingent
Payment Price to the extent paid in Parent Shares) actually made, or due and
payable, to the Company Securityholders pursuant to _Section 2.16_ (the "
_Cap_ ") and in no event shall any Company Indemnifying Party be obligated to
indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties for Damages in respect of such
claims in excess of its Pro Rata Portion of the Cap. For purposes of this
_Article VI,_ "Pro Rata Portion" and "Cap" shall be calculated as of the date
that any indemnification or other payment is to be made and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, a Company Indemnifying Party shall only be
obligated to indemnify a Parent Indemnified Party to the extent it has
actually received Merger Consideration (or such Merger Consideration has been
paid to the Securityholder Representative or has been withheld by Parent
pursuant to _Section 2.16(h)_) pursuant to this Agreement. Any amount of
indemnifiable Damages that would have been payable by the Company Indemnifying
Parties at a given time but for the application of the Cap as in effect at
such time shall become immediately due and payable on the date of any
subsequent increase in the Cap resulting from any Milestone Payment or Revenue
Payment to the extent not restricted by such increased Cap.

(ii) No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for
Damages claimed under  _Section 6.1(a)_ unless and until the aggregate
amount of all Damages incurred by such Parent Indemnified Party in respect of
such claims, taken together, exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), at
which time all such Damages incurred in excess of the Deductible shall be
indemnifiable claims hereunder (subject to all the other terms and conditions
set forth herein); _provided_ , that the limitation set forth in this _Section
6.4(b)(ii)_ shall not apply in respect of any indemnification claims in
respect of breaches of any Company Fundamental Representations or _Section
3.6(a)_ (Company Permits; Compliance With Law; Other Product Matters).

 

(c) _Other Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (i) no Parent Indemnified Party shall make an indemnification
claim hereunder for Damages for which written notice of the underlying claim
was not duly delivered to the Securityholder Representative within the
applicable time limitation set forth in _Section 6.4(a) provided_, 
_however_ , that the failure to deliver such written notice within the
applicable time limitation shall not release the Company Indemnifying Parties
from their indemnification obligations except to the extent, and only to the
extent, the Company Indemnifying Parties are prejudiced by such failure, (ii)
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification for
Damages that are ultimately quantifiable, and (iii) in no event shall the
Company Indemnifying Parties have any liability to a Parent Indemnified Party
for any punitive or special Damages, or Damages measured based on diminution
in value or reputation, of such Parent Indemnified Party ( _except_ , in the
case of clause (iii), to the extent that any of the foregoing Damages are
awarded to a third party against any Parent Indemnified Party in circumstances
in which such Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
hereunder).

 



64  After the Closing, the rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties under this
_Article VI_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parent
Indemnified Parties with respect to claims under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company in this
Agreement shall give rise to any right on the part of any Parent Indemnified
Party, after the Closing, to rescind this Agreement or any of the
Transactions.

Section 6.5 _Mitigation_.

 

(a) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article VI_ shall be reduced by any amounts actually recovered by any
Parent Indemnified Party under any (x) indemnification or other recovery under
any Contract between a Parent Indemnified Party and any third Person and (y)
insurance policies with respect to such indemnification claim, less any
increase in insurance premiums arising therefrom or relating thereto (each
source named in clauses (x) and (y) of this _Section 6.5(a)_, a " _Collateral
Source_ "). A Parent Indemnified Party shall seek full recovery for any
Damages against all Collateral Sources to the same extent as it would if such
Damages were not subject to indemnification hereunder. The Company
Indemnifying Parties shall be subrogated to the rights of the
Parent Indemnified Parties in respect of Damages indemnified by the Company
Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this _Article VI_.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall any Parent Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this _Article VI_ or to make a claim for breach of any other provision of
this Agreement or to any other remedy at Law or in equity to the extent any
Damages were attributable to such Parent Indemnified Partys own fraud or
intentional misconduct. Each Parent Indemnified Party shall, to the extent
practicable and reasonably within its control, take all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages upon and after becoming aware of any
facts, matters, failures or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to
result in any Damages that are indemnifiable hereunder. No indemnification of
the Parent Indemnified Parties will be available hereunder with respect to
Damages directly resulting from actions of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
after the Closing.

 

(c) If a Parent Indemnified Party has received the payment required under this
_Article VI_ from the Company Indemnifying Parties in respect of any Damages
and later receives proceeds from insurance policies or payments from a
Collateral Source in respect of the same Damages, then such Parent Indemnified
Party shall hold such proceeds or other payments in trust for the benefit of
the Company Indemnifying Parties and shall pay to the Securityholder
Representative, within five (5) Business Days after receipt, an amount equal
to the excess of (i) the amount previously received by the Parent Indemnified
Party under this _Article VI_, plus the amount of the insurance payments or
other recoveries from such Collateral Source actually received by such Parent
Indemnified Party, _over_ (ii) the amount of Damages with respect to such
claim which the Parent Indemnified Party has become entitled to receive under
this _Article VI_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it
is the intention of the parties hereto that no Collateral Source shall be (A)
entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of
the foregoing indemnification provisions, or (B) relieved of the
responsibility to pay any claims for which it is obligated.

 



65 Section 6.6 _Calculation of Damages_. Solely for the purposes of calculating
Damages pursuant to this _Article VI_, any limitation as to "materiality" or
"Company Material Adverse Effect" or words of like meaning set forth in such
representation or warranty, except the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in _Section 3.7(b)_ (Company Financial Statements) and
clause (a) of _Section 3.8_ (No Company Material Adverse Effect), shall be
disregarded.

 

Section 6.7 _Securityholder Representative_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the Paying Agency Agreement, the
Registration Rights Agreement, and the other ancillary agreements, documents
and certificates pursuant to such agreements, including all waivers and
amendments to such agreements, documents and certificates (collectively, the "
_Transaction Documents_ "), the Transactions and in any Action involving the
Transaction Documents, each Company Indemnifying Party shall, without any
further action on the part of any such Company Securityholder, be deemed to
have consented to the appointment of the Securityholder Representative as the
representative of such Company Securityholder, as the attorney-in-fact for
and on behalf of each such Company Securityholder in accordance with the terms
of its engagement as the representative of the Company Securityholders, and
the taking by the Securityholder Representative of any and all actions and
the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by them under or
contemplated by the Transaction Documents in each case, as applicable. In
connection therewith, the Securityholder Representative shall have the power
and authority, on behalf of the Company Securityholders, as applicable, to:
(i) execute and deliver the Transaction Documents (it being understood that no
amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by the Company
Stockholders without such further approval), and take all actions required or
permitted to be taken under the Transaction Documents; (ii) agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of and comply with orders
of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such indemnification or
other claims; (iii) act for the Company Indemnifying Parties (regardless of
whether any such Company Indemnifying Party votes in favor of the adoption
and approval of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger) with regard to
all matters pertaining to indemnification pursuant to this _Article VI_,
including the power to compromise any indemnification claim on behalf of the
Company Indemnifying Parties and to transact matters of litigation or other
claims; (iv) give, receive and forward all notices and communications required
to be given or received by the Company Securityholders under the Transaction
Documents and in connection with any of the transactions and other matters
contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Transactions), including
receiving service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement and the Paying Agency Agreement; (v) engage attorneys, accountants,
financial and other advisors and other Persons (including the Paying Agent)
necessary or appropriate (at the expense of the Company Securityholders), in
the sole discretion of the Securityholder Representative in the performance
of its duties under this Agreement, and authorizing and directing the
disbursement of funds to pay the fees and expenses of such Persons (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, by directing the disbursement of a portion of
any Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment payable to the Company
Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement to pay the fees and expenses of
such Persons prior to disbursing the remaining amount of such Milestone
Payment or Revenue Payment to the Company Securityholders); and (vi) take all
actions or refrain from doing any further act or deed on its own behalf or on
behalf of the Company Securityholders that the

 



66  Securityholder Representative deems necessary or appropriate in its
discretion relating to the subject matter of the Transaction Documents, as
fully and completely as the Company Securityholders could do if personally
present. Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability
company, hereby accepts its appointment as the Securityholder Representative.
The Securityholder Representative is authorized by each
Company Securityholder to act on such holders behalf as required under the
Transaction Documents. The Securityholder Representative may resign or be
replaced in accordance with the terms of its engagement as the representative
of the Company Securityholders and the newly appointed Securityholder
Representative shall deliver written notice thereof to Parent and the Paying
Agent (together with reasonable evidence thereof). Such substituted
representative shall be deemed to be the Securityholder Representative for
all purposes of the Transaction Documents. Such removal and appointment shall
be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the written consent or
the date such written consent is received by Parent and the Paying Agent. All
decisions and actions by the Securityholder Representative shall be binding
upon all Company Securityholders, and no Company Securityholders shall have
the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

 

(b) The Securityholder Representative shall act for the Company
Securityholders on all of the matters set forth in the Transaction
Documents in the manner the Securityholder Representative believes to be in
the best interest of the Company Securityholders. The Securityholder
Representative is authorized to act on behalf of the Company Securityholders
notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among the Company
Securityholders. The Securityholder Representative shall be indemnified,
defended and held harmless by the Company Securityholders from and against,
and shall have no liability to the Company Securityholders in respect of, any
and all losses, liabilities, expenses, damages, claims, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses (including the
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel) (collectively, "
_Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the
Securityholder Representatives execution and performance of the Transaction
Documents, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred
absent the Securityholder Representatives or its Affiliates gross
negligence, fraud or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Securityholder Representative by the Company Securityholders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Securityholder Representative
from any Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment at such time as any such amounts
would otherwise be distributable to the Company Securityholders; provided,
that while this _Section 6.7(b)_ allows the Securityholder Representative to
be paid from the Milestone Payments or Revenue Payments, this does not relieve
the Company Securityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent
the Securityholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at
law or otherwise, unless such obligations are otherwise satisfied from such
Milestone Payment or Revenue Payment. The Company Securityholders acknowledge
and agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or
removal of the Securityholder Representative or the termination of this
Agreement.

 

The parties acknowledge that the Securityholder Representatives obligations
under this _Article VI_ are solely as a representative of the Company
Indemnifying Parties, and that the Securityholder Representative shall have no
personal responsibility for any expenses incurred by it in such capacity.

 



67 (c) For all purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) Parent shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions and
decisions of the Securityholder Representative as to the settlement of any
claims for indemnification by any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Article VI_, or any other actions required or permitted to be taken by the
Securityholder Representative hereunder or the Paying Agency Agreement or
in connection with any of the transactions and other matters contemplated
hereby or thereby;

(ii) the provisions of this  _Section 6.7_ are independent and severable,
are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Company Securityholder may
have in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents; and

(iii) the provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall be binding upon the
executors, heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor
trustees and successors of each Company Securityholder, and any references in
the Transaction Documents to a Company Indemnifying Party or a Company
Securityholder shall mean and include the successors to the rights of each
Company Indemnifying Party or Company Securityholder thereunder, whether
pursuant to testamentary disposition, the Laws of descent and distribution or
otherwise.

 

Section 6.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Provisions_. The parties hereto
agree that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall
be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law or a good faith resolution of a
Contest.

 

Section 6.9 _Certain Waivers_. Effective as of the Closing, each Company
Securityholder shall unconditionally and irrevocably waive any claims that
such Company Securityholder, in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company
or as a holder of Company Options or Company Preferred Stock Warrants, has or
may have in the future against the Company or its Subsidiary and releases,
on its own behalf and on behalf of its successors and assigns, the Company,
its Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates, directors and officers, from
any and all Actions with respect thereto, except, in each case, for claims
relating to or arising out of indemnification obligations owed to such
Company Securityholder under applicable Law, this Agreement, indemnification
agreements, the Company Organizational Documents or the Subsidiary
Organizational Documents.

 

Section 6.10 _Conflicts_. To the extent there is a conflict between the
provisions of this _Article VI_ and the provisions set forth in _Article
VII_, the provisions set forth in _Article VII_ shall govern.

 



68 ARTICLE VII

 

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 7.1 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) With respect to Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiary for the Pre-Closing Taxable Period,
Parent shall file or cause to be filed such Tax Returns when due (taking into
account any applicable extensions). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice, _except_ as otherwise required by
applicable Law. Parent shall deliver any such Tax Return to the
Securityholder Representative for its review at least 30 days prior to the
date on which such Tax Return is required to be filed. If the Securityholder
Representative disputes any item on such Tax Return relating to Taxes for
which Parent is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to _Article VI_, then it
shall notify Parent of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its
objection. Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall act in good
faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax
Return is required to be filed. If Parent and the Securityholder
Representative cannot resolve any disputed item, then the item in question
shall be resolved by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the " _Independent
Accountant_ ") or, if such Person is unable or unwilling to act as the
Independent Accountant, such other nationally recognized accounting firm
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Securityholder Representative. The
costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by the
Company Securityholders, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand.

 

(b) The parties hereto shall treat the taxable year of the Company and its
Subsidiary as ending on the Closing Date where required or allowable by
applicable Law and, _except_ as provided under the "next day rule" of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76, shall allocate income to the period ending on
the Closing Date based on a closing of the books as of the Closing Date. The
parties hereto further agree that no ratable allocation election under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or any other similar Law shall
be made with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement on
any Tax Return described in _Section 7.1(a)_. In accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76 and any analogous Law, any Tax related to any
extraordinary transaction that occurs on the Closing Date after the Closing
shall be allocated to the taxable period beginning after the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that, in preparing any Tax Return described in _Section 7.1(a)_,
to the extent permitted by applicable Tax Law, the parties shall treat, and
cause their respective Affiliates to treat, any and all U.S. federal and
state income tax deductions attributable to the Acquisition Expenses payable
at the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.14(a)(ii)_ as allocable to the portion
of the Closing Date that is before the Closing and not as accruing on the day
after the Closing pursuant to the "next day" rule of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or any analogous Law.

 

Section 7.2 _Contest Provisions_.

 

(a) Following the Closing Date, _except_ as provided in _Section 7.2(b)_,
Parent shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own choosing, of any
audit, claim for refund, or administrative or judicial proceeding involving
any asserted Tax liability or refund

 



69  with respect to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiary
(any such audit, claim for refund, or proceeding relating to an asserted Tax
liability being a " _Contest_ ").

(b) Parent shall promptly notify the Securityholder Representative in writing
of receipt by Parent or any of its Affiliates of notice of any pending or
threatened Contest following the Closing Date that relates to Taxes for which
Parent is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to _Article VI_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to provide such prompt written notice shall not
release the Company Indemnifying Parties from their indemnification
obligations except to the extent, and only to the extent, that, but for such
failure, the Tax liability in question could have been avoided. The
Securityholder Representative shall have the right to control the conduct of a
Contest that relates to Taxes for a taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date, but Parent shall have the right to participate in such Contest
at its own expense. The Securityholder Representative shall not be able to
settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest that is
reasonably likely to affect the Tax liability of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiary for which Parent is not entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to _Article VI_ without the reasonable consent of
Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; _provided_ , that if the Securityholder Representative informs
Parent in writing that it chooses not to assume control of the conduct of any
such Contest, then Parent shall assume control of such Contest but shall not
be able to settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest that
is reasonably likely to affect the Tax liability of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiary relating to Taxes for which Parent is entitled
to be indemnified pursuant to _Article VI_ without the reasonable consent of
the Securityholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Parent shall have the right to control the
conduct of any other Contest that relates to Taxes for which Parent is
entitled to be indemnified pursuant to _Article VI_, but the Securityholder
Representative shall have the right to participate in such Contest at its own
expense. Parent shall not be able to settle, compromise and/or concede any
portion of such Contest that is reasonably likely to affect the Tax liability
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiary for which Parent
is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to _Article VI_ without the reasonable
consent of the Securityholder Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Section 7.3 _Termination of Tax Allocation Agreements_. Any and all Tax
allocation or sharing agreements or other agreements or arrangements relating
to Tax matters (" _Tax Sharing Agreements_ ") to which the Company or its
Subsidiary is a party shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, from
and after the Closing Date, neither the Surviving Corporation nor its
Subsidiary shall have any liability thereunder other than any Tax Sharing
Agreements solely among the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiary. 

Section 7.4 _Assistance and Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Securityholder Representative and Parent agree to furnish or cause to
be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information (including access to books and records) and assistance relating to
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiary as is reasonably requested for
the filing of any Tax Returns and the preparation, prosecution, defense
or conduct of any Contest.

 



70 (b) The Securityholder Representative and Parent shall reasonably cooperate
with each other in the conduct of any Contest or other proceeding involving
or otherwise relating to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiary (or their income or assets) with respect to any Tax, and each shall
execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the intent of this _Section 7.4_. Any information
obtained under this _Section 7.4(b)_ shall be kept confidential, _except_ as
may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in
the conduct of a Contest or other Tax proceeding.

(c) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (i) use reasonable
best efforts to properly retain and maintain the Tax and accounting records of
the Company and its Subsidiary that relate to Pre-Closing Taxable Periods for
the applicable statute of limitations for the Taxes in question and shall
hereafter provide the Securityholder Representative with written notice prior
to any destruction, abandonment or disposition of all or any portions of such
records, (ii) transfer such records to the Securityholder Representative upon
its written request prior to any such destruction, abandonment or disposition
and (iii) allow the Securityholder Representative and its Affiliates and their
respective agents and representatives, at times and dates reasonably and
mutually acceptable to the parties, to from time to time inspect and review
such records to the extent relating to the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or its Subsidiary as the Securityholders Representative may deem
necessary or appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , that in all cases, such
activities are to be conducted by the Securityholder Representative during
normal business hours and at the Securityholder Representatives sole expense
_provided_ ,  _further_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that Parent shall not
be required to provide access to any consolidated, combined, affiliated,
unitary or other Tax Return of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, or any Tax
or accounting records related thereto. Any information obtained under this
_Section 7.4(c)_ shall be kept confidential, _except_ as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a
Contest or other Tax proceeding.

 

Section 7.5 _Refunds_.

 

(a) The Company Securityholders will be entitled to any refunds (including
interest received thereon) in respect of any Taxes for which Parent is
entitled to be indemnified pursuant to _Article VI_. Parent shall cause such
refund to be paid to the Securityholder Representative promptly after it is
received. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any Tax refund
(or equivalent benefit to the Company Securityholders through a reduction in
Tax liability) for a period before the Closing Date arising out of the
carryback of a loss or credit incurred by the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiary in a taxable year ending after the Closing Date shall be the
property of Parent and, if received by any Company Securityholder or the
Securityholder Representative, shall be payable promptly to Parent.

 

(b) Except as provided in _Section 7.5(a)_, the Surviving Corporation will be
entitled to any refunds (including any interest received thereon) in respect
of any Tax liability of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiary.

Section 7.6  _Conveyance Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Parent, on the one hand, and the Company Securityholders, on
the other hand,

 



71  shall each be responsible for and shall pay 50% of any sales, use, value
added, transfer, stamp, registration, documentary, excise, real property
transfer, or similar Taxes incurred as a result of the Merger.

ARTICLE VIII

 

FEES, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

Section 8.1 _Fees, Costs and Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section
7.1(a)_, and the second sentence of this  _Section 8.1_, all fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the
Transactions are consummated. Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, all
fees, costs and expenses of the Paying Agent.

Section 8.2 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approvals, but, after
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approvals, no amendment shall be
made which by Law requires further approval by such stockholders without such
further approval. This Agreement may not be amended _except_ by an instrument
in writing signed by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, and the Securityholder
Representative. 

Section 8.3 _Waiver_. By action taken or authorized by such partys board of
directors, or other similar governing body or Person, (a) Parent may (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the Securityholder Representative, Company Securityholders, or the Company
(solely with respect to the Company, for periods prior to the Effective
Time), or (ii) waive compliance with any of the covenants or agreements of the
Securityholder Representative, Company Securityholders, or the Company, (b)
the Securityholder Representative may (i) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(for periods after the Effective Time), or (ii) waive compliance with any of
the covenants or agreements of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and (c)
the Company, prior to the Effective Time, may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent (for periods
prior to the Effective Time), or (ii) waive compliance with any of the
covenants or agreements of Parent (for periods prior to the Effective Time).
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Such extension
or waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for performance,
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any
agreement as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the
extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights.

Section 9.2 _Headings; Table of Contents_. The headings and table of contents
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner 

 



74  materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

 

Section 9.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits
hereto and the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter)
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the
parties, and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and
oral, among the parties or between any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof.

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 9.6 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and,  _except_ as set forth
in _Section 5.2_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

Section 9.7 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to consummate the Transactions, will cause irreparable injury to the
other parties for which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_, the parties shall be entitled,
without posting a bond or similar indemnity, to seek an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court as specified in _Section 9.10_, in addition to any other right or
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Section 9.8 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No
failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. Except as otherwise
explicitly provided for elsewhere herein, all rights and remedies existing
under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive to, and not
exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

 



75 Section 9.9 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
DOMESTIC LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE
OF LAW OR CONFLICTING PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR
ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER
THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE TO BE APPLIED. IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING,
THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WILL CONTROL THE INTERPRETATION AND
CONSTRUCTION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF UNDER SUCH JURISDICTIONS CHOICE OF
LAW OR CONFLICT OF LAW ANALYSIS, THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW OF SOME OTHER
JURISDICTION WOULD ORDINARILY APPLY. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT SUCH PARTY MAY LEGALLY AND
EFFECTIVELY DO SO, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING
HEREUNDER.

 

(b) ANY AND ALL SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ANY OTHER NOTICE IN ANY SUCH CLAIM
SHALL BE EFFECTIVE AGAINST ANY PARTY IF GIVEN PERSONALLY OR BY REGISTERED OR
CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, OR BY ANY OTHER MEANS OF MAIL THAT
REQUIRES A SIGNED RECEIPT, POSTAGE PREPAID, MAILED TO SUCH PARTY AS HEREIN
PROVIDED. NOTHING HEREIN CONTAINED SHALL BE DEEMED TO AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY
PARTY TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL
