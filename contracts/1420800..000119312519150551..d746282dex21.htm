2.7 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the final determination of the Purchase
Price under  _Section_ __ _ 2.13_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.14_ hereunder,
Seller shall allocate for U.S. federal income tax purposes (x) the Purchase
Price (together with any Assumed Liabilities or other items properly treated
as purchase price for U.S. federal income tax purposes) as between the Equity
of each Acquired Company and the Transferred Assets and (y) thereafter, (i)
the aggregate amount allocated to the Equity of the Acquired Companies
among the Equity of each Acquired Company, (ii) the aggregate amount
allocated to the Transferred Assets among the Transferred Assets and (iii) the
aggregate amount allocated to the Equity of any Acquired Company that is a
disregarded entity for US tax purposes or, if applicable, for which the
Section 338(h)(10) Elections may be made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.9_,
shall be further allocated among the assets of such Acquired Company
(together, the " _Proposed Allocation_ "), and Seller shall promptly provide
a copy of the Proposed Allocation to Purchaser. Purchaser shall have a period
of fifteen (15) Business Days after the delivery of the Proposed Allocation
(the " _Response Period_ ") to present in writing to Seller notice of any
objections Purchaser may have to the allocations set forth therein (an "
_Objection Notice_ "). Unless Purchaser timely objects to the Proposed
Allocation within the specified time period, such Proposed Allocation shall
be binding on the parties without further adjustment, absent manifest error.
If Seller fails to provide Purchaser with the Proposed Allocation within
ninety (90) days after the final determination of the Purchase Price,
Purchaser shall have the right to provide Seller with the Proposed Allocation,
with the remaining procedures applying _mutatis mutandis_.

 



23

    

(b) If Purchaser shall raise any objections within the Response
Period, Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use their
reasonable best efforts to resolve such dispute. If the parties fail to agree
within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the Objections Notice, then the
disputed items shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.13_, whose
determination shall be final and binding on the parties. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall use reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute within
thirty days after the item has been referred to it. The costs, fees and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne in the manner
described in _Section_ __ _ 2.14_.

 

(c) The final allocation shall be amended to reflect any purchase price
adjustments hereunder. Seller and Purchaser shall and each shall cause its
Affiliates to (A) report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for
Tax purposes (including Section 1060 of the Code) in accordance with the
allocation (as so amended) as finally determined under this  _Section_ __ _
2.7_ and (B) not take any position inconsistent with such final allocation (as
so amended) on any of their respective Tax Returns unless otherwise required
by a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law) or in connection with the
settlement of any audit or other claim with a Tax Authority.

 

2.8 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted
and withheld under applicable Tax Law. Except for any amounts that are
withheld by reason of the failure to provide the certificate described in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.10(a)(iii)_, if Purchaser believes that any withholding of
Tax is required with respect to any payment under this Agreement, then
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give written notice to
the applicable Seller Entity describing the basis for such withholding in
reasonable detail at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
and Purchaser shall provide such Seller Entity with a reasonable opportunity
to provide any applicable certificate, form or documentation that would
reduce or eliminate the requirement to deduct and withhold Tax with respect to
such payment, and Purchaser shall otherwise cooperate with the applicable
Seller Entity and take such steps as such Seller Entity may reasonably
request to reduce or eliminate such withholding obligation to the extent
permitted by applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_, such deducted and withheld

_Article_ __ _ VIII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature can
only be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of those conditions at that time) are satisfied or waived (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) or at such other place, time or date as
may be mutually agreed upon in writing by Seller and Purchaser. The date on
which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as

 



24

    

 the " _Closing Date._ " Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Marketing
Period has not ended at the time all of the conditions set forth in _Article_
__ _ VIII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be
satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of those conditions at that time) are satisfied or waived (to the extent

by applicable Law) of all of the conditions set forth in  _Article_ __ _
VIII_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at
that time)). Except to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement to
the contrary, and notwithstanding the actual occurrence of the Closing at any
particular time, the Closing shall be deemed to occur and be effective, in the
United States, as of 11:59 p.m. New York time and, in any jurisdiction
outside of the United States, as of the time at which the books of the
Business are normally closed in such jurisdiction, in each case, on the

2.12 _Excess Cash Statement_.

 

(a) Not more than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Initial Excess Cash

have a period of ten (10) calendar days after the delivery of the Initial

without further adjustment, absent manifest error. If Seller 

 



26

    

 shall raise any objections within the Response Period, Purchaser and Seller
shall negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve
such dispute. If the parties fail to agree within ten (10) days after the
delivery of the Objection Notice, then the disputed items shall be resolved by
the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with the procedures set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.13_, whose determination shall be final and binding on the
parties. The Independent Accounting Firm shall use reasonable efforts to
resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) days after the item has been referred
to it. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall
be borne in the manner described in _Section_ __ _ 2.14_. The Excess Cash
Payment Amount as determined after all disputes have been resolved in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.12_ is referred to herein as the "
_Final Excess Cash Payment Amount_ ".

 

(b) Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller (or an Affiliate of
Seller designated by Seller in writing), by wire transfer to an account or
accounts designated by Seller in writing, the amount of the Final Excess Cash
Payment Amount in cash in immediately available funds within ninety (90) days

2.13 _Post-Closing Statements_.

 

(a) Not more than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall

(b) In connection with Sellers review of the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment

Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement and/or its calculation of the
Initial Closing Adjustment Amount and the Excess Cash Amount and Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause its
Representatives to, cooperate reasonably with Seller and its Representatives
in connection therewith.

 

(c) Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the
Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement becomes final and binding, it will
not take or permit to be taken any actions with respect to any accounting
books, records, policies or procedures on which the Initial Post-Closing
Adjustment Statement is based, or on which the Final Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement is to be based, that are inconsistent with the Accounting
Principles.

 



27

    

(d) Seller shall have thirty (30) days (the " _Review Period_ ") following
receipt of the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement to review the Initial
Post-Closing Adjustment Statement and to notify Purchaser in one or more
written notices if it disputes Purchasers calculation of any of the items
set forth on the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement (each, a " _Notice
of Disagreement_ "). If Seller does not deliver a Notice of Disagreement to
Purchaser before the expiration of the Review Period, then effective as of
12:01 a.m., New York City time, on the day immediately following the last day
of the Review Period, the Initial Closing Adjustment Amount shall become
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties and shall constitute the
"Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement" for all purposes of _Section_ __ _
2.13(g)_.

(e) In the event that Seller delivers a Notice of Disagreement to Purchaser
prior to 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on the day immediately following the
last day of the Review Period, (i) the items set forth in the Initial Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement, that are not disputed by Seller pursuant to a
timely delivered Notice of Disagreement shall be final, conclusive and binding
on the Parties for all purposes of the Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement
and (ii) Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the
dispute(s) set forth in one or more Notices of Disagreement (the " _Disputed
Items_ ") as promptly as practicable and, upon such resolution, if any, any
adjustments to the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement and/or the
calculation of the Adjustment Amount shall be made in writing in accordance
with such agreement of Purchaser and Seller. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar
state rule shall apply to any such discussions or communications in
furtherance of negotiations in good faith to resolve any such disputes. If
Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve any such dispute within
thirty (30) days (or such longer period as Seller and Purchaser shall
mutually agree in writing) after Sellers delivery of any Notice of
Disagreement, such dispute shall be promptly submitted to a mutually agreed,
nationally recognized, independent accounting firm (the " _Independent
Accounting Firm_ ").

(f) If any Disputed Items are submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm
for resolution, each of Purchaser and Seller shall submit to the Independent
Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other Party on the same day),
within ten (10) Business Days after the date of the engagement of the
Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum (which may include supporting
exhibits) setting forth their respective positions on the Disputed Items. Each
of Purchaser and Seller may (but shall not be required to) submit to
the Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other Party on
the same day), within thirty (30) days after the date of the engagement of the
Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum responding to the initial memorandum
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm by the other Party. Unless
requested by the Independent Accounting Firm in writing, no Party hereto may
present any additional information or arguments to the Independent Accounting
Firm, either orally or in writing. During the review by the Independent
Accounting Firm, Purchaser and Seller and their respective accountants will
each make available to the Independent Accounting Firm such personnel, and
such information, books and records and work papers and otherwise cooperate
in good faith with the Independent Accounting Firm, as may be reasonably
required by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its obligations under
this _Section_ __ _ 2.13_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the accountants of
Seller or Purchaser shall not be obligated to make any work papers available
to the Independent Accounting Firm, except in accordance with such
accountants normal disclosure procedures and then only after such firm
has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

 



28

    

(g) The Independent Accounting Firm shall, acting as an expert and not as
an arbitrator, calculate, based solely on the written submissions of
Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, and not by
independent investigation, the Adjustment Amount and shall be instructed that
its calculation (i) must be made in accordance with the requirements of this
Agreement and (ii) with respect to each item in dispute, must be within the
range of values established for such amount as determined by reference to the
value assigned to such amount by Purchaser in a Notice of Disagreement and by
Seller in the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall submit such verification and calculation to Seller and
Purchaser as soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days
after the Disputed Items are submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm.
Except for any dispute to the extent relating to any interpretation of Law or
terms of this Agreement (other than the calculation of the Adjustment
Amount), the determination by the Independent Accounting Firm of the
Adjustment Amount and the Excess Cash Amount, as set forth in a written notice
delivered to Purchaser and Seller by the Independent Accounting Firm in
accordance with this Agreement, shall be binding and conclusive on Purchaser
and Seller (such written notice, the " _Final Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement_ "). The Adjustment Amount as determined after all disputes have
been resolved in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.13_ is referred to
herein as the " _Final Adjustment Amount._ "

 

(h) Purchaser and Seller agree that the procedures set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 2.13_ for resolving disputes with respect to the Initial Post-Closing
Adjustment Statement and the calculation of Adjustment Amount and the Excess
Cash Amount shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such
disputes; _provided_ that this provision shall not prohibit any Party from
instituting litigation to enforce any decision pursuant to the terms hereof by
the Independent Accounting Firm in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
substance of the Independent Accounting Firms determination shall not be
subject to review or appeal, absent a showing of fraud or manifest error. The
costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by
the Independent Accounting Form, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
Disputed Items and shall be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm at
the time it renders its determination on the merits of the Disputed Items
submitted. For example, if Seller challenges the calculation of the Purchase
Price by an amount of $100,000, but the Independent Accounting Firm determines
that Seller has a valid claim for only $60,000, then Purchaser shall bear
sixty percent (60%) of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting
Firm and Seller shall bear the other forty percent (40%) of such fees and
expenses.

 



29

    

2.14 _Post-Closing_ _Payments_.

 

(a) The "Post-Closing Adjustment Amount" shall be equal to (a) the Final
Adjustment Amount _less_  (b) the Estimated Adjustment Amount. If the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive amount, then Purchaser shall pay or
cause to be paid to Seller (or to an Affiliate of Seller designated by Seller
in writing), by wire transfer to an account or accounts designated by Seller
in writing, the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount in cash in
immediately available funds. If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a
negative amount, then Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to Purchaser (or
to an Affiliate of Purchaser designated by Purchaser in writing), by wire
transfer to an account or accounts designated by Purchaser in writing, the
absolute value of the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount, in cash
in immediately available funds. Any such payment shall be made within five
(5) Business Days after the Final Adjustment Amount is determined.

 

(b) The "Purchase Price" shall equal the Base Purchase Price _minus_ the
Minority Interest Amount _plus_  the Final Adjustment Amount _plus_ the Final
Excess Cash Amount.

Company on any matter. No Person has any right of first offer, right of first

the case of the Ancillary Agreements, will constitute) a valid, legal and
binding agreement of Seller or the applicable Equity Selling Entity,

effect of any applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential transfers, or

delivery nor performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement by
Seller, any Seller Person or any Acquired Group Company party thereto nor the

have not had or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

to enforceability, to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless
of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at equity or at

entered into any Contract prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank,

54

    

 extent that such information (a) is or becomes in the public domain other
than as a result of disclosure by such Seller Person or its Affiliate or
Representative in violation of this Agreement, (b) later becomes lawfully
acquired by such Seller Person from sources other than those related to its
prior ownership of the Acquired Group Companies and the Business or (c) was or
is independently developed by such Seller Person without reference to any
such confidential documents or information.

5.3 _Efforts_.

 

(a) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, including  _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken
all actions, and to do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable on their part under this Agreement and applicable Law to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals,
permits and authorizations necessary to be obtained from any Governmental
Entity in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Purchaser
and Seller shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the
extent practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information
relating to Purchaser or Seller, the Acquired Group Companies or the Business,
as the case may be, and any of their respective Affiliates, that appears in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights, Seller
and Purchaser shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

(b) _Information_. Subject to applicable Laws, Seller and Purchaser shall,
upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning
itself, its Affiliates, directors, officers or equityholders, as applicable,
and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in
connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made (or to be
made) by or on behalf of Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including under the HSR Act and
any other Antitrust Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the
performance of each Partys respective obligations, Seller and Purchaser may,
as each determines is reasonably necessary, designate competitively sensitive
material provided to the other pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ as
"Outside Counsel Only." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will
not be disclosed by such outside counsel to directors, officers or employees
of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be) or its
legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _
5.3(b)_, materials provided to the other Parties or their counsel may be
redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the Business or
information otherwise not germane to regulatory review.

 



55

    

(c) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of
any Governmental Entity, (i) Seller and Purchaser shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to consents, clearances, approvals
or authorizations of any Governmental Entity of the transactions contemplated

notices or other communications received by Seller or Purchaser, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Affiliates, from any Governmental Entity
with respect to such consents, clearances, approvals or authorizations and
(ii) neither Seller nor Purchaser shall permit any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or any other Representatives to participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any consents, clearances,
approvals, authorizations, filings, investigation or other inquiry with

consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat.

to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

(D) to take, and to cause each of its Affiliates to take, any and all actions
necessary to obtain the Required Governmental Approvals and any other

 connection with any Antitrust Law and enable all waiting periods under any
Antitrust Law to expire, and in the case of Purchaser and its Affiliates, to
take all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any Antitrust Law asserted by any Governmental Entity, in each case, to
enable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur as promptly as
practicable prior to the Outside Date, including promptly complying with or
modifying any requests for additional information (including any second
request) by any Governmental Entity; and

 

(E) to refrain from entering into any agreement, arrangement or other
understanding to acquire any assets, or properties or business that would

or approvals required under or in connection with any Antitrust Law, and to
enable all waiting periods under any Antitrust Law to expire, and to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Law asserted by any Governmental
Entity in respect of a Required Governmental Approval, in each case, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby prior to the termination of
this Agreement, including (A) offering and consenting to, and thereafter
implementing, the following measures: (1) the sale, assignment, transfer,

access, or other requirements, or limitation on the operation of the business
or portion of the business of Purchaser and/or the Business or any of the
Transferred Assets; _provided_ that, if requested by Purchaser, the Acquired
Group Companies will become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or
otherwise take any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long as such requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only binding on
the Acquired Group Companies in the event the Closing occurs, and (B)
contesting, defending and appealing any Action, threatened or pending
preliminary or permanent injunction or other Order, decree or ruling or
statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the
ability of any Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
taking any and all other actions to prevent the entry, enactment or
promulgation thereof.

 

(iii) Purchaser will not withdraw its filing under the HSR Act or any other
Law in respect of a Required Governmental Approval, as the case may be, and
refile it unless Seller has consented in advance to such withdrawal and
refiling.

 



57

or Purchaser or its Affiliates to take or agree to take any action with
respect to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such
agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing.

5.5 _Limitation on Assignment of Transferred Assets; Third-Party Consents_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to sell, transfer, convey, assign or
deliver any Transferred Asset or any right thereunder if an attempted sale,
transfer, conveyance, assignment or delivery thereof without the consent,
approval or other action of any Person would constitute a breach of
any applicable restriction upon such sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment
or delivery, trigger or accelerate rights of any Person, constitute a
violation of or be ineffective under applicable Law and such consent or
approval has not been obtained from, or other action has not been taken by,
such Person on or prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Non-
Assignable Assets_"); _provided_ that, subject to  _Article_ __ _ VIII_, the
Closing shall proceed in accordance with this Agreement and Purchaser shall
pay the full Purchase Price at the Closing without the sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer or delivery of such Non-Assignable Assets.

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, and during the nine
(9)-month period immediately following the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser
shall take, or cause to be taken by others, reasonable best efforts to
cooperate to obtain any consents or approvals required from third parties
(other than consents or approvals from Governmental Entities, which shall be
governed by _Section_ __ _ 5.3_) to assign, convey or transfer the
Transferred Assets (including, after the Closing, the Non-Assignable Assets),
the Material Contracts and the Real Property Leases in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such required
consents, the " _Third-Party Consents_ "). Neither any Seller Person
nor Purchaser will be obligated to pay any amounts or provide other
consideration in connection with obtaining or seeking to obtain any Third-
Party Consent.

 

(c) If any Third-Party Consent is not obtained prior to Closing, until the
earlier of such time as such Third-Party Consent is obtained and nine
(9)-months following the Closing Date, Seller will use reasonable best efforts
to cooperate with Purchaser in any arrangement reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser and Seller intended to (i) provide Purchaser, or Affiliates
of Purchaser (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Group Companies)
designated by Purchaser, to the fullest extent practicable, the rights and

 



61

    

 benefits of the applicable Non-Assignable Assets (including by means of any
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement, if permissible
under applicable Law or Contract) and (ii) cause Purchaser, or such
designated Affiliates of Purchaser, to bear all obligations, costs and
liabilities thereunder from and after the Closing to the extent that
Purchaser, or such designated Affiliates of Purchaser, receives the rights
and benefits of such Non-Assignable Assets from and after the Closing. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its applicable
Affiliates to, promptly pay, perform or discharge when due any related
liability (including any liability for Taxes) arising under such Non-
Assignable Assets after the Closing Date to the extent that Purchaser, or such
designated Affiliates of Purchaser, receives the rights and benefits of such
Non-Assignable Assets from and after the Closing. Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and each of the Retained
Subsidiaries from and against obligations, liabilities and costs assumed by
Purchaser or its Affiliates, pursuant to any arrangement established to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(c)._

 

(d) When the requisite Third-Party Consent is obtained, the applicable
Transferred Asset shall be deemed to have been automatically assigned and
transferred to Purchaser on the terms set forth in this Agreement for no
additional consideration without the requirement of any further action of any
other Person, as of the Closing, except to the extent the date of such Third-
Party Consent is deemed by applicable Law to have occurred on another date, in
which case, as of such date.

(e) If any Third-Party Consent is not obtained, under no circumstances shall
the Purchase Price be reduced or any Seller Person be subject to any liability
on account of failure to obtain any such Third-Party Consent whether prior to
or after the Closing. 

(f) Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_,
neither Seller nor any of the Retained Subsidiaries shall be required to take
any action that may, in the good faith judgment of Seller or such Retained
Subsidiary, violate applicable Law or Contract.

 

5.6 _Public Announcements_. No Party to this Agreement nor any Affiliate or
Representative of such Party shall issue or cause the publication of the
initial press release or public announcement or any subsequent press release
or public announcement in respect of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other Party, except as may be required by applicable Law or stock exchange
rules, in which case the Party required to publish such press release or
public announcement shall to the extent practicable provide the other Party a
reasonable opportunity to comment on and take into account in good faith the
other Partys comments on such press release or public announcement in advance
of such publication; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not restrict
disclosures of information made following the Closing by or on behalf of
Purchaser, Sponsors or their Affiliates or successors to their respective
direct and indirect potential investors, Affiliates, financing sources,
counsel, accountants and consultants, on the other hand (so long as, in each
case, such disclosure has a valid bona fide business purpose and is effected
in a manner consistent with private equity practices and subject to customary
confidentiality obligations).

 



62

    

5.7 _Guarantees_.

 

(a) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause the Retained
Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to, cause each Seller Guarantee
outstanding as of the date hereof to remain outstanding through the date that
such Seller Guarantee is scheduled to expire in accordance with its terms;
_provided_ , that Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for
Seller or the applicable Retained Subsidiary in respect of all obligations of
Seller or any of the Retained Subsidiaries under each Seller Guarantee,
effective as of the first expiration of the term of each such Seller
Guarantee having automatically renewing terms (it being understood and agreed
that upon the expiration of a Seller Guarantee, no Seller Person shall have
any further liabilities or obligations with respect to such Seller
Guarantee).

(b) For so long as any Seller Guarantees remain outstanding after the Closing
Date, (i) Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller
Persons for any Losses arising from or relating to such Seller Guarantees for
the period beginning immediately following the Closing and (ii) Purchaser
shall not permit any of the Acquired Group Companies or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to (A) renew or extend the term of, (B)
increase its or their obligations under, (C) transfer to another third party
or (D) amend in any manner, any such Seller Guarantee. To the extent that
Seller or the Retained Subsidiaries have performance obligations under any
Seller Guarantee, Purchaser shall (x) perform in all respects such obligations
on behalf of Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries or (y) otherwise use
reasonable best efforts to take such actions as reasonably requested by Seller
so as to put Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries in the same position as if
Purchaser, and not Seller or a Retained Subsidiary, had performed or were
performing such obligations.

(c) In furtherance of Purchasers obligations in  _Section_ __ _ 5.7(b)_,
Purchaser shall obtain (and maintain) one or more letters of credit reasonably
satisfactory to Seller (i) in an aggregate amount of no less than $10 million
at any time during the first twelve (12) month period following the Closing
and (ii) in an aggregate amount of no less than $5 million at any time during
the second twelve (12) month period following the Closing (collectively, the "
_Indemnification LC_ "). In the event (and to the extent) that Purchaser
fails to indemnify a Seller Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.7(b)_ by funding the full amount of Purchasers obligations
in respect thereof to such Seller Person or another Seller Person designated
by Seller within three (3) Business Days of Purchaser receiving a valid
written demand for indemnification thereunder, such Seller Person shall be
entitled to draw down on the Indemnification LC in an amount equal to such
indemnified amount that has not been paid by Purchaser. Following the Closing
Date until the earlier of (x) the first date on which Purchaser has obtained
Back-to-Back LCs in respect of all Seller Guarantees outstanding as of such
time in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.7(d) _and (y) the first date on
which no Seller Person has any further liability or obligation to any Person
under any Seller Guarantee, Purchaser shall maintain in effect the
Indemnification LC and obtain any replacement letters of credit to the extent
any amounts under the Indemnification LC are drawn upon or the obligor under
such Indemnification LC is unable or unwilling to perform its obligations
thereunder, and Purchaser shall take no action that would reasonably be
expected to impair Sellers rights under the Indemnification LC to the
extent that or otherwise impede or prevent Seller from obtaining any amounts
payable thereunder to the fullest extent permitted thereby.

 



63

    

(d) To the extent any Seller Guarantee(s) remain outstanding following
the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing, Purchaser shall, from
and after such date, (i) use reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable, obtain (and maintain) one or more letters of credit reasonably
satisfactory to Seller in an aggregate amount sufficient to backstop all
obligations of the Seller Persons under the Seller Guarantees that remain
outstanding as of such time (the " _Back-to-Back LCs_") and (ii) owe interest
to Seller on the amount of such outstanding Seller Guarantees in an amount
equal to (x) two percent (2%) per annum of such Seller Guarantees that are
supported by the Back-to-Back LC or (y) eight percent (8%) per annum of such
Seller Guarantees that are not supported by the Back-to-Back LC, in each
case, payable quarterly in advance to Seller or any Seller Person, as directed
by Seller. Following the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing,
Purchaser shall maintain in effect the Back-to-Back LC for so long as any
Seller Person has any liabilities or obligations in respect thereof and
obtain any replacement letters of credit the extent any amounts under such
Back-to-Back LC are drawn upon or the obligor under such Back-to-Back LC is
unable or unwilling to perform its obligations thereunder, and Purchaser shall
take no action that would reasonably be expected to impair Sellers rights
under the Back-to-Back LC to the extent that or otherwise impede or prevent
Seller from obtaining any amounts payable thereunder to the fullest extent
permitted thereby.

(e) Without limitation of Purchasers obligations pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 5.7_, none of Sponsors, Purchaser or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or their successors or assigns shall (i) consummate
any transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which, upon the
consummation of the transactions or series of transactions contemplated
thereby, the assets and entities comprising the Business (including the
Acquired Group Companies) would no longer be majority-owned (directly or
indirectly) by one or more of the Sponsors or their Affiliates (whether
pursuant to a merger or any transfer of assets or equity interests of any
Person or otherwise) or (ii) consummate an initial underwritten public
offering of equity securities of Purchaser, any Acquired Company in respect of
the Business that is registered under the Securities Act or other similar
public offering, in each case unless Seller and the other Seller Persons are
fully and entirely released from the Seller Guarantees and all liabilities and
obligations of the Seller Persons thereunder.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_
shall require Seller to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, make or
accelerate any payment under Indebtedness, Contract or other obligation for
which Seller or any Retained Subsidiary is or may be liable under any Seller
Guarantee.

 

5.8 _Intercompany Accounts_ _; Affiliate Contracts_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, (all intercompany accounts (except for
the Ancillary Agreements and for any Inter-Company Trade Payables and, for
the avoidance of doubt, intercompany accounts solely between the Acquired
Group Companies) between

 



64

    

 any Seller Person, on the one hand, and any Acquired Group Company, on the
other hand shall be settled or otherwise eliminated (in such a manner as
Seller shall determine in its sole discretion), in each case without any
liability to Purchaser or the Acquired Group Companies (including by Seller or
any of its Affiliates removing from such Acquired Group Company all Cash on
Hand or funds from cash pools by means of dividends, distributions, the
creation or repayment of intercompany debt, increasing or decreasing of cash
pool balances or paid-in capital or otherwise). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that at or prior to the
Closing, Seller and its Subsidiaries, including the Acquired Group Companies
and their respective Subsidiaries, shall be permitted to maintain through the
Closing Date their respective cash management systems and any Seller
Person may capitalize intercompany loans between such Seller Person, on the
one hand, and any Acquired Group Company, on the other hand, by means of an
increase of the amount of paid-in capital of such Person with respect to such
Acquired Group Company and a cancellation of existing Indebtedness under such
intercompany loans as consideration therefor. Following the Closing, Seller
and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
(including, in respect of Purchaser, the Acquired Group Companies) to, settle
the Inter-Company Trade Payables in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice in accordance with their terms.

 

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, all Contracts (other than this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreement or any Contract set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.8(b)_
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule) between any of the Acquired Group Companies
or, with respect to the Business, the Seller Persons, on the one hand, and one
or more of their Affiliates (including Seller, any Equity Selling Entity or
any other Asset Selling Entity but not including any of the Acquired Group
Companies), on the other hand, including all Affiliate Contracts, shall be
settled or otherwise eliminated without any liabilities (including
liabilities arising from such termination) on the part of Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Group Companies) or
any Seller Person.

 

5.9 _German PLTA_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the German Seller to (i) terminate each of the PLTAs effective as of the
Closing Date by issuing termination letters to each of the German Acquired
Companies and providing for a termination for cause pursuant to the terms of
the PLTAs based on the consummation of the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement and (ii) enter into corresponding shareholder resolutions
authorizing the termination of the PLTAs.

 

(b) Immediately following the Closing Date, German Purchaser shall cause the
termination of such PLTAs to be filed for registration with the relevant
German commercial registers. Following the Closing, German Purchaser shall
cause each of the German Acquired Companies to prepare interim financial
statements for the PLTA Period in accordance with German GAAP and, to the
extent compliant with German GAAP, the accounting principles, policies,
practices, evaluation rules and procedures, methods and bases as applied by
the relevant German Acquired Company in its latest financial statements, and,
to the extent required by Law, have them audited by a reputable auditor in
accordance with the applicable standards (the " _PLTA Termination Accounts_
").

 



65

    

(c) German Purchaser shall provide the PLTA Termination Accounts to Seller as
soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in any event
not later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, and all fees, expenses
and costs (including those of the auditor, if any) incurred in connection with
the preparation of the PLTA Termination Accounts shall be borne by German
Purchaser. The Parties shall provide each other with such cooperation,
information and materials as either of them may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation of the PLTA Termination Accounts.

(d) The amount owed under the PLTAs by the German Seller to any of the German
Acquired Companies as compulsory loss compensation payment for the PLTA
Period (such amount, together with any accrued interest thereon, a " _PLTA
Loss Compensation Claim_ ") or the amount owed under the PLTAs by any of the
German Acquired Companies to the German Seller as a profit transfer
obligation for the PLTA Period (such amount, together with any accrued
interest thereon, a " _PLTA Profit Transfer Claim_ "), as the case may be,
shall be determined on the basis of the PLTA Termination Accounts.

(e) In the event that any of the PLTA Termination Accounts shows a PLTA Loss
Compensation Claim, Seller shall, and German Purchaser shall cause the
relevant German Acquired Company to, agree to a conversion of the PLTA Loss
Compensation Claim (including accrued interest, if any) into an interest-
bearing upstream loan (" _PLTA Upstream Loan_ "). Subject to Closing and
immediately upon the conversion into the PLTA Upstream Loan, German Purchaser
shall assume all obligations and liabilities in connection with the PLTA
Upstream Loan from, and under full release of, the German Seller by means of
entering into an assumption agreement and settle the PLTA Upstream Loan in
cash. German Purchaser shall cause the respective German Acquired Company to
declare its consent to the contemplated assumption by Purchaser, by written
declaration.

(f) In the event that any of the PLTA Termination Accounts show a PLTA Profit
Transfer Claim, Seller shall, and German Purchaser shall cause the relevant
German Acquired Company to, agree to a conversion of the PLTA Profit Transfer
Claim into an interest-bearing shareholder loan (" _PLTA Shareholder Loan_ ").
Subject to Closing having occurred, German Seller and German Purchaser shall
agree to a transfer of the PLTA Shareholder Loan to Purchaser with all rights
and obligations pertaining thereto (including accrued interest thereon as of
the Closing Date). German Purchaser shall cause the relevant German Acquired
Company to duly perform all of its obligations (including tax obligations) in
relation to the PLTA Profit Transfer Claim, and the PLTA Shareholder Loan.

 

(g) Following the Closing, German Purchaser shall settle upon request of
Seller, by way of actual payment to the relevant German Acquired Company in
the name of and for the account and on behalf of the German Seller, any and
all claims of the respective German Acquired Company against German Seller in
connection with the PLTAs for periods up until the Closing Date. If and to
the extent that the German Seller receives after the Closing Date a payment by
any of the German Acquired Companies in connection with the PLTA, Seller shall
pay an amount equal to such amount actually received by the German Seller from
the relevant German Acquired Company to German

 



66

    

 Purchaser. Any payments by German Purchaser and/or Seller, as the case may
be, under this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

(h) From and after the Closing Date, German Purchaser shall cause (i)
the German Acquired Companies to duly perform all of their obligations under
the PLTAs in relation to any periods up to the Closing Date and (ii) the tax
returns and the financial statements of the German Acquired Companies for any
periods up to the Closing Date not to be amended to the extent this would
cause a liability of the German Seller to compensate additional losses or to
repay any profits received under the PLTAs.

 

(i) German Purchaser shall, following the Closing Date, (i) furnish at any
time security to any creditor of the German Acquired Companies requested by
such creditor from the German Seller or any of its Affiliates, to which such
creditor is entitled to pursuant to Section 303 of the German Stock
Corporation Act as a result of the termination of any of the PLTAs and (ii)
unless required by Law, ensure that any such security granted by Seller or by
any of Sellers Affiliates are being fully released and replaced.

 

5.10 _Insurance_. (a) From and after the Closing Date, the Acquired Group
Companies shall cease to be insured by the insurance policies maintained by
Seller and or any other Seller Person or by any of their self-insured programs
(the " _Seller Insurance Policies_ "), and neither Purchaser nor its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Group Companies) shall
have any access, right, title or interest to or in any such Seller Insurance
Policies (including to all claims and rights to make claims and all rights to
proceeds) to cover any assets of the Acquired Group Companies or any
liability arising from the operation of the Business; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser and the Acquired Group Companies
shall have the right to make claims and the right to proceeds to the extent
related to the Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities under any Seller
Insurance Policies for occurrence-based claims pertaining to, arising out of
and inuring to the benefit of any Seller Person for all periods prior to the
Closing (other than with regard to the Seller Insurance Policies set forth on
_Schedule_ __ _ 5.10_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Excluded
Insurance Policies_ "). Seller and any other Seller Person may, to
be effective as of the Closing, amend any Seller Insurance Policies in the
manner it deems appropriate to give effect to this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_. From
and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for securing all
insurance it considers appropriate for its operation of the Acquired Group
Companies and the Business. At the Closing, Purchaser agrees to take over and
assume all the known and incurred but not reported claims of the Acquired
Group Companies and the Business, which have been incurred as of the Closing
Date, and Purchaser agrees to be responsible to pay such claims until they are
finally settled and disclosed, subject to the rights described above that it
may have under any Seller Insurance Policies for occurrence-based claims
pertaining to, arising out of and inuring to the benefit of any Seller Person
for all periods prior to the Closing. Purchaser further covenants and agrees
not to seek to assert or to exercise any rights or claims of any Acquired
Group Company or the Business under or in respect of, or make any claims
against, (i) any Excluded Insurance Policies or (ii) any other past or current
insurance policy as of the Closing Date under which any Acquired
Group Company or Affiliate thereof or the Business is a named insured or
otherwise insured, other than, solely in the case of this clause (ii), under
any Seller Insurance Policies for occurrence-based claims pertaining to,
arising out of and inuring to the benefit of any Seller Person for all
periods prior to the Closing. With respect to any matters related

 



67

    

 to the Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities for which insurance
coverage is available under such Seller Insurance Policies, Seller shall seek
the maximum recovery or allow Purchaser to seek recovery under such insurance
policies, in each case, at Purchasers sole cost and expense, and Seller shall
cooperate with Purchaser if it seeks recovery, with respect to such matters
and shall remit any insurance proceeds actually obtained therefrom (net of
Sellers reasonable and documented costs and expenses of seeking such
recovery, to the extent not otherwise paid or reimbursed by Purchaser,
including any Taxes or premium increases resulting therefrom) to Purchaser to
its designee.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, the Seller Persons shall have the right
to make claims and the right to proceeds with respect to any matter related
to the Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities under any insurance policies
for occurrence-based claims pertaining to, arising out of and inuring to the
benefit of any Seller Person or any Acquired Group Company for all periods
prior to the Closing (the " _Business Insurance Policies_ "). With respect to
any Excluded Liability for which insurance coverage is available under the
Business Insurance Policies, Purchaser shall seek the maximum recovery or
allow Seller to seek recovery under the Business Insurance Policies, in each
case, at Sellers sole cost and expense, and Purchaser shall cooperate with
Seller if it seeks recovery, with respect to such matters and shall remit
any insurance proceeds actually obtained therefrom (net of Purchasers
reasonable and documented costs and expenses of seeking such recovery, to the
extent not otherwise paid or reimbursed by Seller, including any Taxes or
premium increases resulting therefrom) to Seller to its designee.

5.11 _Litigation Support_. Other than any adverse claim by Seller or any of
its Affiliates against Purchaser and/or its Affiliates (or vice versa), in
the event and for so long as any Party or their respective Affiliates is
prosecuting, contesting or defending any legal proceeding, Action,
investigation, charge, claim, or demand by a third party in connection with
(a) any transactions contemplated under this Agreement or (b) any fact,
situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction relating
to, in connection with or arising from the Transferred Assets, the Excluded
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Excluded Liabilities, the Business or the
Acquired Group Companies, each Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, reasonably
cooperate with the other Party and its Affiliates and its counsel in such
prosecution, contest or defenses, including making available its personnel
and providing such testimony and access to its books and records as shall be
reasonably necessary in connection with such prosecution, contest or defense.

 

5.12 _Recordation of Transfer of Certain Transferred Assets_. Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser shall be responsible, at its sole cost
and expense, for all applicable recordations of the assignment of the
Transferred Assets, including the Transferred Patents, the Transferred
Trademarks and the Transferred Copyrights from the title owner of each such
Transferred Asset to Purchaser or its Affiliates.

5.13 _Non-Solicitation;  Non-Competition_.

(a) Commencing on and for a period of three (3) years following the Closing
Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly, engage in any business that competes with the Business
anywhere in the world (the " _Restricted Activities_ ").

  



68

    

(b) The Parties agree that nothing herein shall prohibit Seller or
its Subsidiaries from:

(i) acquiring or investing in any Person, or the assets thereof, if less than
ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues, assets and income of such Person or
assets (based on such Persons latest annual audited consolidated financial
statements) are related to or were derived from Restricted Activities;

 

(ii) acquiring or investing in any Person, or the assets thereof, if ten
percent (10%) or more than ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues, assets
and income of such Person or assets (based on such Persons latest annual
audited consolidated financial statements) are related to or were derived from
Restricted Activities; _provided_ , that within one year of such acquisition,
such Party or its Subsidiaries enter into a definitive agreement to divest
itself of all or substantially all of the assets or operations so acquired
that are engaged in Restricted Activities, as applicable (and use reasonable
best efforts to consummate such transaction as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter);

(iii) acquiring or investing in securities representing not more than five
percent (5%) of the outstanding voting power of any Person; _provided_ that
Seller or its Subsidiaries has no representative on the board of directors or
similar governing body;

 

(iv) acquiring or investing in any equity interest in any Person through any
employee benefit plan of such Party or its Subsidiaries; or

(v) engaging in all or any portion of the ESAB and DJO businesses of Seller
and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted.

(c) Commencing on and for a period of two (2) years following the Closing
Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly, solicit for employment (whether as an employee,
consultant or otherwise), offer to hire or engage, hire, employ, engage or
enter into any employment or consulting agreement or arrangement with any
Transferred Employee or other Business Employee; _provided_ , that this
prohibition shall not apply to (i) solicitation of any such individual who has
been terminated by Purchaser or its Affiliates, (ii) solicitations made to
the public or the industry generally through advertising or electronic listing
which are not targeted at employees of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or
(iii) hiring any person who either (A) except for any such employee with
annual compensation greater than or equal to $150,000, responds to a
solicitation permitted under clause (i) or (ii) above or (B) who was not
employed by any of the Acquired Group Companies or Purchaser or
its Affiliates for six (6) months prior to such hiring.

 



69

    

(d) The Parties agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the provisions of _5.13(a)_ and _5.13(c)_ shall not prohibit (i)
Seller or any of the Retained Subsidiaries from performing under any Contract
or owning or operating any other asset that constitutes a Transferred Asset
which is not transferred, conveyed or assigned to Purchaser or one of its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date or (ii) Seller or any of the Retained
Subsidiaries from performing its obligations under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein (including
_Section_ __ _ 12.13_), in the event of a breach of any of the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 5.13(a)_ through _(d)_ (the " _Restrictive Covenants_ "):

 

(i) Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Group Companies)
shall, without limitation of any other available remedy, be entitled to (A)
have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced by any court of competent
jurisdiction and (B) have issued an injunction restraining any such breach (or
threatened breach) without posting of a bond; it being understood that any
breach of any of the Restrictive Covenants would cause irreparable and
material damage to Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Group
Companies), the amount of which cannot be readily determined and as to
which neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Group Companies) will have any adequate remedy at law or in damages;

 

(ii) it is the desire and intent of the Parties that the Restrictive Covenants
be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws, Orders and
public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought
and if any Restrictive Covenant shall be adjudicated finally to be invalid or
unenforceable, such Restrictive Covenant shall be deemed amended to the
extent (and only to such extent) necessary in order that such provision be
valid and enforceable, the remainder of such Restrictive Covenant shall not
thereby be affected and shall be given full force and effect without regard to
invalid portions and such amendment shall apply only with respect to the
operation of the Restrictive Covenant in the particular jurisdiction in which
such adjudication is made; and

 

(iii) the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Restrictive Covenants are
necessary for the protection and preservation of the value and the goodwill
of the Business and each of Purchasers and each Acquired Group Companies
businesses and are reasonable and valid in geographical and temporal scope and
in all other respects.

 

5.14 _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing now existing in favor of any current or former
director, manager or officer (or person holding a similar position) of the
Acquired Group Companies, who is also a Transferred Employee (collectively,
the " _Covered Persons_ ") as provided in the Organizational Documents of the
Acquired Companies [or any indemnity or indemnification agreements or set
forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 5.14_ (the " _Indemnification Agreements_ ")] shall
survive the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall

 



70

    

 continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a
period of not less than six (6) years from the Closing, and Purchaser shall
cause each of the Acquired Companies to honor all such obligations. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, for a period of not less than six
(6) years from the Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any
Acquired Group Company to, amend, modify or terminate any Organizational
Document regarding or related to such indemnification matters. At or prior to
the Closing, Purchaser shall, at Purchasers sole cost and expense, and for a
period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date, maintain (or
shall obtain a six (6)-year "tail" policy providing for) liability insurance
covering the Covered Persons with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Closing Date and containing terms and conditions that are not
less advantageous to the Covered Persons than Sellers existing policies (
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be required to
expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in
excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by Seller for such
insurance (or, in the case of a "tail policy", 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by Seller for such insurance)).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if any Covered Person
is entitled to be reimbursed or indemnified by any Person (including any
Seller Person or the Acquired Group Companies) arising out of or relating to
such Covered Persons actions or omissions occurring at or prior to Closing in
connection with such Covered Persons duties as an officer, director or
manager of any Acquired Group Company, such Covered Person shall not be
required to recover from or be indemnified by or to seek such recovery or
indemnification from, any other Person prior to or as a condition to
being indemnified as described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.14._ Recourse under
the insurance policy required by _Section_ __ _ 5.14(a)_ shall be the first
recourse of the Covered Persons for such reimbursement or indemnification
obligations and in the event recourse under such insurance policy is
insufficient or unavailable, Seller shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, reimburse and indemnify each such Person from, against and
with respect to any such Losses.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.14_ are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Covered Person and each Covered Persons heirs, legatees,
Representatives, successors and assigns, it being expressly agreed that such
Persons shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_, and
(ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or
otherwise. If Purchaser or its successors or assigns (x) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (y)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Purchaser shall assume all of the obligations of
Purchaser under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.14_.

5.15 _Seller Marks_. Purchaser, for itself and its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Acquired Group Companies), acknowledges and agrees
that Purchaser is not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right,
title or interest in or to the Seller Marks and that Seller and the other
Seller Persons are the exclusive owners of Seller Marks, and (a) neither
Purchaser

 



71

    

 nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Group
Companies) shall have any rights in or to the Seller Marks, (b) within ninety
(90) days of the Closing Date (the " _Transition Period_ "), Purchaser shall
cause the Acquired Group Companies to cease any and all use of the Seller
Marks (including in the respective corporate or other legal names of the
Acquired Group Companies), and (c) neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Group Companies) shall
(i) use, register or seek to use or register in any jurisdiction any of the
Seller Marks or any other Marks confusingly similar thereto or (ii) contest
the use, ownership, validity or enforceability of any rights of Seller or any
of its Affiliates in or to any of the Seller Marks. After the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates, including, after the
Closing, the Acquired Group Companies, not to) represent that it has authority
to bind any Seller Person. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing Date, but in any event by the expiration of the Transition
Period, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (x) cease and
discontinue all uses of the Seller Marks and (y) eliminate the Seller Marks
from any signage or other public-facing materials owned or controlled by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date. Purchaser, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, agrees that any use of the Seller Marks
within the Transition Period shall be substantially similar to how such Seller
Marks were used by Seller prior to the Closing Date and in accordance with
all applicable Laws. As between the parties hereto, Seller or its Affiliates
are the sole and exclusive owners of all right, title and interest in and to
the Seller Marks and all rights related thereto and goodwill associated
therewith, and all uses of the Seller Marks and the goodwill arising therefrom
shall inure solely to the benefit of Seller or such Affiliates. Seller and its
Affiliates shall have the right to inspect and exercise quality control with
respect to Purchasers use of the Seller Marks. Purchaser shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates to not, use the Seller Marks in a manner that could
reasonably be expected in any respect to reflect negatively on, or otherwise
adversely affect, any such Seller Marks (including the goodwill associated
therewith) or Seller or any of its Affiliates. Without limiting any other
remedies that may be available to Seller or any of its Affiliates, Seller
shall have the right to terminate the foregoing license upon written notice
to Purchaser, following a thirty (30) day notice and cure period, if Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates materially breaches any of the terms or conditions
set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ or otherwise fails to comply with
any reasonable direction of Seller with respect to the use of any of the
Seller Marks by Purchaser or its Affiliates.

 

5.16 _Misallocated Assets_. If, following Closing, any Party discovers that
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, any
Acquired Group Company) owns any right, property or asset that constituted an
Excluded Asset as of the Closing Date, or that any right, property or asset
that has been transferred by Seller or any other Seller Person to Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates were Excluded Assets as of the Closing Date, then any
such right, property or asset shall be deemed to have been held in trust by
such Acquired Group Company, Purchaser or their Affiliates following the
Closing for the applicable Seller Person, and Purchaser shall, and shall
cause such Acquired Group Company and its other Affiliates to, promptly
transfer, assign and convey such rights, property or assets to Seller (or any
of its Affiliates as designated by Seller) without any consideration
therefor. If, following the Closing, any Party discovers that any Transferred
Asset was not transferred to Purchaser as part of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then any such Transferred
Asset shall be deemed to have been held in trust by the Asset Selling Entity
or their Affiliate still in possession of such Transferred Asset following the
Closing for Purchaser, the applicable Acquired Group Company or their
Affiliate and Seller shall, and shall cause the applicable Asset Selling
Entity to, promptly transfer,

 



72

    

 assign and convey such Transferred Asset to Purchaser as directed by
Purchaser without additional consideration therefor. Without limitation of the
foregoing, Purchaser and Seller shall take the actions set forth on _Section_
__ _ 5.16_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule with respect to any Excluded
Real Property that remains in the possession of any Acquired Group Company
following the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree that (i) the
Excluded Assets are not intended to, and shall not, be transferred to
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Acquired Group Companies) and the Seller Persons shall retain such
rights, properties and assets and (ii) the Transferred Assets are not intended
to, and shall not, be retained by Seller or any of its Affiliates (excluding,
after the Closing, the Acquired Group Companies) from and after the Closing
and Purchaser or its Affiliates shall obtain such rights, properties and
assets at the Closing.

 

5.17 _Payments_.

 

(a) Each Seller Person, as applicable, shall promptly pay or deliver to
Purchaser any monies or checks which have been sent to such Seller Person
after the Closing Date by customers, suppliers or other contracting parties of
the Acquired Group Companies or the Business, as applicable, for goods or
services provided by the Business.

 

(b) Purchaser shall promptly pay or deliver to Seller any monies or checks
that have been sent after the Closing Date to Purchaser, the Acquired Group
Companies or their respective Affiliates to the extent they are Excluded
Assets (including promptly forwarding invoices or similar documentation to
Seller or another Seller Person, as applicable).

 

(c) If, at any time after the Closing, an invoice, bill, purchase order or
other similar documentation from any customer, supplier or other contracting
party of the Business (including through an Acquired Group Company or
otherwise) is received by a Seller Person, such payment constitutes an Assumed
Liability and such Seller Person actually pays any amount with
respect thereto, upon receipt of written notice and reasonable supporting
documentation from such Seller Person, Purchaser shall promptly reimburse such
Seller Person for any and all such amounts actually paid by such Seller
Person.

 

(d) Purchaser acknowledges that the Business currently receives from Seller
and Seller Persons certain administrative and corporate services and benefits
of a type generally provided to other businesses and Affiliates of the Seller
Persons (the " _Support Services_ "). Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that,
except as provided in the Ancillary Agreements, all Support Services shall
cease at Closing, and all agreements and arrangements (whether or not in
writing) in respect thereof shall terminate as of the Closing Date, with no
further obligation of any party thereto.

 

5.18 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Seller and Purchaser shall promptly
notify each other of (a) any Action or investigation commenced or, to the
Knowledge of Seller or to the Knowledge of Purchaser, as applicable,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party
which relates to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder or (b) any change,
condition or event that (i) renders or would reasonably be expected to render
any representation or warranty of such Party

 



73

    

 set forth in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate to an extent such
that the condition set forth in _Sections_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ or _8.3(a)_ , as
applicable, would not be satisfied if the Closing were to then occur or (ii)
result or would reasonably be expected to result in any failure of such Party
to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be completed with or stratified by such Party; _provided_ , that
no such notification, nor any failure to make such notification, shall affect
any of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the
conditions to the obligations of, the Parties hereunder.

5.19 _Misdirected Correspondence_. For ninety (90) days following the Closing
Date, Seller shall forward (or cause to be forwarded) as soon as practicable
to Purchaser all correspondence and written customer or supplier inquiries
received to the extent related to the Business. Thereafter, Seller may return
such correspondence and written customer inquiries to the senders.

5.20 _Transition Services Agreement_. At the Closing, the Parties shall, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, to, enter into the
Transition Services Agreement. To the extent there is a conflict between any
of the provisions of this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement, the
provisions of the Transition Services Agreement shall control with respect to
the subject matter thereof.

5.21 _Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, agree
to, or permit any withdrawal, rescindment, amendment, replacement, supplement
or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy
pursuant to or consent under, (x) the Equity Financing Letter (other than to
increase the amount of Equity Financing available thereunder) or (y) the Debt
Commitment Letters if such withdrawal, rescindment, amendment, replacement,
supplement, modification or waiver would (i) reduce (or would reasonably be
expected to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing below the amount necessary to satisfy the Required Amount (after
taking into account the amount of the Equity Financing and available cash of
the Business) unless the Equity Financing is increased by a
corresponding amount; (ii) impose new or additional conditions or other terms
or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of
the Financing; (iii) expand, amend, or modify any other terms to the Financing
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent the
Closing or (B) make the timely funding of the Financing or the satisfaction of
the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to occur in any respect;
or (iv) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto; _provided_ that Purchaser may amend the Debt
Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as
of the date of this Agreement. Purchaser shall furnish to Seller true and
complete copies of any amendment, replacement, supplement, modification,
consent or waiver relating to the Financing Letters or any Definitive
Financing Agreements as promptly as practicable upon execution thereof.

 



74

    

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper and
advisable to arrange, consummate and obtain the Financing not later than the
date Closing is required to be effected in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.9_, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Letters and any
related Fee Letter (including complying with any request requiring the
exercise of so-called "flex" provisions in any Fee Letter) (or on other terms
that, with respect to conditionality, are not less favorable to Purchaser than
the terms and conditions (including any "market flex" provisions) set forth
in the Financing Letters and any related Fee Letter so long as such other
terms would not (and would not reasonably be expected to) have any result,
event or consequence described in any of clauses (i) through (iv) of
_Section_ __ _ 5.21(a)_), including, using its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Financing Letters in accordance with the terms and
subject only to the conditions therein; (ii) negotiate, enter into, execute
and deliver definitive agreements (which, with respect to the bridge facility
documentation, shall not be required until reasonably necessary in connection
with the funding of the Debt Financing) with respect to the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and related Fee Letter
(which may reflect "market flex" provisions) (or on other terms that, with
respect to conditionality, are no less favorable to Purchaser than the terms
contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and any related Fee Letter
(including any "market flex" provisions applicable thereto) so long as such
other terms would not (and would not reasonably be expected to) have any
result, event or consequence described in clauses (i) through (iv) of
_Section_ __ _ 5.21(a)_), in each case, which terms shall not in any respect
expand on the conditions to the funding of the Financing at the Closing or
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing below the amount required to
satisfy the Required Amount (after taking into account the amount of the
Equity Financing and available cash of the Business) unless the Equity
Financing is correspondingly increased (such definitive agreement, the "
_Definitive Financing Agreements_ "); (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (or, if
deemed advisable by Purchaser, seek the waiver of) all conditions applicable
to Purchaser contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and related Fee Letter
and the Definitive Financing Agreements and in the Equity Commitment Letter;
(iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, including causing
the Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing; (v)
comply with (or, if deemed advisable by Purchaser, seek the waiver of) its
covenants or other obligations pursuant to the Financing Letters and the
definitive documents relating to the Financing on or prior to the Effective
Time; and (vi) enforce its rights pursuant to the Financing Letters.
Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, all commitment or other fees arising
pursuant to the Financing Letters as and when they become due.

 

(c) Purchaser shall, upon request of Seller (i) keep Seller informed on a
reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of any material
developments concerning the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing;
and (ii) provide Seller with drafts (reasonably in advance of execution) of
any Definitive Financing Agreements and other material documents related to
the Debt Financing as shall be necessary to allow Seller to monitor the
progress of such financing activities. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall give Seller prompt notice in writing (but in any
event within two (2) Business Days after the occurrence or discovery of) (A)
of any breach, default (or any event or circumstance that, with notice or
lapse of time or both, could reasonably be

 



75

    

 expected to give rise to any breach or default), cancellation, termination
or repudiation by any party to the Financing Letters or Definitive Financing
Agreements; (B) of the receipt by Purchaser of any written notice or written
communication from any Financing Source with respect to any (1) actual or
threatened breach, default, cancellation, termination or repudiation (or
notice or communications from lenders or other sources of Debt Financing to
Purchaser of any such actual or threatened by any party to the Financing
Letters or any Definitive Financing Agreements of any provisions of the
Financing Letters or such definitive agreements; or (2) material dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to the Financing Letters or any
definitive agreements related to the Financing; and (C) if for any reason
Purchaser at any time believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Financing Letters or any Definitive Financing Agreements
that would reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Purchaser
to obtain all or any portion of the Financing necessary to fund the Required
Amount (after taking into account the amount of the Equity Financing and
available cash of the Business) on the terms and in the manner contemplated by
the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements. Purchaser
shall provide any information reasonably requested by Seller relating to any
of the circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as promptly as
reasonably practical after the date that Seller delivers a written
request therefor to Purchaser.

(d) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including any "flex" provisions in any Fee Letter) contemplated
in the Debt Commitment Letters and related Fee Letter, Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, notify Seller in writing and use its reasonable
best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
occurrence of such event, (i) arrange and obtain the Debt Financing or such
portion of the Debt Financing from the same or alternative sources (A) on
terms and conditions (including any "market flex" provisions) that are at
least as favorable to Purchaser as those contained in the Debt Commitment
Letters and related Fee Letter (including the "market flex" provisions), (B)
containing conditions to draw, conditions to Closing and other terms that
would reasonably be expected to affect the availability thereof that (1) are
not more onerous in any respect than those conditions and terms contained in
the Debt Commitment Letters and related Fee Letter, (2) would not reasonably
be expected to delay the Closing or make the Closing materially less likely to
occur, and (3) in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or such
unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the " _Alternate Debt
Financing_ "); and (ii) obtain one or more new financing commitment letters
with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the " _New Debt
Commitment Letters_ "), which new letters will replace the existing Debt
Commitment Letters in whole or in part. Purchaser will promptly provide a copy
of any New Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith
or other agreements related thereto) to Seller. Any reference in this
Agreement (other than with respect to representations in this Agreement made
by Purchaser that speak as of the date hereof) to (X) the "Financing Letters"
or the "Debt Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include the Debt
Commitment Letters to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment
Letter at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letters to the
extent then in effect, the "Financing Letters" shall refer to such documents
as otherwise amended or modified in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 



76

    

(e) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, refrain from
taking, directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected
to result in the failure of any of the conditions contained in the Financing
Letters or in any definitive agreement relating to the Financing. Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that none of the obtaining of the Financing or any
permitted alternative financing, the completion of any issuance of securities
contemplated by the Financing or Seller or any of its Subsidiaries having or
maintaining any available cash balances is a condition to the Closing, and
reaffirm their obligation to consummate the Transaction irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Financing or any permitted
alternative financing, the completion of any such issuance, or Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries having or maintaining any available cash balances
subject to the applicable conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.21_ will require, and in no
event will the reasonable best efforts of Purchaser be deemed or construed to
require, Purchaser to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any source other than
a counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the
Equity Commitment Letter or (ii) pay any fees in excess of those contemplated
by the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letters.

 

5.22 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, Seller

assist it in causing the conditions in the Debt Commitment Letters to
be satisfied or as is otherwise reasonably requested by Purchaser in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, including using

collateral and the granting of security interests in respect of the Debt
Financing, it being understood that such documents will not take effect until
the Effective Time;

 



77

    

(iv) as promptly as practicable (A) furnishing Purchaser with the Required
Financing Information and such other pertinent and customary information
regarding the Business as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to the
extent that such information is required in connection with the Debt
Commitment Letters and (B) informing Purchaser if the chief executive
officer, chief financial officer, treasurer or controller of Seller or any
member of the board of directors of Seller shall have knowledge of any facts
as a result of which a restatement of any financial statements to comply with
GAAP is probable or under consideration;

(v) assisting Purchaser with the preparation of pro forma financial

Commitment Letter, it being agreed that Seller and its Subsidiaries will not
be required to provide any information or assistance relating to (I) the
proposed aggregate amount of debt and equity financing, together with assumed
interest rates, dividends (if any) and fees and expenses relating to the
incurrence of such debt or equity financing, (II) any post-Closing or pro
forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other pro forma
adjustments desired to be incorporated into any information used in connection
with the Debt Financing or (III) any financial information related to
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or any adjustments that are not directly
related to the acquisition of the Business by Purchaser;

(vi) requesting and facilitating its independent auditors to (A) provide,
consistent with customary practice, (I) customary auditors consents (including
consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to
the Debt Financing) and customary comfort letters (including "negative
assurance" comfort and change period comfort) with respect to financial
information relating to the Business as reasonably requested by Purchaser or
as necessary or customary for financings similar to the Debt Financing
(including any offering or private placement of debt securities pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act) and (II) reasonable assistance to
Purchaser in connection with the Purchasers preparation of pro forma
financial statements and information and (B) attend accounting due diligence

distribution of information to prospective lenders or investors and containing
a customary representation to the Financing Sources as contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters, including that the public side versions of such
documents do not include material non-public information about the Business or
its securities and the accuracy of the information contained in the disclosure
and marketing materials related to the Debt Financing; and

 



78

    

(viii) furnishing at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date
Purchaser and the Financing Sources with all customary documentation and other
information required by U.S. regulatory authorities pursuant to applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the Patriot Act, to the extent requested at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 5.22(a)_,
nothing will require Seller to provide (or be deemed to require Seller to
prepare) any (1) pro forma financial statements; (2) information regarding any
post-Closing or pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership
or other post-Closing pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into
any information used in connection with the Debt Financing; (3) description of
all or any portion of the Financing, including any "description of notes";

404 and Item 601 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act or any other
information customarily excluded from an offering memorandum for private
placements of non-convertible high-yield debt securities under Rule 144A
promulgated under the Securities Act (the foregoing clauses (1) through (5) is
referred herein as " _Excluded Information_ ").

(b) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to provide to Purchaser, as
promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than July 31,
2019, the audited statements of income, equity and cash flows for the fiscal
years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 and
the audited balance sheets of the Business for the fiscal years ended December
31, 2017 and December 31, 2018.

 

(c) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.22(c)_ will require Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to
pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Closing Date; (ii) enter
into any definitive agreement the effectiveness of which is not conditioned
upon the Closing (other than customary representation letters and
authorization letters referred to above); (iii) give any indemnities that are
effective prior to the Closing Date that would not be reimbursed or
indemnified by Purchaser; or (iv) take any action that would unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the Business, breach any confidentiality
obligations or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries. In addition, no action, liability
or obligation of Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document
or instrument relating to the Debt Financing will be effective until the
Effective Time, and neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries will be
required to take any action pursuant to any certificate, agreement,
arrangement, document or instrument that is not contingent on the occurrence
of the Closing or that must be effective prior to the Closing Date. Nothing
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.22(c)_ will require Seller, its Subsidiaries or
their respective directors, officers or employees to

 



79

    

 execute, deliver or enter into, or perform any agreement, document or
instrument, including any definitive financing document, with respect to any
debt financing or adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents
and/or instruments pursuant to which any debt financing is obtained or pledge
any collateral with respect to any debt financing prior to the Closing.
Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.22(c)_ shall require (A) any officer or
Representative of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate
or take any other action under this _Section_ __ _ 5.22(c)_ that could
reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such officer or
Representative; or (B) Seller to approve any financing or Contracts related
thereto prior to the Closing Date (it being understood and agreed that all
certificates, opinions or resolutions shall be delivered by any officer
or board members of the Acquired Group Companies immediately after the
Closing Date). Seller and its Subsidiaries and Representatives shall not be
required to deliver any legal opinions or solvency certificate.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the condition set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, as it applies to Sellers obligations
relating to the Debt Financing, shall be deemed satisfied, and Seller shall
not be deemed to have breached or failed to perform or observe any covenants,
obligations or other agreements contained in this Agreement relating to the
Debt Financing, in each case, unless the Debt Financing has not been obtained
primarily as a result of the failure of any condition precedent to the
funding of the full proceeds of the Financing that is caused by Sellers
willful breach of its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.22(c)_, which
breach has not been cured on or prior to the Business Day prior to the third
Business Day after Purchaser has provided written notice specifically
identifying such breach to Seller.

 

(d) Seller hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in
connection with the Debt Financing so long as such logos (i) are used solely
in a manner that is not intended to, or reasonably likely to, harm or
disparage Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(e) Seller will use its reasonable best efforts, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to use its respective reasonable best efforts, to update any
Required Financing Information provided to Purchaser and the Financing Sources
as may be necessary so that such Required Financing Information (i) is
Compliant, (ii) meets the applicable requirements set forth in the definition
of "Required Financing Information" and (iii) would not, after giving effect
to such update(s), cause the Marketing Period to cease pursuant to the
definition of "Marketing Period." For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser may,
to most effectively access the financing markets, require the cooperation of
Seller and its Subsidiaries under this _Section_ __ _ 5.22_ at any time, and
from time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date hereof and the
Closing Date. Seller agrees to (i) file all reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q
and, to the extent required to include financial information pursuant to Item
9.01 thereof, Form 8-K and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to file all other
Forms 8-K, in each case, required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to
the Exchange Act prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the time
periods required by the Exchange Act. In addition, if, in connection with a
marketing effort contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, Purchaser
reasonably requests Seller to file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to
the Exchange Act that contains material non-public information with respect to
Business, which information Purchaser reasonably determines (and Seller does
not unreasonably object) to include in a customary offering memorandum or
other marketing materials for the Debt Financing, then Seller shall file such
Current Report on Form 8-K. 

 



80

    

(f) All non-public or other confidential information provided by Seller, its
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives pursuant to this Agreement shall
be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except
that Purchaser will be permitted to disclose such information to any
financing sources or prospective financing sources and other financial
institutions and investors that are or may become parties to the Debt
Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents
in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their respective
counsel and auditors).

(g) Promptly upon request by Seller, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for any
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by
Seller, its Subsidiaries or any of its Representatives in connection with the
cooperation or obligations of Seller, its Subsidiaries and their
Representatives contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.22_.

 

(h) Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with their cooperation
in arranging the Debt Financing and the performance of their respective
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.22_ and the provision of any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided
by Seller or its Subsidiaries), in each case, other than to the extent any of
the foregoing was suffered or incurred as a result of the bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of, or material breach of this Agreement by,
Seller and its Subsidiaries or, in each case, their respective
Representatives.

 

(i) In no event will Sponsor, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates
(which for this purpose will be deemed to include each direct investor in
Purchaser and the financing sources or potential financing sources of
Purchaser and such investors) enter into any Contract prohibiting or seeking
to prohibit any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt
or equity financing from providing or seeking to provide debt or equity
financing or financial advisory services to any Person, in each case in
connection with a transaction relating to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or
in connection with the Sale. 

5.23 _Pre-Closing Restructuring_. Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to
effect the restructuring transactions set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.23_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule (as may be amended pursuant to this sentence,
the " _Pre-Closing Restructuring Transactions_") on or before the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that following the date hereof, Seller shall be
permitted to amend _Section_ __ _ 5.23_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
with the extent the effect of such amendments would not cause Purchaser or
any Acquired Company to incur any material cost, expenses or other liability
or adversely affect the operations of the Business, taken as a whole, after
the Closing in any material respect. 

 



81

    

5.24 _Debt Facilities_.

 

(a) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts, and shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts, to deliver to Purchaser at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date evidence that all guarantees
in connection with the Seller Debt Facilities and all Liens relating to the
assets and properties of the Business securing the obligations under the
Seller Debt Facilities shall be released and terminated upon the Closing.

(b) If the Subject Indebtedness (as defined below) is not repaid in full
prior to such time, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts, and shall cause
its applicable Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts, to deliver to
Purchaser at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date a copy of
a payoff letter with respect to the South African Bridge Facility Agreement
(the " _Subject Indebtedness_ ") in customary form, which payoff letter shall
(i) indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all
principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs and any
other monetary obligations then due and payable under the Subject Indebtedness
as of the anticipated Closing Date (and the daily accrual thereafter) (the "
_Payoff Amount_ "), (ii) state that upon receipt of the Payoff Amount under

listed in _Section_ __ _ 1.1(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to be no
less than the amount of Cash on Hand set forth in the column titled "Minimum
Cash Amount" on  _Section_ __ _ 1.1(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule in
respect of each such jurisdiction.

5.26 _Seller Name Change_. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event
more than five (5) Business Days after the Closing, each of Howden North
America, Inc. and Howden Group Holdings GmbH shall cause an amendment to its
certificate of incorporation to be filed with the appropriate Governmental
Entity and shall take all other action necessary to change its legal,
registered, assumed, trade and "doing business as" name, as applicable, to a
name or names not containing "Howden" or any name confusingly similar to the
foregoing and will cause to be filed as soon as practicable after the Closing,
in all jurisdictions in which each of Howden North America, Inc. and Howden
Group Holdings, GmbH is qualified to do business, any documents necessary to
reflect such change in its legal, registered, assumed, trade and "doing
business as" name, as applicable, or to terminate its qualification therein.
Seller further agrees that from and after the Closing, each Seller and its
respective Affiliates will cease to make any use of the name "Howden" and any
similar names indicating affiliation with the Purchaser, any of its
Affiliates, the Business or the business or activities engaged in by Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates.

5.27 _Intellectual Property Assignment_. Seller shall, and shall cause each
other applicable Seller Person to, use commercially reasonable efforts to

ARTICLE VI

EMPLOYEE MATTERS COVENANTS

6.1 _Transferred Employees_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that each Business Employee who, as of immediately prior
to the Closing, is employed by an Acquired Group Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, an " _Acquired Employee_ ") shall continue employment with
such Acquired Group Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately following
the Closing.

 

(b) Purchaser shall continue to employ (or cause employment to be continued
for) each Business Employee who, as of immediately prior to the Closing, is
not employed by an Acquired Group Company, but whose employment automatically
transfers to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates by operation of Law as of or
immediately following the Closing (each, an " _Automatically Transferring
Employee_ ") on terms and conditions as required by Law. Where such automatic
transfer is reasonably anticipated by the Parties, Seller and its Affiliates
shall promptly comply with their obligations under the Transfer
or Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (as amended) or
equivalent automatic transfer Law in other applicable jurisdictions.

 

(c) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, make offers of
employment, effective as of the Closing Date, to all Business Employees who,
as of immediately prior to the Closing, are not employed by an Acquired Group
Company and whose employment does not transfer to Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Acquired Group Companies and
its Subsidiaries) by operation of Law (each, an " _Offer Employee_ "). Such
offers of employment by Purchaser or its Affiliates shall (i) be on terms and
conditions, for location, position, working conditions, and responsibility
that are substantially equivalent to such terms and conditions provided to
such Offer Employees by Seller or any other Seller Person immediately prior to
the Closing Date and (ii) provide for base pay and other compensation and
benefits that are consistent with the requirements of _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_
of this Agreement or, in the case of (i) or (ii), as otherwise sufficient both
to comply with applicable Law and to avoid Seller or any other Seller Person
being obligated to provide any notice, retention, severance, retrenchment or
similar pay or benefits under applicable Law. Purchasers offer of employment
shall be delivered to each such Offer Employee at least five (5) days prior to
the Closing Date, unless required to be delivered earlier pursuant to
applicable Law. Prior to Purchasers delivery of such employment offer

 



83

    

 to such Offer Employee, Purchaser shall provide a draft of such offer of
employment to Seller and give Seller reasonable opportunity to comment on such
offer, including with respect to its compliance with the terms of this
Agreement. Seller agrees that it will, or will procure that its Affiliates
will take all steps reasonably required to release Offer Employees who wish to
accept such an offer with the Purchaser or their Affiliate from its, or their
employment and waive any post termination restrictions binding those Offer
Employees to the extent that they would otherwise prevent the Offer Employee
from being employed by, or in respect of, the Acquired Business.

 

(d) Any Acquired Employee and any Automatically Transferring Employee, as of
the Closing, and any Offer Employee who commences employment with Purchaser
or its Affiliate as of the Closing, shall be referred to as a " _Transferred
Employee_ ".

 

(e) Seller and Purchaser intend that for purposes of any notice, retention,
severance, retrenchment or termination benefit plan, program, policy,
agreement or arrangement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall not constitute a severance of employment of any Transferred Employee
prior to or upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
so that Transferred Employees remain in continuous and uninterrupted
employment immediately before, during and immediately following the Closing.
On or after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible
for, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
from and against, all liabilities in respect of claims made by any Transferred
Employee for notice, retention, severance, retrenchment or other termination
pay or benefits (including claims for constructive dismissal, termination
indemnities, any damages arising from a breach of the Transferred Employees
employment contract, and any payments required to be made under any applicable
Law in respect of the termination of the Transferred Employees employment)
relating to (i) the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, (ii)
Purchasers (or an Affiliates) offer of employment to any Business Employee,
(iii) a Business Employee not accepting Purchasers (or an Affiliates) offer
of employment or his or her transfer of employment by operation of Law, and/or
(iv) termination of employment or constructive dismissal of any Transferred
Employee by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser on or after the Closing
Date.

(f) Seller and Purchaser and their respective Affiliates shall comply with
their obligations under applicable Laws to notify, and where applicable
bargain and/or consult with Business Employees or employee representatives,
unions, works councils or other employee representative bodies, if any, and
shall provide such information to the other Party as may be required by that
Party to comply with its notification, bargaining and/or consultation
obligations or as reasonably requested. Purchaser agrees to recognize all
existing union and/or works council representations, to assume (or honor, as
applicable for Acquired Group Companies) all CBAs and any liabilities with
respect thereto, and to honor all terms and conditions regarding the
Transferred Employees under any existing applicable CBAs, including by
establishing employee benefit plans as required to comply with the terms and
conditions of applicable CBAs, to replace any Seller Benefit Plans specified
in such CBAs. Seller agrees, to the extent reasonably requested by Purchaser
or otherwise required by Law or Contract, to allow Purchaser to participate
in consultations, bargaining and/or negotiations with labor unions, works
councils or other employee representative bodies.

 



84

    

6.2 _Compensation and Benefits_.

 

(a) Except as required by the terms of any Seller Benefit Plan or as
specifically set forth in the Transition Services Agreement, effective as of
the Closing, each Business Employee shall cease to actively participate in
(including eligibility to contribute to) and accrue benefits under all Seller
Benefit Plans and shall commence participation in benefit and compensation
plans established or maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates. After the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to cooperate
with Seller to provide such current information regarding the Transferred
Employees on an ongoing basis as may be reasonably necessary to facilitate
determinations of eligibility for, and payments of benefits to, the
Transferred Employees under any applicable Seller Benefit Plan that continues
to be maintained by Seller or any other Seller Person. Except as otherwise
provided in this _Article_ __ _ VI_, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
assume and/or the Acquired Group Companies shall retain all costs, expenses,
liabilities and obligations for compensation and employee benefits related to
the Transferred Employees and former employees of the Business, regardless of
when such cost, expense, liability or obligation was earned, accrued or
incurred.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, each Business Employee Plan that is not sponsored by
an Acquired Group Company shall be transferred to the applicable Acquired
Group Company effective prior to or as of the Closing. From and after the
Closing, the Acquired Group Companies shall, and Purchaser shall cause the
Acquired Group Companies to honor all Business Employee Plans
and compensation arrangements and agreements with Business Employees in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Closing. Until
the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Transferred Employee (A) base
compensation and annual incentive opportunity (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, does not include any equity-based compensation) that, in each case, are
no less favorable than were provided to the Transferred Employee immediately
before the Closing and (B) all other compensation and benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such
Transferred Employee immediately before the Closing, or at a level otherwise
required by applicable Law and CBA. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, until the date that is twelve (12) months
after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Acquired
Group Companies to, provide to each Transferred Employee who is terminated on
or prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date,
severance benefits equal to the severance benefits for which such Transferred
Employee would have been eligible if then calculated under the terms of the
Benefit Plan applicable as of immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(c) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits, but not, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law or CBA, for accruals under any defined benefit pension plan,
any retiree medical or other post-employment welfare benefits) under the
employee benefit plans of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries providing benefits
to any Transferred Employees after the Closing, including the Business

 



85

    

 Employee Plans (the " _New Plans_ "), each Transferred Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with Seller and its predecessors
before the Closing, to the same extent as such Transferred Employee was
entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar
Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated or was eligible
to participate immediately prior to the Closing;  _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply (x) to the extent that its application would result
in a duplication of benefits and (y) such service was not recognized under the
corresponding Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing. In addition, and
without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall cause, and shall ensure that
each New Plan provide that, each Transferred Employee be immediately eligible
to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the
extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing to a Benefit Plan in which
such Transferred Employee participated immediately before the Closing
(such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "). For purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Transferred Employee, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan are waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under
the comparable plans of Seller in which such employee participated immediately
prior to the Closing, and Purchaser shall cause any eligible expenses incurred
by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such employees participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

(d) With respect to Transferred Employees in the United States:

(i) Purchaser and the "buying group" (as defined in 26 C.F.R. § 54.4980B-9)
shall have the obligation to provide health continuation coverage required by
Section 4980B of the Code or any similar Law (" _COBRA_ ") with respect to
any Transferred Employee (and his or her "qualified beneficiaries," as
defined in Section 4980B(g)(1) of the Code) who experience a "qualifying
event" (as defined in Section 4980B(f)(3) of the Code) after the Closing.

 

(ii) Effective on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide, or cause to be
provided, to the Transferred Employees the right to participate in a "401(k)"
plan that is tax qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, which is
sponsored, established or maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliate (the "
_Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ "). As soon as practicable on or after the Closing
Date, Seller shall cause the accounts (including all assets and liabilities
related thereto) of each Transferred Employee who, prior to the Closing,
participated in any 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Seller or
any other Seller Person (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") to be transferred to
the Purchaser 401(k) Plan, including all promissory notes and receivables in
respect of plan loans to Transferred Employees under Seller 401(k) Plan that
remain outstanding as of the Closing. Purchaser shall direct the trustee of
the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept such transfer of assets and liabilities
from the Seller 401(k) Plan. Such transfer shall be made in accordance with
the applicable requirements of Section 414(l) of the Code.

 



86

    

(iii) Effective on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause
its Affiliates to, establish or designate a defined benefit pension plan that
is tax qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Purchaser U.S.
Pension Plan_ "), for the benefit of any Transferred Employee entitled to
accrue benefits under the Seller U.S. Pension Plan as of the Closing Date
under the HR CBA, which such Purchaser U.S. Pension Plan shall have terms and
conditions that comply with the HR CBA, as such terms may be modified by time
to time in accordance with such CBA and applicable Law. Seller and Purchaser
acknowledge and agree that the treatment of defined benefit pension plan
benefits will require discussions and/or negotiations with the UAW. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange such discussions and/or negotiations prior to the Closing,
and to the extent such discussions and/or negotiations can be arranged, Seller
shall keep Purchaser informed with respect to any communications between
Seller and the UAW regarding such discussions and/or negotiations and, if
requested by Seller or the UAW, permit Purchaser to participate in such
discussions.

 

(e) Without limiting other provisions of this Agreement, as of the Closing
Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall retain and be responsible for providing
retiree health and life insurance coverage, under and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the applicable Seller Benefit Plan, to eligible
retirees and Business Employees. With respect to the United Kingdom:

 

(i) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not assume and/or the Acquired Group
Companies shall not have any liability for any costs, expenses, liabilities
or obligations under the Seller U.K. Pension Plan whether in respect of
Transferred Employees, retirees or former employees. Seller will indemnify
Purchaser and its Affiliates and/or the Acquired Group Companies in respect
of any such liabilities that may arise to them for whatever reason and
relating to the Seller U.K. Pension Plan; and

 

(ii) Seller will indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates and/or the Acquired
Group Companies for any liability arising to any of them in respect of any
Business Employee who has early retirement rights under a pension scheme which
automatically transfer to the Purchaser and its Affiliates and/or the Acquired
Group Companies under the Acquired Rights Directive 77/187/EC or the Transfer
of Undertakings Directive 2001/23/EC or any subsequent legislation.

6.3 _WARN and Corresponding State Laws_. For a period of ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not engage in any
conduct that would result in an employment loss for a significant number of
Transferred Employees which, if aggregated with any such conduct on the part
of Seller or any Seller Person prior to the Closing, would trigger the WARN
Act in the United States, or equivalent or corresponding legislation in any
other

 



87

    

 jurisdiction; _provided_ , that, Seller reasonably cooperates with respect
to the provision of information to Purchaser, upon request, in order to avoid
triggering the WARN Act. Subject to Sellers obligations in the foregoing
sentence, Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible for and agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any
liability under the WARN Act on or after the Closing Date with respect to
Transferred Employees.

6.4 _Unused Vacation, Sick Leave and Personal Time_. Purchaser shall comply
with its obligations under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) Regulations 2006 (as amended) or equivalent provisions under local
Law in respect of unused vacation, sick leave and personal time due to
Transferred Employees who automatically transferred to the Purchaser pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_. To the extent Seller or any Seller Person is
required, including by Law or company policy, to pay out accrued, unused
vacation to any Transferred Employee prior to the Closing (in connection with
any such employees transfer into an Acquired Company or any of their
Subsidiaries) or to any Offer Employee on or following the Closing, Purchaser
shall timely reimburse Seller for all such amounts. In respect of all other
Business Employees. Purchaser shall assume and honor under substantially
equivalent terms and conditions all accrued and unused vacation, sick leave
and other personal time off of each other Transferred Employee for at least
twelve (12) months after Closing. Thereafter, the Transferred Employees shall
be subject to, and commence to accrue benefits under, the vacation, sick leave
and other personal time-off policies of Purchaser applicable to the
respective Transferred Employee, consistent with _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ of this Agreement.

 

6.5 _Workers_ __ _Compensation_. Seller and any other Seller Person shall be
solely responsible for workers compensation claims by or with respect to any
Transferred Employee that are incurred prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser
and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for workers compensation
claims by or with respect to any Transferred Employee that are incurred on or
after the Closing Date in each case in all relevant jurisdictions. For
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, a workers compensation claim shall be
considered incurred before the Closing Date if the harm, loss, injury or
condition giving rise to the claim occurs before the Closing Date. Seller, on
the one hand, and Purchaser on the other, shall provide access to all
applicable records with respect to such workers compensation claims to allow
the other Party (or its Affiliates) to perform its obligations pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_.

6.6  _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for the benefit
of the Parties and is not intended to confer upon any other Persons any rights
or remedies hereunder. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall
(i) limit the ability of Seller, the Acquired Group Companies, Purchaser or
any of their respective Affiliates from terminating the employment of any
employee (including any Business Employee); (ii) be construed to establish,
amend or modify any Benefit Plan or other benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, policy, contract or arrangement; or (iii) limit the
ability of the Acquired Group Companies, Seller, Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan or other
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, policy, contract or
arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any
of them.

Straddle Period, (a) ad valorem or similar Taxes imposed on a periodic basis

that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period and (b) any other Taxes
of the Acquired Group Companies, the Business or the Transferred Assets

7.3 _Certain Tax Refunds_.

 

(a) Seller shall be entitled to the benefit arising from any Excluded Tax
Asset (except to the extent reflected as an asset in Working Capital on the
Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement), and Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing Date, the Acquired Group Companies) shall claim any such Excluded Tax
Asset on any Tax Return for a Post-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ , _however_
, that if any such Excluded Tax Asset is not permitted by applicable Law to be
claimed on a Tax Return for which Seller has filing responsibility and
is permitted by applicable Law to be claimed on a Tax Return for which
Purchaser has filing responsibility pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_, then
Purchaser shall claim such Excluded Tax Asset and pay to Seller the amount of
any benefit resulting from such Excluded Tax Asset actually realized in cash
in the last year such Excluded Tax Asset is claimed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any payment of such benefit attributable to the Transferred Assets
or allocable to any Asset Selling Entity shall be made directly to the
applicable Asset Selling Entity.

(b) Seller shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of or against any
Taxes that are attributable to Seller Indemnified Taxes; _provided_ that
Seller shall not be entitled to any refunds to the extent such refunds were
reflected as an asset in Working Capital on the Final Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement. Any refunds or credits of or against Taxes of the Acquired Group
Companies for any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between
Seller and each Equity Selling Entity and Purchaser in accordance with the
principles set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and the first sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_. Purchaser shall pay, or cause its Affiliates to pay,
to Seller and each Equity Selling Entity, the amount of such refund or credit
(including any interest paid thereon and net of any Taxes incurred by
Purchaser in respect of the receipt or accrual of such refund or credit) in
readily available funds within fifteen (15) days of the actual receipt of the
refund or credit or the application of such refund or credit against Taxes
otherwise payable, and Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly obtain any such refunds and credits.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment of such refund or credit
attributable to the Transferred Assets or allocable to any Asset Selling
Entity shall be made directly to the applicable Asset Selling Entity.

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_, Seller or its designee shall have the
right to elect to control any Tax Proceeding on behalf of the Acquired Group
Companies or any Asset Selling Entity that relates to any Seller Indemnified
Taxes (each, a " _Seller Tax Contest_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
or its designee shall not settle any such Seller Tax Contests without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in
writing upon receiving notice from any Tax Authority of the commencement of
any Seller Tax Contest, and Purchaser shall take all actions reasonably
necessary (including providing a power of attorney) to enable Seller or its
designee to exercise its control rights as set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
7.4_; _provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to give such notice will not
affect Purchasers rights to indemnification under _Article_ __ _ X_, except
to the extent that Seller is actually prejudiced thereby.

 



91

    

(b) In the case of any Tax Contest of or relating to a Straddle Period
that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Tax for any Post-
Closing Tax Period (or portion thereof), Purchaser shall have the right to
control such Tax Contest by notifying Seller within ten (10) Business Days of
receiving notice of such Tax Contest; provided, however, that in the case of
any U.S. federal, state or local income Tax Contest of or relating to a
Straddle Period that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any income
Tax for any Post-Closing Tax Period (or portion thereof), Seller shall have
the right to control such Tax Contest by notifying Purchaser within ten (10)
Business Days of receiving notice of such Tax Contest. The party in control of
any such Tax Contest pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_ shall (i) keep
the non-controlling party reasonably informed with respect to any material
developments or communications (including telephonic communications) related
to such Tax Contest, (ii) provide the non-controlling party with the right, at
the non-controlling partys sole expense, to participate in such Tax Contest
(to the extent permitted by the applicable Tax Authority) and (iii) not settle
such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of the non-controlling
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment resulting from such Seller Tax
Contest attributable to the Transferred Assets or allocable to any Asset
Selling Entity shall be made directly to the applicable Asset Selling Entity.

 

7.5 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_.

 

(a) Not more than fifteen (15) days after the receipt of a request from Seller
and each Equity Selling Entity, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, provide to such requesting Party a package of Tax information
materials, including schedules and work papers, requested by Seller and each
Equity Selling Entity to enable Seller and each Equity Selling Entity, to
review or to prepare and file all Tax Returns required to be prepared by it
with respect to the Acquired Group Companies or the Transferred Assets.
Purchaser shall prepare such package completely and accurately, in good faith
and in a manner consistent with such Sellers and each Equity Selling
Entitys past practice.

(b) Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to the other
Party to this Agreement such cooperation, documentation and information as
either of them reasonably may request in (i) filing any Tax Return, amended
Tax Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining a liability for Taxes or an
indemnity obligation under this _Article_ __ _ VII_ or _Article_ __ _ X_ or
a right to refund of Taxes, or (iii) conducting any Tax Proceeding.
Such cooperation and information shall include providing necessary powers of
attorney, copies of all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together
with all relevant portions of relevant accompanying schedules and relevant
work papers, relevant documents relating to rulings or other determinations
by Tax Authorities, and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax
basis of property and other information, which any such Party may possess.

convenient basis at its cost to provide an explanation of any documents or
information so provided.

 



92

documents relating to Tax matters, of the Acquired Group Companies, the
Business or the Transferred Assets for their respective Tax periods ending on

limitations for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents
relate. Thereafter, the Party holding such Tax Returns or other documents may
dispose of them after offering the other Party reasonable notice and
opportunity to take possession of such Tax Returns and other documents at such
other Partys own expense.

7.6 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. To the extent relating to Acquired Group
Companies, Seller and each Equity Selling Entity shall terminate or cause to
be terminated, on or before the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements or
arrangements (other than this Agreement), if any, to which any Acquired Group
Company, on the one hand, and Seller or an Equity Selling Entity, on the other
hand, are the sole parties, and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates nor
Acquired Group Companies shall have any rights or obligations thereunder
after the Closing; _provided_ that the obligations set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 7.6_ shall exclude the termination of the Transition Services Agreement.

 

7.7 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Except to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law (including pursuant to a "determination" (within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law)), Seller, each Equity Selling Entity and Purchaser shall (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to) treat any and all payments under
this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_, and _Article_ __ _ X_ as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 

7.8 _Certain Actions_. Except as otherwise provided in _Schedule_ __ _ 7.8_,
Purchaser shall not make, and shall cause its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Acquired Group Companies) not to make, any Tax election with
respect to any Acquired Group Company, which election would be effective or
have effect on or prior to the Closing Date (including any election under
Section 338(g) of the Code or any analogous U.S. state or local Tax Law).

7.9 _Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Election_. No election shall be made by the
Parties under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (or analogous state or local Tax
Law) (a " _Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Election_"); _provided_ that, Seller
shall, in good faith, consider any request by Purchaser to make a Section
338(h)(10) Election with respect to the sale of Howden American Fan Company or
Howden Construction Services, Inc., and Seller shall be required to make any
such election only if the purchase price payable under this Agreement is
increased, as necessary, in order to ensure that Sellers after-Tax proceeds
as a result of such Section 338(h)(10) Elections are no less (as
reasonably determined in good faith by the Seller in consultation with
Purchaser) than such after-Tax proceeds would have been absent such elections
(taking into account any Taxes imposed on the increased purchase price).

7.10 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, except with respect to any Transfer Taxes that are related to or
arise from the Pre-Closing Restructuring Transactions, which shall be Sellers
responsibility, Purchaser shall pay, when due,

 and be responsible for, any and all other applicable Transfer Taxes. The
Party responsible under applicable Law for filing the Tax Returns with respect
to such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and timely file such Tax Returns and
promptly provide a copy of such Tax Return to the other Party. Seller and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate to
timely prepare and file any Tax Returns or other filings relating to such
Transfer Taxes, including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the
application or imposition of any Transfer Taxes.

thereof (if any such acknowledgement or receipt is received).

(b) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall file any Tax Return
with, or otherwise provide any information (other than information provided in
response to an inquiry by the PRC Tax Authority where the disclosure of such
information is reasonably necessary) related to, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to the PRC Tax Authority related to the
Indirect Capital Gains Tax (a " _Purchaser PRC Notice_ ") unless (i) the PRC
Tax Authority notifies Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate that it is

Seller to the Purchaser PRC Notice, and (C) confer with Seller in good faith
regarding the timing of the proposed filing and the identity of the applicable

ARTICLE IX

 

TERMINATION

9.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

(b) by either Seller or Purchaser, upon written notice to the Party, if:

 

(i) the Closing shall not have occurred on or before November 15, 2019 (as
such date may be extended pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(i)_, the "
_Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the conditions set forth
in _Sections_ __ _ 8.1(a)_, (b) or (c) (but for the purposes of  _Section_
__ _ 8.1(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_, only if such Order or Law is under
or pursuant to applicable Law in respect of a Required Governmental Approval)
shall not have been satisfied or duly obtained but all other conditions to
Closing set forth in _Article_ __ _ VIII_ have been satisfied by the Outside
Date (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied
until the Closing Date), then either Party may, in its sole discretion,
extend the Outside Date by written notice to the other Party by an additional
ninety (90) days; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any
Party whose failure or whose Affiliates failure to perform any covenant or
obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of or has resulted in the
failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur on or
before the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Marketing Period
has commenced but not yet been completed at the time of the Outside Date, the
Outside Date may be extended by Purchaser in its sole discretion by providing
written notice thereof to Seller at least one (1) Business Day prior to the
Closing Date until the date that is four (4) Business Days after the then-
scheduled expiration date of the Marketing Period (and, in the case of
any extension pursuant to this proviso, any reference to the Outside Date in

Date, as extended); _provided_ , _further_ , that to the extent a Government
Shutdown prevents the occurrence of the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.1(a)_ prior to the Outside Date, the Outside Date shall be the earlier of
(x) February 15, 2020 and (y) the first Business Day that is at least
sixty (60) calendar days after the Federal Trade Commission or other
applicable Governmental Antitrust Entity has been appropriated funding to be

97

    

(ii) if any Order issued, or Law enacted, entered or promulgated, by
a Governmental Entity permanently restrains, enjoins or prohibits or makes
illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements, and such Order becomes effective and final and
nonappealable;

 

(c) by Seller, upon written notice to Purchaser, if Purchaser shall have
breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, and such breach or
failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ and (ii) (x) cannot be
cured prior to the Outside Date or (y) has not been cured prior to the date
that is thirty (30) days from the date that Purchaser is notified by Seller in
writing of such breach or failure to perform; or

(d) by Purchaser, upon written notice to Seller, if Seller shall have breached
or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements contained in this Agreement, and such breach or failure to
perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ and (ii) (x) cannot be
cured prior to the Outside Date or (y) has not been cured prior to the date

Business Days after the first date on which Purchaser is required to
consummate the Closing pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, and (iii) Seller
has irrevocably confirmed to Purchaser in writing that it is prepared to
consummate the Closing.

 

(f) by Purchaser, upon written notice to Seller as expressly set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(f)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

9.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of a valid termination of this Agreement by either or both of
Seller and Purchaser pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, this Agreement shall
terminate and become void and have no effect, and there shall be no liability
on the part of any Party to this Agreement, except as set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 5.2_ ( _Confidentiality_ ), _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ ( _Public
Announcements_ ), _Section_ __ _ 5.22(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.22(b)_ and
_Article_ __ _ XI_ ( _General Provisions_ ) shall survive any termination of
this Agreement. The obligation of the Parties under the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement unchanged.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (x) nothing herein shall operate to
limit the common law liability of Seller for

 



98

    

 fraud, in the event that Seller is finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have willfully and knowingly committed fraud against
Purchaser, with the specific intent to deceive and mislead Purchaser,
regarding the representations and warranties made in this Agreement and (y)
the Purchaser Termination Fee and the Reimbursement Obligations, when such
amounts are due and payable hereunder, shall be Sellers and its Affiliates
sole and exclusive remedy against Purchaser and the Purchaser Related Parties
for the failure of the Closing to occur, including in respect of a breach of
this Agreement, whether or not intentional.

 

(b) If this Agreement is validly terminated (i) by Seller pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_ or (ii) by either party
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_ and at such time Seller could have validly
terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_,
then Purchaser must promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days)
following such termination pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller an amount equal
to the Purchaser Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Seller.

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) in no event will Purchaser be
required to pay the Purchaser Termination Fee on more than one occasion,
whether or not the Purchaser Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more
than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and
upon the occurrence of different events and (ii) any payment of the Purchaser
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ is not a penalty but is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Seller in the
circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts and resources
expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision.

 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __
_ 9.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Purchaser fails to promptly pay all or
any portion of the Purchaser Termination Fee, as and when due pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Seller commences
an Action that results in a judgment against Purchaser for the payment of all
or such portion of the Purchaser Termination Fee, Purchaser shall reimburse
Seller for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such Action;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such action is decided in favor of Purchaser, Seller shall
instead reimburse Purchaser for its reasonable and documented out of pocket
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such
Action.

(e) Sellers receipt of the Purchaser Termination Fee (to the extent owed
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ (including Sellers right to enforce the
Limited Guaranty with respect thereto and receive the Purchaser Termination
Fee)), Sellers receipt of payments to the extent owed by Purchaser pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 5.22(e)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.22(g)_ and _Section_ __ _
9.2(d)_ (collectively, the " _Reimbursement Obligations_ "), Sellers right to
enforce 

 



99

    

 its rights under the Confidentiality Agreement and Sellers right to
specific performance prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 11.11_ will be the sole and exclusive remedies of Seller and
its Affiliates against (A) Purchaser or Sponsors; (B) the former, current and
future holders of any equity, controlling persons, Affiliates (other than
Purchaser or the Sponsors), Representatives, members, managers, general or
limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of Purchaser and the
Sponsors (collectively with the Sponsors, the " _Purchaser Related Parties_ ")
and (C) the Financing Sources in respect of this Agreement, any agreement
executed in connection herewith (including the Debt Commitment Letters and the
Limited Guaranty) and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and
upon payment of such amounts, none of Purchaser, the Purchaser Related
Parties or the Financing Sources will have any further liability or obligation
to Seller or any of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith (including the
Debt Commitment Letters and the Limited Guaranty) or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates)
will remain obligated with respect to, and Seller may be entitled to remedies
with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Reimbursement
Obligations. The Purchaser Related Parties and the Debt Financing Sources are
intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 9.2(e)_. In no
event shall Purchaser or the Sponsors have liability (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) for any monetary damages (including
monetary damages in lieu of specific performance arising out of, related to or
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
except for the Purchaser Termination Fee (less any portion thereof that has
been paid) plus any amounts owed by Purchaser under any Reimbursement
Obligations, and the amount of Purchaser Termination Fee and any amounts owed
by Purchaser under the Reimbursement Obligations shall be the maximum
aggregate liability of Purchaser hereunder (and of Sponsors under the Limited
Guaranty), and neither Seller nor any other Person shall have any claim or
recourse against any Purchaser Related Party as a result of the breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained herein
or otherwise arising out of or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Equity Financing). Without
limiting the foregoing, in no event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates
seek, or permit to be sought, on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates,
any monetary damages from any Purchaser Related Party in connection with this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Equity
Financing, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Reimbursement Obligations,
other than (without duplication) from Purchaser to the extent provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.2(d)_. Nothing in this _Section_
__ _ 9.2(e)_ shall in any way expand or be deemed to expand the circumstances
in which Purchaser or any Purchaser Related Party may be liable under this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Equity
Financing).

 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, while Seller may pursue both a grant of
specific performance in accordance with, and subject to the limitations set
forth in, _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ and the payment of the Purchaser Termination
Fee under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_, under no circumstances shall Seller be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the
type contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ that results in a consummation of
the Closing and payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee.

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the Party or Parties liable
for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any
pending or threatened claim or demand that the Indemnified Party has
determined gives or would reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of
indemnification hereunder (including a pending or threatened claim or demand
asserted by a third Party against the Indemnified Party, such claim being a "
_Third-Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this 
_Article_ __ _ X_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying

 



102

    

 Party is actually prejudiced by such failure, it being agreed that notices
for claims in respect of a breach of any covenant or agreement must be
delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival period specified
in _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ for such covenant or agreement.

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third-Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
10.3(a)_, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to
the Indemnified Party delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the
receipt of notice of such Third-Party Claim, to assume the defense and control
of such Third-Party Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party);
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim
with its own counsel and at its own expense; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of any
Third-Party Claim and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct
the defense of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom and in
connection therewith to employ, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, one
counsel of its choice in each applicable jurisdiction (if more than one
jurisdiction is involved) to represent the Indemnified Party (i) if the
Indemnifying Party elects in writing not to defend, compromise or settle a
Third-Party Claim, (ii) if the Third-Party Claim primarily seeks injunctive or
other equitable relief; (iii) if the Third-Party Claim would reasonably be
expected to impair, in any material respect, any Indemnified Partys or its
Affiliates business or relationships with any of such Persons material
customers or suppliers; or (iv) if the Third-Party Claim involves criminal
conduct. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense and control of
any Third-Party Claim pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.5(b)_, the
Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in the defense of such Third-
Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense and control of a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall select counsel, contractors and consultants of
recognized standing and competence and shall use reasonable best efforts in
the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim. Each Party shall, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates and Representatives to, reasonably
cooperate with the other Party in the defense of any Third-Party Claim,
including by furnishing books and records, personnel and witnesses,
as appropriate for any defense of such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party has assumed the defense and control of a Third-Party Claim, it shall be
authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any Third-Party Claim, in its sole discretion and without the consent
of any Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that such settlement or judgment does
not involve any injunctive relief binding on any of the Indemnified Parties or
finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing
by any Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay or cause to
be paid all amounts in such settlement or judgment and (ii) obtain, as a
condition of any settlement or other resolution, a complete and unconditional
release of the Indemnified Parties potentially affected by such Third-Party
Claim. No Indemnified Party will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement or compromise with respect to a Third-Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 10.5(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule will apply with
respect to any Third-Party Claim relating to the Specified Excluded
Liabilities.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed and to be
performed wholly within such State and without reference to the choice-of-law
principles that would result in the application of the Laws of a different
jurisdiction.

(b) Each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, solely if such court declines

Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and hereby irrevocably
agrees that all claims in respect of such Action may be heard and determined
in such court. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
that it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such Action. The Parties further agree, (i) to the extent
permitted by Law, that final and unappealable judgment against any of them in
any Action contemplated

and (ii) that service of process upon such Party in any such Action shall be
effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.7_.

connection herewith or the administration thereof or any of the transactions
contemplated herein or therein. No Party to this Agreement shall seek a jury
trial in any Action based upon, or arising out of, this Agreement or any
related instruments or the relationship between the Parties. No Party will
seek to consolidate any such Action in which a jury trial has been waived with
any other action in which a jury trial cannot be or has not been waived. Each
Party to this Agreement certifies that it has been induced to enter into this
Agreement or instrument by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications set forth above in this  _Section_ __ _ 11.3_. No Party has
in any way agreed with or represented to any other Party that the provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 11.3_ will not be fully enforce in all instances.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _
11.3_, each party to this Agreement acknowledges and irrevocably agrees (i)
that any legal action, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance thereunder
shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), (ii)
that, except to the extent relating to the interpretation of any provisions in
this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter
and/or the Limited Guaranty, any legal action, whether at law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of New York, (iii) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring any
such legal action in any other court and (iv) that the provisions of _Section_
__ _ 11.3(d)_ shall apply to any such legal action. 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not bring or support any
litigation against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than a court of competent
jurisdiction sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York,
whether a state or federal court, that the provisions of _Section_ __ _
11.3(c)_ relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such action,
suit or proceeding and that, except to the extent relating to the
interpretation of any provisions in this Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and/or the Limited Guaranty, any such
action, suit or proceeding shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the Laws of the State of New York.

 



107

11.8 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) no Party
(other than Purchaser as provided below) may directly or indirectly assign any
or all of its rights or delegate any or all of its obligations under this
Agreement without the express prior written consent of the other Party to this
Agreement and (b) Purchaser may assign any or all of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement without the consent of Seller to (i) one or more of
its Affiliates or (ii) any Financing Source pursuant to the terms of the Debt

assigning as collateral in respect of the Debt Financing; _provided_ that, in
each case, no assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its
obligations hereunder.

11.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or amended
except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the Party against
whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought; _provided_
that any modification or amendment of this proviso of  _Section_ __ _ 11.9_,
the proviso to _Section_ __ _ 11.5_, _Section_ __ _ 11.3(c)_ (solely to the
extent that it relates to the Financing Sources), _Section_ __ _ 11.3(d)_

109

    

 of the Financing Sources, will not be effective against the Financing
Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources. Either
Party to this Agreement may, only by an instrument in writing, waive
compliance by the other Party to this Agreement with any term or provision of
this Agreement on the part of such other Party to this Agreement to be
performed or complied with. The waiver by any Party to this Agreement of a
breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent breach.

11.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a
determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

11.11 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would
occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of
it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions; (B) the Parties will be
entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or
in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (C) the provisions of _Section_
__ _ 9.2_ are not intended to and do not adequately compensate Seller
for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not
be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Partys right
to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (D) the
right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither Seller nor
Purchaser would have entered into this Agreement. The Parties agree not to
raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by Seller, on the one hand, or
Purchaser, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements
of Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or
enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other
security. The Parties further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided
for in this  _Section_ __ _ 11.11_, a Party shall not in any respect waive
its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a Party
under this Agreement, and (y) nothing set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
11.11_ shall require any Party to institute any

 



110

    

 proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for)
specific performance under this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ prior or as a condition
to exercising any termination right under _Article_ __ _ IX_, nor shall the
commencement of any Action pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ or anything
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ restrict or limit any Partys right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article_ __ _
IX_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available
then or thereafter.

 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 11.11(a)_, it is acknowledged and agreed
that the Seller has the right to obtain an injunction, specific performance
or other equitable remedy in connection with enforcing Purchasers obligation
to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Closing if,
and only if, (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all of the conditions set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing); (ii)
the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the
Equity Financing is funded at the Closing; (iii) Purchaser fails to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the date that it is
required to consummate the Closing under _Section_ __ _ 2.9_; and (iv) Seller
has confirmed in a written notice to Purchaser that if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it is
prepared to consummate the Closing and to take such actions that are required
of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. In no event will Seller
be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Purchasers obligation
to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the Sale if the Debt
Financing (x) will not be contemporaneously funded with the Equity Financing
or (y) has not been funded in full.

11.12 _Release_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, including the Acquired Group Companies, hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably waives any claims that such Person has or may have in the
future against Seller or any of the Retained Subsidiaries, as applicable,
releases Seller and each of the Retained Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from any liability, obligation or responsibility
to any of them for any and all past actions or failures to take action prior
to the Closing, including any actions which may be deemed to have been
negligent or grossly negligent, relating to or arising out of Contracts with
Seller or a Subsidiary thereof or the operation or conduct of any businesses,
assets, properties (including activities performed thereat) or operations
managed or operated by, or operationally related to, directly or indirectly,
the Business or any other businesses of the Seller Persons, except in the case
of fraud or for any obligation pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or
the Transition Services Agreement.

 

(b) Effective as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any claims that
such Person has or may have in the future against the Acquired Group
Companies, releases the Acquired Group Companies and their respective
Representatives from any liability, obligation or responsibility to any of
them for any and all past actions or failures to take action, relating to the
operation or conduct of any businesses, assets, properties (including
activities performed thereat) or operations managed or operated by, or
operationally related to, directly or indirectly, the Business or the
Acquired Group Companies prior to the Closing, except, for the avoidance of
doubt, for any obligation pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the
Transition Services Agreement.

 



111

    

11.13 _Bulk Sale Laws_. Each Party hereby waives compliance by the other Party
or its Affiliates, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
with the provisions of any applicable bulk sales or bulk transfer or similar
Law.

 

11.14 _No Admission_. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission by Seller or
other Seller Persons, in any Action or investigation involving a third party,
that Seller or such other Seller Persons or any such third party is or is not
in breach or violation of, or in default in, the performance or observance of
any term or provisions of any Contract.

 

11.15 _Further Assurances_. Each of the Parties shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to, from time to time at the request of another Party,
without any additional consideration, furnish such requesting Party such
further information or assurances, execute and deliver such additional
documents, instruments and conveyances, and take such other actions and do
such other things, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out
the provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and give effect
to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including to vest in
Purchaser or its designated Affiliates good and valid title to the Equity and
the Transferred Assets.

11.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and by
either of the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of
a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or electronic mail in
"printable document format" (" _.pdf_ ") or similar format shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 

11.17 _Waiver of Claims Against Financing Sources_. None of the Financing
Sources will have any liability to the Seller or its Affiliates relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at
law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither Seller nor any
of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any of the
Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder.
