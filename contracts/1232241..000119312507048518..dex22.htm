a single arbitrator. The final arbitrator, who shall be impartial, will be selected by the two partial arbitrators. In the event the two partial arbitrators shall fail to select an impartial arbitrator, either party may apply to a court of law to
have a judge select an impartial arbitrator. The three arbitrators by majority ruling may adopt such procedures as they deem efficient and appropriate for making the determinations submitted to them for adjudication. No statements by, or
