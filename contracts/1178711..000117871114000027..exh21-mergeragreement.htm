AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is
made and entered into as of June 30, 2014, by and among TRANSCEPT
PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Tigris"), TIGRIS MERGER SUB,
INC., a Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub"), TIGRIS ACQUISITION SUB, LLC, a
single member Delaware limited liability company ("Merger LLC"), and PARATEK
PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Potomac"). Certain capitalized
terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

RECITALS

A. Tigris and Potomac intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub into Potomac
(the "Merger") in accordance with this Agreement and the DGCL. Upon
consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and Potomac will
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tigris.

B. The Parties intend that the Merger shall be immediately followed by a
merger of the Surviving Corporation (as defined below) with and into Merger
LLC with Merger LLC surviving (the "Second Merger"), on the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware
Limited Liability Company Act (the "DLLCA").

C. The Parties intend that the Merger be mutually interdependent with and a
condition precedent to the Second Merger and that the Second Merger shall,
through the binding commitment evidenced by Section 1.1(b), be effected
immediately following the Effective Time (as defined below), on the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the DLLCA,
without further approval, authorization or direction from or by any of the
parties hereto.

D. The Parties intend to adopt this Agreement as a plan of reorganization
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a)
and for the Merger and the Second Merger, considered together as a single
integrated transaction for United States federal income Tax purposes, to
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

E. The Board of Directors of Tigris (i) has determined that the Merger is fair
to, and in the best interests of, Tigris and its stockholders, (ii) has
approved this Agreement, the Merger, the issuance of shares of Tigris Common
Stock to the stockholders of Potomac pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
the change of control of Tigris, and the other actions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iii) has determined to recommend that the stockholders of
Tigris vote to approve the issuance of shares of Tigris Common Stock to the
stockholders of Potomac pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the change of
control of Tigris and such other actions as contemplated by this Agreement.

F. The Board of Directors of Merger Sub (i) has determined that the Merger is
fair to, and in the best interests of, Merger Sub and its sole stockholder,
(ii) has approved this

 Agreement, the Merger, and the other actions contemplated by this Agreement
and has deemed this Agreement advisable and (iii) has determined to recommend
that the stockholder of Merger Sub vote to adopt this Agreement and thereby
approve the Merger and such other actions as contemplated by this Agreement.

G. The Board of Directors of Potomac (i) has determined that the Merger is
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Potomac and its
stockholders, (ii) has approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has deemed this Agreement
advisable and (iii) has determined to recommend that the stockholders of
Potomac vote to adopt this Agreement and thereby approve the Merger and such
other actions as contemplated by this Agreement.

H. In order to induce Tigris to enter into this Agreement and to cause the
Merger to be consummated, the officers and directors of Potomac and
stockholders affiliated therewith listed on Schedule A hereto, are executing
support agreements in favor of Tigris concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement in the form substantially attached hereto as
Exhibit B (the "Potomac Stockholder Support Agreements").

I. In order to induce Potomac to enter into this Agreement and to cause the
Merger to be consummated, the officers, directors and certain stockholders of
Tigris listed on Schedule B hereto are executing support agreements in favor
of Potomac concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement in
the form substantially attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Tigris Stockholder
Support Agreements").

J. It is expected that within four (4) Business Days after the Form S-4
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, the
holders of shares of capital stock of Potomac sufficient to adopt and approve
this Agreement and the Merger as required under the DGCL and Potomac's
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws will execute and deliver an action by
written consent adopting this Agreement, in a form reasonably acceptable to
Tigris, in order to obtain the Required Potomac Stockholder Vote (each, a
"Potomac Stockholder Written Consent" and collectively, the "Potomac
Stockholder Written Consents").

K. Immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition of the willingness of Tigris to enter into this Agreement, certain
investors have executed the Subscription Agreement with Potomac pursuant to
which such investors have agreed to purchase certain shares of capital stock
of Potomac prior to the Closing in connection with the Potomac Pre-Closing
Financing.

L. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition of the willingness of Potomac to enter into this Agreement, Tigris
has provided certain bridge financing to Potomac pursuant to a Note Purchase
Agreement between Tigris and Potomac (each Promissory Note issued thereunder,
a "Tigris Note" and collectively, the "Tigris Notes").

 AGREEMENT

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

Section 1. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION

1.1 Structure of the Merger and Second Merger.

(a) Merger of Merger Sub into Potomac. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into Potomac, and the separate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease. Potomac will continue as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

(b) Second Merger. Immediately after the Effective Time on the Closing Date,
the Surviving Corporation shall be merged with and into Merger LLC, and the
separate existence of the Surviving Corporation shall cease. Merger LLC shall
be the successor or surviving entity in the Second Merger (the "Surviving
Company"). There shall be no conditions to the completion of the Second Merger
other than the completion of the Merger.

1.2 Effects of the Merger and Second Merger. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. As a
result of the Merger, Potomac will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tigris.
The Second Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA.

1.3 Closing; Effective Time. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated
pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.1 of this Agreement, and subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 6, 7 and 8
of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 140 Scott Drive, Menlo Park,
California, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the third
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied
or waived of the conditions set forth in Sections 6, 7 and 8, other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions), or at such
other time, date and place as Tigris and Potomac may mutually agree in
writing. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as
the "Closing Date." At the Closing, the Parties hereto shall cause the Merger
to be consummated by executing and filing with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware a Certificate of Merger with respect to the Merger,
satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL and in a form reasonably
acceptable to Tigris and Potomac (the "Certificate of Merger"). The Merger
shall become effective at the time of the filing of such Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as
may be specified in such Certificate of Merger with the consent of Tigris and
Potomac (the time as of which the Merger becomes effective being referred to
as the "Effective Time").

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. At the
Effective Time:

 (a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to read identically to the Certificate of
Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and such Certificate of
Incorporation;

(b) the Certificate of Incorporation of Tigris shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of Tigris immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and such Certificate of
Incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Tigris shall
file an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to change the name of
Tigris to "Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;" and to make such other changes as
are mutually agreeable to Tigris and Potomac;

(c) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in
their entirety to read identically to the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided
by the DGCL and such Bylaws;

(d) the directors and officers of Tigris shall be as set forth in Section
5.17; and

(e) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, shall be the directors and officers of Tigris as set
forth in Section 5.17, after giving effect to the provisions of Section 5.17.

1.5 Conversion of Shares and Issuance of Warrants.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Tigris, Merger Sub, Potomac or any stockholder of
Potomac:

(i) any shares of Potomac Common Stock or Potomac Preferred Stock held as
treasury stock or held or owned by Potomac, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of
Potomac immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor; and

(ii) subject to Section 1.5(c), each share of Potomac Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(i) and excluding Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted solely into the right to receive a number of shares of Tigris Common
Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio.

(b) If any shares of Potomac Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option or the risk
of forfeiture under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or
other agreement with Potomac, then the shares of Tigris Common Stock issued in
exchange for such shares of Potomac Common Stock will to the same extent be
unvested and subject to the same repurchase option or risk of forfeiture, and
the certificates representing such shares of Tigris Common Stock shall
accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. Potomac shall take all actions
that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
Tigris is entitled to exercise any such

 repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement.

(c) No fractional shares of Tigris Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued. Any holder of Potomac Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Tigris Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Tigris Common Stock issuable to such
holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender by such
holder of a letter of transmittal in accordance with Section 1.8 and
accompanying documents as required therein, be paid in cash the dollar amount
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by
multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a share of Tigris Common
Stock on The NASDAQ Global Market (or such other NASDAQ market on which the
Tigris Common Stock then trades) on the date the Merger becomes effective.

(d) All Potomac Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
under the 2014 Plan and all Potomac Warrants outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be exchanged for options to purchase Tigris Common
Stock or warrants to purchase Tigris Common Stock, as applicable, in
accordance with Section 5.5. All other Potomac Options shall be cancelled
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) Each share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing
ownership of any such shares shall, as of the Effective Time, evidence
ownership of such shares of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(f) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Potomac Capital Stock or Tigris Common Stock shall have
been changed into, or exchanged for, a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares,
the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted to provide the holders of
Potomac Common Stock, Potomac Preferred Stock, Potomac Options and Potomac
Warrants the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event.

(g) Immediately following the consummation of the Merger, Tigris shall file a
certificate of merger for the Second Merger (the "Second Step Certificate of
Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in a form
reasonably acceptable to each of Tigris and Potomac and in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA. The Second Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Second Step Certificate of Merger. Each
issued and outstanding share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
shall be cancelled and exchanged for an equivalent percentage of the
membership interests of the Surviving Company, and all of the membership
interests of Merger LLC shall become all of the membership interests of the
Surviving Company.

1.6 Calculation of Net Cash.

 (a) For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Determination Date" shall be the
date that is ten (10) calendar days prior to the anticipated date for Closing,
as agreed upon by Tigris and Potomac at least ten (10) calendar days prior to
the Tigris Stockholders' Meeting (the "Anticipated Closing Date"). Within five
(5) calendar days following the Determination Date, Tigris shall deliver to
Potomac a schedule (the "Net Cash Schedule") setting forth, in reasonable
detail, Tigris' good faith, estimated calculation of Net Cash (using an
estimate of Tigris' accounts payable and accrued expenses, in each case as of
the Anticipated Closing Date and determined in a manner substantially
consistent with the manner in which such items were determined for Tigris'
most recent SEC filings) (the "Net Cash Calculation") as of the Anticipated
Closing Date prepared and certified by Tigris' Chief Financial Officer. Tigris
shall make the work papers and back-up materials used or useful in preparing
the Net Cash Schedule, as reasonably requested by Potomac, available to
Potomac and, if requested by Potomac, its accountants and counsel at
reasonable times and upon reasonable notice.

(b) Within three (3) calendar days after Tigris delivers the Net Cash Schedule
(the "Response Date"), Potomac shall have the right to dispute any part of
such Net Cash Schedule by delivering a written notice to that effect to Tigris
(a "Dispute Notice"). Any Dispute Notice shall identify in reasonable detail
the nature of any proposed revisions to the Net Cash Calculation.

(c) If on or prior to the Response Date, (i) Potomac notifies Tigris in
writing that it has no objections to the Net Cash Calculation or (ii) Potomac
fails to deliver a Dispute Notice as provided in Section 1.6(b), then the Net
Cash Calculation as set forth in the Net Cash Schedule shall be deemed to have
been finally determined for purposes of this Agreement and to represent the
Net Cash at the Determination Date for purposes of this Agreement.

(d) If Potomac delivers a Dispute Notice on or prior to the Response Date,
then Representatives of Tigris and Potomac shall promptly meet and attempt in
good faith to resolve the disputed item(s) and negotiate an agreed-upon
determination of Net Cash, which agreed upon Net Cash amount shall be deemed
to have been finally determined for purposes of this Agreement and to
represent the Net Cash at the Determination Date for purposes of this
Agreement.

(e) If Representatives of Tigris and Potomac are unable to negotiate an
agreed-upon determination of Net Cash at the Determination Date pursuant to
Section 1.6(d) within three (3) calendar days after delivery of the Dispute
Notice (or such other period as Tigris and Potomac may mutually agree upon),
then Tigris and Potomac shall jointly select an independent auditor of
recognized national standing (the "Accounting Firm") to resolve any remaining
disagreements as to the Net Cash Calculation. Tigris shall promptly deliver to
the Accounting Firm the work papers and back-up materials used in preparing
the Net Cash Schedule, and Tigris and Potomac shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to make its determination
within ten (10) calendar days of accepting its selection. Potomac and Tigris
shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the Accounting Firm any
material related to the unresolved disputes and to discuss the issues with the
Accounting Firm; provided, however, that no such presentation or discussion
shall occur without

 the presence of a Representative of each of Potomac and Tigris. The
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be limited to the disagreements
submitted to the Accounting Firm. The determination of the amount of Net Cash
made by the Accounting Firm shall be deemed to have been finally determined
for purposes of this Agreement and to represent the Net Cash at the
Determination Date for purposes of this Agreement, and the Parties shall delay
the Closing until the resolution of the matters described in this Section
1.6(e). The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated
between Tigris and Potomac in the same proportion that the disputed amount of
the Net Cash that was unsuccessfully disputed by such Party (as finally
determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total disputed amount of the
Net Cash amount. If this Section 1.6(e) applies as to the determination of the
Net Cash at the Determination Date described in Section 1.6(a), upon
resolution of the matter in accordance with this Section 1.6(e), the Parties
shall not be required to determine Net Cash again even though the Closing Date
may occur later than the Anticipated Closing Date, unless the Closing Date is
more than fifteen (15) calendar days after the Anticipated Closing Date.

1.7 Closing of Potomac's Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a) all shares
of Potomac Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be treated in accordance with Section 1.5(a), and all holders of
certificates representing shares of Potomac Common Stock and Potomac Preferred
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights as stockholders of Potomac; and (b) the stock
transfer books of Potomac shall be closed with respect to all shares of
Potomac Common Stock and Potomac Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Potomac
Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously
representing any shares of Potomac Common Stock, including any valid
certificate representing any shares of Potomac Preferred Stock previously
converted into shares of Potomac Common Stock in connection with the Preferred
Stock Conversion, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
"Potomac Stock Certificate") is presented to the Exchange Agent or to the
Surviving Corporation, such Potomac Stock Certificate shall be canceled and
shall be exchanged as provided in Sections 1.5 and 1.8.

1.8 Surrender of Certificates.

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Tigris and Potomac shall agree upon and
select a reputable bank, transfer agent or trust company to act as exchange
agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). At the Effective Time, Tigris
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent: (i) certificates representing the
shares of Tigris Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.5(a) and (ii)
cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with Section 1.5(c). The shares of Tigris Common Stock and cash amounts so
deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or
distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares, are
referred to collectively as the "Exchange Fund."

(b) At or before the Effective Time, Potomac will deliver to Tigris a true,
complete and accurate listing of all record holders of Potomac Stock
Certificates at the Effective Time, including the number and class of shares
of Potomac's capital stock held by such record

 holder, and the number of shares of Tigris Common Stock such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5. Promptly after the Effective
Time, the Parties shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the Persons who
were record holders of Potomac Stock Certificates immediately prior to the
Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing
such provisions as Tigris may reasonably specify (including a provision
confirming that delivery of Potomac Stock Certificates shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to Potomac Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of such Potomac Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent); and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of Potomac Stock Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing Tigris Common Stock. Upon surrender of
a Potomac Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with
a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Tigris: (A) the holder of such
Potomac Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing the number of whole shares of Tigris Common Stock
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
Section 1.5(a) (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Tigris Common
Stock pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5(c)); and (B) the Potomac Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 1.8(b), each Potomac Stock Certificate shall be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive shares of Tigris Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional
share of Tigris Common Stock). If any Potomac Stock Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, Tigris may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the delivery of any shares of Tigris Common Stock,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Potomac Stock Certificate
to provide an applicable affidavit with respect to such Potomac Stock
Certificate and post a bond indemnifying Tigris against any claim suffered by
Tigris related to the lost, stolen or destroyed Potomac Stock Certificate or
any Tigris Common Stock issued in exchange therefor as Tigris may reasonably
request.

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Tigris Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Potomac Stock Certificate with respect to
the shares of Tigris Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in
the Merger until such holder surrenders such Potomac Stock Certificate or an
affidavit of loss or destruction in lieu thereof in accordance with this
Section 1.8 (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the
effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, to receive
all such dividends and distributions, without interest).

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Potomac Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days after the Closing Date
shall be delivered to Tigris upon demand, and any holders of Potomac Stock
Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Potomac Stock
Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.8 shall thereafter look only to
Tigris for satisfaction of their claims for Tigris Common Stock, cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Tigris Common Stock and any dividends or distributions
with respect to shares of Tigris Common Stock.

(e) Each of the Exchange Agent, Tigris and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration deliverable pursuant to
this Agreement to

 any holder of any Potomac Stock Certificate such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or under any other
applicable Legal Requirement and shall be entitled to request any reasonably
appropriate Tax forms, including Form W-9 (or the appropriate Form W-8, as
applicable) from any recipient of payments hereunder. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, and remitted to the appropriate taxing
authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

(f) No party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of any Potomac
Stock Certificate or to any other Person with respect to any shares of Tigris
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or for any
cash amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.

1.9 Appraisal Rights.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Potomac Capital Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and which are held by stockholders who have exercised and perfected
appraisal rights for such shares of Potomac Capital Stock in accordance with
the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into
or represent the right to receive the per share amount of the merger
consideration described in Section 1.5 attributable to such Dissenting Shares.
Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such shares of Potomac Capital Stock held by them in accordance with the
DGCL, unless and until such stockholders fail to perfect or effectively
withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under the DGCL. All
Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their right to appraisal of such
shares of Potomac Capital Stock under the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to be
converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive the per share amount of the merger consideration
attributable to such Dissenting Shares upon their surrender in the manner
provided in Section 1.5.

(b) Potomac shall give Tigris prompt written notice of any demands by
dissenting stockholders received by Potomac, withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served on Potomac and any material correspondence
received by Potomac in connection with such demands.

1.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by the Surviving Corporation to be necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Potomac, then the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be fully authorized, and shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts (in the name of Potomac, in the name of Merger Sub and
otherwise) to take such action.

1.11 Tax Consequences. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger and the
Second Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction for
United States federal income

 Tax purposes, is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. The parties to this Agreement adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the Treasury
Regulations.

Section 2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF POTOMAC

Potomac represents and warrants to Tigris and Merger Sub as follows, except as
set forth in the written disclosure schedule delivered by Potomac to Tigris
(the "Potomac Disclosure Schedule"). The Potomac Disclosure Schedule shall be
arranged in sections and subsections corresponding to the numbered and
lettered sections and subsections contained in this Section 2. The disclosures
in any section or subsection of the Potomac Disclosure Schedule shall qualify
other sections and subsections in this Section 2 to the extent it is
reasonably clear from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to such other sections and subsections. The inclusion of any
information in the Potomac Disclosure Schedule (or any update thereto) shall
not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that
such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material,
has resulted in or would result in a Potomac Material Adverse Effect, or is
outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

2.1 Subsidiaries; Due Organization; Etc.

(a) Potomac has no Subsidiaries, except for the Entities identified in Part

(c) Each of Potomac and the Potomac Subsidiaries is qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing, under the laws of all
jurisdictions where the nature of its business requires such qualification
other than in jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified individually
or in the aggregate would not be reasonably expected to have a Potomac
Material Adverse Effect.

2.2 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Charters and Codes of Conduct.
Potomac has delivered to Tigris accurate and complete copies of the
certificate of incorporation,

Potomac or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no outstanding or authorized
stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation or other similar

accounting controls utilized by Potomac and the Potomac Subsidiaries, (ii) any

materials) free and clear of any Encumbrances (other than those Encumbrances
which would not materially limit the business of Potomac as conducted or
planned to be conducted). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

(i) All documents and instruments necessary to register or apply for or renew
registration of Potomac Registered IP have been validly executed, delivered,
and filed in a timely manner with the appropriate Governmental Body except for
any such failure, individually or collectively, that would not reasonably be
expected to have a Potomac Material Adverse Effect.

(ii) Each Person who is or was an employee or contractor of Potomac or any
Potomac Subsidiary and who is or was involved in the creation or development
of any Potomac IP Rights has signed a valid, enforceable agreement containing
an assignment of such Intellectual Property to Potomac or such Subsidiary and
confidentiality provisions protecting trade secrets and confidential
information of Potomac and its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Potomac and
its Subsidiaries, no current or former stockholder, officer, director, or
employee of Potomac or any of its Subsidiaries has any claim, right (whether
or not currently exercisable), or interest to or in any Potomac IP Rights. To
the Knowledge of Potomac and its Subsidiaries, no employee of Potomac or any
or any Potomac Subsidiary is (a) bound by or otherwise subject to any Contract
restricting him or her from performing his or her duties for Potomac or such
Subsidiary or (b) in breach of any Contract with any former employer or other
Person concerning Potomac IP Rights or confidentiality provisions protecting
trade secrets and confidential information comprising Potomac IP Rights.

(iii) No funding, facilities, or personnel of any Governmental Body were used,
directly or indirectly, to develop or create, in whole or in part, any Potomac
IP Rights in which Potomac or any of its Subsidiaries has an ownership
interest.

(iv) Potomac and each of its Subsidiaries has taken reasonable steps to
maintain the confidentiality of and otherwise protect and enforce its rights
in all proprietary information that Potomac or such Subsidiary holds, or
purports to hold, as a trade secret.

transferred ownership of, or agreed to assign or otherwise transfer ownership
of, any Potomac IP Rights to any other Person.

(vi) To the Knowledge of Potomac and its Subsidiaries, the Potomac IP Rights
constitute all Intellectual Property necessary for Potomac and its
Subsidiaries to conduct its business as currently conducted and planned to be
conducted.

(f) Potomac has delivered, or made available to Tigris, a complete and
accurate copy of all Potomac IP Rights Agreements. Neither Potomac nor any
Potomac Subsidiary is a party to any Contract (A) pursuant to which the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions will constitute a breach, or (B) as a result of
such execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions will cause the forfeiture or
termination of or Encumbrance upon, or the grant of any license or other right
to, or give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of or Encumbrance
upon, any Potomac IP Rights or impair the right of Potomac or the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to use, sell or license any Potomac IP Rights
or portion thereof, except for the occurrence of any such breach, forfeiture,
termination, Encumbrance, grant or impairment that would not individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Potomac Material
Adverse Effect. With respect to each of the Potomac IP Rights Agreements: (i)
each such agreement is valid and binding on Potomac or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and in full force and effect; (ii) Potomac has not received any
written notice of termination or cancellation under such agreement, or
received any written notice of breach or default under such agreement, which
breach has not been cured or waived; and (iii) neither Potomac nor its
Subsidiaries, and to the Knowledge of Potomac, no other party to any such
agreement, is in breach or default thereof in any material respect.

(g) The manufacture, marketing, license, sale or intended use of any product
or technology currently licensed or sold or under development by Potomac or
any of its Subsidiaries does not violate any license or agreement between
Potomac or its Subsidiaries and any third party, and, to the Knowledge of
Potomac and its Subsidiaries, does not infringe or misappropriate any
Intellectual Property right of any other party, which infringement or
misappropriation would reasonably be expected to have a Potomac Material
Adverse Effect. Potomac has disclosed in correspondence to Tigris the third-
party patents and patent applications found during all freedom to operate
searches that were conducted by Potomac or its Subsidiaries related to any
product or technology currently licensed or sold or under development by
Potomac or its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Potomac and its Subsidiaries,
no third party is infringing upon, or violating any license or agreement with
Potomac or its Subsidiaries relating to any Potomac IP Rights. There is no
current or pending challenge, claim or Legal Proceeding (including, but not
limited to, opposition, interference or other proceeding in any patent or
other government office) contesting the validity, ownership or right to use,
sell, license or dispose of any Potomac IP Rights, nor has Potomac or any of
its Subsidiaries received any written notice asserting that any Potomac IP
Rights or the proposed use, sale, license or disposition thereof conflicts
with or infringes or misappropriates or will conflict with or infringe or
misappropriate the rights of any other Person.

 (h) Each item of Potomac IP Rights that is Potomac Registered IP is and at all
times has been filed and maintained in compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements and all filings, payments, and other actions required to be made
or taken to maintain such item of Potomac Registered IP in full force and
effect have been made by the applicable deadline, except for any failure to
perform any of the foregoing, individually or collectively, that would not
reasonably be expected to have a Potomac Material Adverse Effect.

(i) To the Knowledge of Potomac and its Subsidiaries, no trademark (whether
registered or unregistered) or trade name owned, used, or applied for by
Potomac or any of its Subsidiaries conflicts or interferes with any trademark
(whether registered or unregistered) or trade name owned, used, or applied for
by any other Person. None of the goodwill associated with or inherent in any
trademark (whether registered or unregistered) in which Potomac or any of its
Subsidiaries has or purports to have an ownership interest has been impaired
as determined by Potomac or any of its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP.

(j) Except as set forth in Parts 2.8(c) or 2.8(d) of the Potomac Disclosure
Schedule (i) neither Potomac nor any of its Subsidiaries is bound by any
Contract to indemnify, defend, hold harmless, or reimburse any other Person
with respect to any Intellectual Property infringement, misappropriation, or
similar claim, and (ii) neither Potomac nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever
assumed, or agreed to discharge or otherwise take responsibility for, any
existing or potential liability of another Person for infringement,
misappropriation, or violation of any Intellectual Property right, which
assumption, agreement or responsibility remains in force as of the date of
this Agreement.

Knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement has any other party to a Potomac
Material Contract, breached, violated or defaulted under, or received notice
that it has breached, violated or defaulted under, any of the terms or

or its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound of the type described

a "Potomac Material Contract") in such manner as would permit any other party
to cancel or terminate any such Potomac Material Contract, or would permit any
other party to seek damages which would reasonably be expected to have a
Potomac Material Adverse Effect. As to Potomac and its Subsidiaries, as of the
date of this Agreement, each Potomac Material Contract is valid, binding,
enforceable and in full force and effect, subject to: (i) laws of general
application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors; and
(ii) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other
equitable remedies. The consummation of the Contemplated Transactions shall
not result in any material payment or payments becoming due from Potomac, any
Potomac Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or Tigris to any Person under
any Potomac Contract or give any Person the right to terminate or alter the
provisions of any Potomac Contract. No Person is renegotiating, or has a right
pursuant to the terms of any Potomac Material Contract to change, any material
amount paid or payable to Potomac under any Potomac Material Contract or any
other material term or provision of any Potomac Material Contract.

Subsidiary has any liability, indebtedness, obligation, expense, claim,

Governmental Body or authority indicated to Potomac an

 intention to conduct the same. There is no agreement, judgment, injunction,

Potomac Subsidiary is in material compliance with the terms of the Potomac
Permits. No action, proceeding, revocation proceeding, amendment procedure,

"Potomac Regulatory Permits") and no such Potomac Regulatory Permit has been
(i) revoked, withdrawn, suspended, cancelled or terminated or (ii) modified in
any adverse manner, other than immaterial adverse modifications. Potomac and
each Potomac Subsidiary is in compliance in all material respects with the

has received any notices, correspondence, or other communications from any
Drug Regulatory Agency requiring, or to the Knowledge of Potomac, threatening
to initiate, the termination or suspension of any clinical studies conducted
by or on behalf of, or sponsored by, Potomac or any of its Subsidiaries or in
which Potomac or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective current products
or product candidates, including the Potomac Product Candidates, have
participated.

(f) Neither Potomac nor any of the Potomac Subsidiaries is the subject of any
pending, or to the Knowledge of Potomac or the Potomac Subsidiaries,
threatened investigation in respect of its business or products by the FDA
pursuant to its "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and
Illegal Gratuities" Final Policy set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September
10, 1991) and any amendments thereto. To the Knowledge of Potomac or any of
the Potomac Subsidiaries, neither Potomac nor any of the Potomac Subsidiaries

in each case in respect of its business or products that would violate the
FDA's "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal
Gratuities" Final Policy, and any amendments thereto. None of Potomac, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, employees or agents has
been convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct that could result in a
debarment or exclusion (i) under 21 U.S.C. Section 335a or (ii) any similar
applicable Legal Requirement. To the Knowledge of Potomac, no debarment or
exclusionary claims, actions, proceedings or investigations in respect of
their business or products are pending or threatened against Potomac, any
Potomac Subsidiary or any of their respective officers, employees or agents.

2.12 Tax Matters.

(a) Potomac and each Potomac Subsidiary have timely filed all federal income
Tax Returns and other material Tax Returns that they were required to file
under applicable Legal Requirements. All such Tax Returns were correct and
complete in all material respects and have been prepared in material
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. Neither Potomac nor any
Potomac Subsidiary is currently the beneficiary of any extension of

 time within which to file any Tax Return. No claim has ever been made by an
authority in a jurisdiction where Potomac or any Potomac Subsidiary does not
file Tax Returns that it is subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

(b) All material Taxes due and owing by Potomac or any Potomac Subsidiary on
or before the date hereof (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been

Potomac nor any Potomac Subsidiary has incurred any Liability for Taxes
outside the Ordinary Course of Business or otherwise inconsistent with past

(e) No deficiencies for Taxes with respect to Potomac or any Potomac
Subsidiary have been claimed, proposed or assessed by any Governmental Body in

audits, assessments or other actions for or relating to any liability in

Taxes of Potomac or any Potomac Subsidiary were raised by the relevant Tax
authority in any completed audit or examination that would reasonably be
expected to result in a material amount of Taxes in a later taxable period.

each Potomac Subsidiary (and predecessors of each) for all taxable years
remaining open under the applicable statute of limitations, and complete and
accurate copies of all examination reports and statements of deficiencies
assessed against or agreed to by Potomac and each Potomac Subsidiary (and
predecessors of each), with respect to federal income Tax and all other
material Taxes. Neither Potomac nor any Potomac Subsidiary (or any of their
predecessors) has waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency, nor has any request been made in writing for any such extension or
waiver.

Potomac Subsidiary as of the date hereof, to the extent such elections are not
shown on or in the Tax Returns that have been delivered or made available to

respect to, any such plan. No Potomac Employee Plan is a Multiemployer Plan,
and neither Potomac nor any Potomac Subsidiary or Potomac Affiliate has ever
contributed to or had an obligation to contribute, or incurred any liability
in respect of a contribution, to any Multiemployer Plan. No Potomac Employee
Plan is a Multiple Employer Plan.

 (k) No Potomac Employee Plan provides for medical or death benefits beyond
termination of service or retirement, other than (i) pursuant to COBRA or an
analogous state law requirement or (ii) death or retirement benefits under a
Potomac Employee Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

(l) Neither Potomac nor any Potomac Subsidiary is a party to any Contract that
has resulted or would reasonably be expected to result, separately or in the
aggregate, in the payment of (i) any "excess parachute payment" within the
meaning of section 280G of the Code and (ii) any amount the deduction for
which would be disallowed under Section 162(m) of the Code.

(m) To the Knowledge of Potomac, no payment pursuant to any Potomac Employee
Plan or other arrangement to any "service provider" (as such term is defined
in Section 409A of the Code and the United States Treasury Regulations and IRS
guidance thereunder) to Potomac or any Potomac Subsidiary, including the
grant, vesting or exercise of any stock option, would subject any Person to
tax pursuant to Section 409A(1) of the Code, whether pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise.

(n) Potomac and each of its Subsidiaries has complied with all state and
federal laws applicable to employees, including but not limited to COBRA,
FMLA, CFRA, HIPAA, the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, the
Newborn's and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996, and any similar
provisions of state law applicable to its employees. To the extent required
under HIPAA and the regulations issued thereunder, Potomac and each of its
Subsidiaries has, prior to the Closing Date, performed all obligations under
the medical privacy rules of HIPAA (45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 164), the
electronic data interchange requirements of HIPAA (45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and
162), and the security requirements of HIPAA (45 C.F.R. Part 142). Neither
Potomac nor any of its Subsidiaries has any unsatisfied obligations to any
employees or qualified beneficiaries pursuant to COBRA, HIPAA or any state law
governing health care coverage or extension.

(o) Potomac and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable
foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations respecting
employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, worker
classification, tax withholding, prohibited discrimination, equal employment,
fair employment practices, meal and rest periods, immigration status, employee
safety and health, wages (including overtime wages), compensation, and hours
of work, and in each case, with respect to employees: (i) has withheld and
reported all amounts required by law or by agreement to be withheld and
reported with respect to wages, salaries and other payments to employees, (ii)
is not liable for any arrears of wages, severance pay or any Taxes or any

liable for any payment to any trust or other fund governed by or maintained by
or on behalf of any governmental authority, with respect to unemployment
compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or obligations for
employees (other than routine payments to be made in the normal course of
business and consistent with past practice). There are no actions, suits,
claims or administrative matters pending, threatened or reasonably anticipated
against Potomac or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any employee,
employment

 agreement or Potomac Employee Plan. There are no pending or threatened or
reasonably anticipated claims or actions against Potomac, any of its
Subsidiaries, any Potomac trustee or any trustee of any Subsidiary under any
worker's compensation policy or long-term disability policy. Neither Potomac
nor any Subsidiary thereof is party to a conciliation agreement, consent
decree or other agreement or order with any federal, state, or local agency or
governmental authority with respect to employment practices.

(p) Part 2.13(p) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all liabilities of Potomac
or any of its Subsidiaries to any employee, that result from the termination
by Potomac or any of its Subsidiaries of such employee's employment or
provision of services, a change of control of Potomac, or a combination
thereof. Neither Potomac nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
liability with respect to any misclassification of: (a) any Person as an
independent contractor rather than as an employee, (b) any employee leased
from another employer, or (c) any employee currently or formerly classified as
exempt from overtime wages. Neither Potomac nor any Subsidiary has taken any
action which would constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" within the
meaning of the WARN Act or similar state or local law, issued any notification
of a plant closing or mass layoff required by the WARN Act or similar state or
local law, or incurred any liability or obligation under WARN or any similar
state or local law that remains unsatisfied. No terminations of employees of
Potomac or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing would trigger any
notice or other obligations under the WARN Act or similar state or local law.

(q) With respect to each Potomac Employee Plan, Potomac has made available to
Tigris a true and complete copy of, to the extent applicable, (i) such Potomac
Employee Plan, (ii) the three (3) most recent annual reports (Form 5500) as

with respect to any Potomac Employee Plan.

2.14 Environmental Matters. Potomac and each Potomac Subsidiary is in
compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, which compliance includes
the possession by Potomac of all permits and other Governmental Authorizations
required under applicable Environmental Laws and compliance with the terms and
conditions thereof. Neither Potomac nor any Potomac Subsidiary has received
since January 1, 2010 any written notice or other communication (in writing or
otherwise), whether from a Governmental Body, citizens group, employee or
otherwise, that alleges that Potomac or any Potomac Subsidiary is not in
compliance with any Environmental Law, and, to the Knowledge of Potomac, there
are no circumstances that may prevent or interfere with Potomac's or any of
its Subsidiaries' compliance with any Environmental Law in the future. To the
Knowledge of Potomac: (i) no current or prior owner of any property leased or
controlled by Potomac or any of its Subsidiaries has received since January 1,
2010 any written notice or other communication relating to property owned or

(f) Since January 1, 2010, there have been no formal internal investigations
regarding financial reporting or accounting policies and practices discussed
with, reviewed by or initiated at the direction of the chief executive officer
or chief financial officer of Tigris, Tigris'

 Board of Directors or any committee thereof, other than ordinary course audits
or reviews of accounting policies and practices or internal controls required
by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(g) Tigris is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and governance
rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Global Market.

(h) Tigris and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and
procedures sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) that Tigris and its
Subsidiaries maintain records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect Tigris' and its Subsidiaries' transactions and dispositions of assets,
(ii) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (iii) that receipts and
expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
Tigris' Board of Directors, and (iv) regarding prevention or timely detection
of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Tigris' and its
Subsidiaries' assets that could have a material effect on Tigris' consolidated
financial statements. Tigris has evaluated the effectiveness of Tigris' and
its Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting and, to the extent
required by applicable law, presented in any applicable Tigris SEC Document
that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q (or any amendment thereto) its
conclusions about the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment
based on such evaluation. Tigris has disclosed to Tigris' auditors and the
Audit Committee of Tigris' Board of Directors (and made available to Potomac a
summary of the significant aspects of such disclosure) (A) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Tigris' ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Tigris' or its
Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting. Except as disclosed
in the Tigris SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, Tigris has not
identified any material weaknesses in the design or operation of the Tigris or
its Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting. Since December
31, 2013, there have been no material changes in Tigris and its Subsidiaries'
internal control over financial reporting.

(i) Tigris' and its Subsidiaries' "disclosure controls and procedures" (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by Tigris in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such information is accumulated and communicated to Tigris' management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the Certifications.

upon, any Tigris IP Rights or impair the right of Tigris, any of its
Subsidiaries, or the Surviving Corporation to use, sell or license any Tigris
IP Rights or portion thereof, except for the occurrence of any such breach,
forfeiture, termination, Encumbrance, grant or impairment that would not

Agreements: (i) each such agreement is valid and binding on Tigris or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect; (ii) neither Tigris
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of termination or

other party to seek damages which would reasonably be expected to have a
Tigris Material Adverse Effect. The consummation of the Contemplated

No investigation, claim, suit, proceeding, audit or other action by any
Governmental Body or authority is pending or, to the Knowledge of Tigris,
threatened against Tigris or a Tigris Subsidiary, nor has any Governmental
Body or authority indicated to Potomac an intention to conduct the same. There

its products or product candidates (the "Tigris Product Candidates") (the
"Tigris Regulatory Permits") and no such Tigris Regulatory Permit has been (i)
revoked, withdrawn, suspended, cancelled or terminated or (ii) modified in any
materially adverse manner. Neither Tigris nor its Subsidiaries has received
any written notice or other written communication from any Drug Regulatory

under applicable Legal Requirements. All such Tax Returns were correct and
complete in all material respects and have been prepared in material
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. Neither Tigris nor any of
its Subsidiaries is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within

jurisdiction where Tigris or any Tigris Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns
that it is subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

(b) All material Taxes due and owing by Tigris or any of its Subsidiaries on
or before the date hereof (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been

Subsidiaries has incurred any Liability for Taxes outside the Ordinary Course
of Business or otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice.

required to have been withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid or

payable or Taxes that are being contested in good faith and for which adequate
reserves have been made on Tigris' Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet) upon any
of the assets of Tigris or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) No deficiencies for Taxes with respect to Tigris or any of its
Subsidiaries have been claimed, proposed or assessed by any Governmental Body
in writing. There are no pending (or, based on written notice, threatened)
audits, assessments or other actions for or relating to any liability in
respect of Taxes of Tigris or any of its Subsidiaries. No issues relating to
Taxes of Tigris or any of its Subsidiaries were raised by the relevant Tax
authority in any completed audit or examination that would reasonably be
expected to result in a material amount of Taxes in a later taxable period.

of all federal income Tax and all other material Tax Returns of Tigris (and
its Subsidiaries and predecessors) for all taxable years remaining open under
the applicable statute of limitations, and complete and accurate copies of all
examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed
to by Tigris (and its Subsidiaries and predecessors), with respect to federal
income Tax and all other material Taxes. Tigris (or any of its Subsidiaries or
predecessors) has not waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency, nor has any request been made in writing for any such extension or
waiver.

Tigris Subsidiary as of the date hereof, to the extent such elections are not
shown on or in the Tax Returns that have been delivered or made available to

or will make a consent dividend election under Section 565 of the Code; (vi)
has not elected at any time to be treated as an S corporation within the

any comparable provision of state, local or foreign law.

(g) Neither Tigris nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a United States real
property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the

arrangements), other than commercial contracts entered into in the Ordinary
Course of Business with vendors, customers and landlords.

affiliated group filing a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return (other

Liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than Tigris and its Subsidiaries)
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by Contract, or
otherwise.

(j) Neither Tigris nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed stock of
another Person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person, in a
transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part
by Section 355 of the Code or Section 361 of the Code.

with respect to any joint venture, partnership, or, to the Knowledge of
Tigris, other arrangement or contract which is treated as a partnership for
Tax purposes.

item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for
any period (or any portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result
of any (i) installment sale or other open transaction disposition made on or
prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) agreement with any Tax authority (including
any closing agreement described in Section 7121 of the Code or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law) made or entered into on or prior to
the Closing Date.

 (m) Neither Tigris nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any
transaction identified as a "listed transaction" for purposes of Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.6011-4(b)(2) or 301.6111-2(b)(2).

(n) Neither Tigris nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action, nor has
any knowledge of any fact or circumstance, that could reasonably be expected
to prevent the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the
Second Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction for

assistance program, education or tuition assistance programs and other similar
fringe or employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements, including any
employment or executive compensation or severance agreements, written or
otherwise, which are currently in effect relating to any present or former
employee or director of Tigris (or any trade or business (whether or not
incorporated) which is a Tigris Affiliate) or which is maintained by,
administered or contributed to by, or required to be contributed to by,
Tigris, or any Tigris Affiliate, or under which Tigris or any Tigris Affiliate
has incurred or may incur any liability (each, an "Tigris Employee Plan").
Part 3.11(c) of the Tigris Disclosure Schedule sets forth all amounts owed to

material respects, with its terms and, both as to form and operation, with all

Employee Plan is a Multiemployer Plan, and neither Tigris nor any Tigris
Affiliate has ever contributed to or had an obligation to contribute, or
incurred any liability in respect of a contribution, to any Multiemployer
Plan. No Tigris Employee Plan is a Multiple Employer Plan.

or an analogous state law requirement or (ii) death or retirement benefits
under an Tigris Employee Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

(i) With respect to Tigris Options granted pursuant to the Tigris Stock Plans,
(i) each Tigris Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option"
under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies, (ii) each grant of a Tigris Option

necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the board of
directors of Tigris (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof)

written consents, and the award agreement governing such grant (if any) was
duly executed and delivered by each party thereto, (iii) each Tigris Option
grant was made in accordance with the terms of the Tigris Stock Plans, the
Exchange Act and all other applicable laws and regulatory rules or
requirements, including the rules of the Nasdaq Global Market and any other
exchange on which Tigris securities are traded, (iv) the per share exercise
price of each Tigris Option was equal to the fair market value of a share of
Tigris Common Stock on the applicable Grant Date and (v) each such Tigris

Tigris filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with
the Exchange Act and all other applicable laws. Tigris has not knowingly
granted, and there is no and has been no policy or practice of Tigris of
granting, Tigris Options prior to, or otherwise coordinate the grant of Tigris
Options with, the release or other public announcement of material information
regarding Tigris or its results of operations or prospects.

 (j) To the Knowledge of Tigris, no Tigris Options, stock appreciation rights
or other equity-based awards issued or granted by Tigris are subject to the
requirements of Code Section 409A. To the Knowledge of Tigris, each
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as such term is defined under
Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code and the guidance thereunder) under which Tigris
or any of its Subsidiaries makes, is obligated to make or promises to make,
payments (each, a "409A Plan") complies in all material respects, in both form
and operation, with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the guidance
thereunder. No payment to be made under any 409A Plan is, or to the Knowledge
of Tigris will be, subject to the penalties of Code Section 409A(a)(1).

(k) Tigris and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all of its
bonus, commission and other compensation plans and has paid any and all
amounts required to be paid under such plans, including any and all bonuses
and commissions (or pro rata portion thereof) that may have accrued or been
earned through the calendar quarter preceding the Effective Time, and is not
liable for any payments, taxes or penalties for failure to comply with any of
the terms or conditions of such plans or the laws governing such plans.

(l) Tigris and each of its Subsidiaries has complied with all state and
federal laws applicable to employees, including but not limited to COBRA,
FMLA, CFRA, HIPAA, the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, the

its Subsidiaries has any unsatisfied obligations to any of its employees or
qualified beneficiaries pursuant to COBRA, HIPAA or any state law governing
health care coverage or extension.

(m) Tigris and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable
foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations respecting
employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, worker

claims or administrative matters pending, threatened or reasonably anticipated
against Tigris or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any employee, employment
agreement or Tigris Employee Plan. There are no pending or threatened or
reasonably anticipated claims or actions against Tigris, any of its
Subsidiaries, any Tigris trustee or any trustee of any Subsidiary under any
worker's compensation policy or long-term disability policy. Neither Tigris
nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to a conciliation agreement, consent
decree or other agreement or order with any federal, state, or local agency or
governmental authority with respect to employment practices. Part 3.11(m) of
the Disclosure Schedule lists all liabilities of Tigris or any of its
Subsidiaries to any of their respective employees that result from the
termination by Tigris

 or any of its Subsidiaries of such employee's employment or provision of
services, a change of control of Tigris, or a combination thereof. Neither
Tigris nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability with respect to

than as an employee, (b) any employee leased from another employer, or (c) any
employee currently or formerly classified as exempt from overtime wages.

constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" within the meaning of the WARN
Act or similar state or local law, issued any notification of a plant closing
or mass layoff required by the WARN Act or similar state or local law, or
incurred any liability or obligation under WARN or any similar state or local
law that remains unsatisfied. No terminations of employees of Tigris or any of
its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing would trigger any notice or other
obligations under the WARN Act or similar state or local law.

slowdown, work stoppage, lockout, job action, union, organizing activity,
question concerning representation or any similar activity or dispute,
affecting Tigris or any of its Subsidiaries. No event has occurred, and no
condition or circumstance exists, that might directly or indirectly be likely
to give rise to or provide a basis for the commencement of any such strike,
slowdown, work stoppage, lockout, job action, unior organizing activity,
question concerning representation or any similar activity or dispute.

(o) Neither Tigris nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor has been, engaged in
any unfair labor practice within the meaning of the National Labor Relations
Act. There is no Legal Proceeding, claim, labor dispute or grievance pending
or, to the Knowledge of Tigris, threatened or reasonably anticipated relating
to any employment contract, privacy right, labor dispute, wages and hours,
leave of absence, plant closing notification, workers' compensation policy,
long-term disability policy, harassment, retaliation, immigration, employment
statute or regulation, safety or discrimination matter involving any Tigris
Associate, including charges of unfair labor practices or discrimination
complaints.

any Tigris Affiliate is a party or by which it is bound to compensate any of
its employees for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.

the possession by Tigris or a Tigris Subsidiary of all permits and other
Governmental Authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws and
compliance with the terms and conditions thereof. Neither Tigris nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received since January 1, 2010 any written notice or
other communication (in writing or otherwise), whether from a Governmental
Body, citizens group, employee or otherwise, that alleges that Tigris or a
Tigris Subsidiary is not in compliance with

 any Environmental Law, and, to the Knowledge of Tigris, there are no
circumstances that may prevent or interfere with Tigris' or a Tigris
Subsidiary's compliance with any Environmental Law in the future. To the
Knowledge of Tigris: (i) no current or prior owner of any property leased or
controlled by Tigris or a Tigris Subsidiary has received since January 1, 2010
any written notice or other communication relating to property owned or leased

Stockholder Vote, as applicable, each Party may furnish nonpublic information
regarding such Party to, and enter into discussions or negotiations with, any
Person in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, which such
Party's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with a
nationally recognized independent financial advisor, if any, and its outside
legal counsel, constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior
Offer (and is not withdrawn) if: (A) neither such Party nor any Representative
of such Party shall have breached this Section 4.5; (B) the Board of Directors

counsel, that the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result

that, in the event any Representative of such Party (whether or not such

Agreement.

(b) If any Party or any Representative of such Party receives an Acquisition

advise the other Party orally and in writing of such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry (including the identity of the Person making or submitting
such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, and the terms thereof). Such
Party

 shall keep the other Party informed in all material respects with respect to
the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry
and any modification or proposed modification thereto. In addition to the
foregoing, each Party shall provide the other Party with at least five (5)
Business Days' written notice of a meeting of its board of directors (or any
committee thereof) at which its board of directors (or any committee thereof)
is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry it has received.

(c) Each Party shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions, negotiations and communications with any Person that relate to
any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry as of the date of this
Agreement and cause the destruction or return of any nonpublic information
provided to such Person.



4.6 Undisclosed liabilities. In the event that during the Pre-Closing Period,
Potomac identifies a bona fide Liability of Tigris which was not disclosed to
Potomac in this Agreement or in Section 3.8 of the Tigris Disclosure Schedule
and which such Liability is of a nature that would result in a specific
reduction in the amount of Net Cash, Potomac shall provide notice of such bona
fide Liability to Tigris within three (3) Business Days, and Potomac and
Tigris shall promptly meet (no later than three (3) Business Days following
Potomac's notice of such bona fide Liability to Tigris pursuant to this
Section 4.6) and work in good faith to determine a mutually agreed to
estimated amount for such bona fide Liability, which shall represent a good
faith estimate of a reasonable amount of such Liability by Potomac, with the
advice of Potomac's outside legal counsel and/or financial advisers (as
applicable), subject to Tigris's consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, including estimated litigation costs (if any) in connection with
resolving such matter (the "Pre-Closing Liability Amount"). The Pre-Closing
Liability Amount shall be deducted in the determination of Net Cash (without
duplication) pursuant to Section 1.6, if not finally settled prior to the
Closing.

to the stockholders of Tigris, at the time of the Tigris Stockholders' Meeting
and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in

which they were made, not

 misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tigris makes no covenant,
representation or warranty with respect to statements made in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus/Information Statement (and the letter to stockholders,
notice of meeting and form of proxy included therewith), if any, based on
information furnished in writing by Potomac specifically for inclusion
therein. Each of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to

efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus/Information Statement to be
mailed to Tigris' stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each
Party shall promptly furnish to the other Party all information concerning
such Party and such Party's subsidiaries and such Party's stockholders that

if Potomac becomes aware of any information, that should be disclosed in an
amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus/ Information Statement, then Potomac shall promptly
inform Tigris thereof and shall cooperate fully with Tigris in filing such
amendment or supplement with the SEC and, if appropriate, in mailing such
amendment or supplement to the stockholders of Potomac.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Tigris shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals needed to ensure that the Tigris
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger (to the extent required) be registered
or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification under the securities
law of every jurisdiction of the United States in which any registered holder
of Potomac Capital Stock has an address of record on the record date for

Potomac Stockholder Written Consent; provided, however, that Tigris shall not
be required: (i) to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now qualified; or (ii) to file a general
consent to service of process in any jurisdiction.

requested from Potomac to be included in the Form S-4 Registration Statement.

5.2 Potomac Stockholder Written Consent.

(a) Promptly after the S-4 Registration Statement shall have been declared

Business Days thereafter, Potomac shall obtain the approval by written consent
from certain of those Potomac stockholders sufficient for the Required Potomac
Stockholder Vote in lieu of a meeting pursuant to Section 228 of the DGCL,

 Stockholder Support Agreements, for purposes of (i) adopting this Agreement
and approving the Merger, and all other transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Preferred Stock Conversion, (ii) acknowledging that the approval
given thereby is irrevocable and that such stockholder is aware of its rights
to demand appraisal for its shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, a copy
of which was attached thereto, and that such stockholder has received and read
a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL, and (iii) acknowledging that by its
approval of the Merger it is not entitled to appraisal rights with respect to
its shares in connection with the Merger and thereby waives any rights to
receive payment of the fair value of its capital stock under the DGCL. Under
no circumstances shall Potomac assert that any other approval or consent is
necessary by its stockholders to approve the Merger or this Agreement.

(b) Potomac agrees that, subject to Section 5.2(c): (i) Potomac's Board of
Directors shall recommend that Potomac's stockholders vote to adopt and
approve this Agreement and the Merger and shall use commercially reasonable

any time prior to the approval of this Agreement by the Required Potomac
Stockholder Vote, Potomac's Board of Directors may withhold, amend, withdraw

but only if Potomac's Board of Directors determined in good faith, based on
such matters as it deems relevant following consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to withdraw, withhold, amend, or modify such
recommendation would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Legal Requirements; provided that Tigris receives written notice
from Potomac confirming that Potomac's Board of Directors has determined to
change its recommendation at least five (5) Business Days in advance of the
Potomac Board Recommendation being so withdrawn, withheld, amended or modified
in a manner adverse to Tigris.

(d) Potomac's obligation to solicit the consent of its stockholders to sign
the Potomac Stockholder Written Consent in accordance with Section 5.2(a)

announcement or submission of any Superior Offer or other Acquisition
Proposal, or by any withdrawal or modification of the Potomac Board
Recommendation.

Common Stock in the Merger being referred to as the "Tigris Board
Recommendation"); and (iii) the Tigris Board Recommendation shall not be
withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Potomac, and no resolution by the
Board of Directors of Tigris or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify
the Tigris Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Potomac shall be
adopted or proposed.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(b), at
any time prior to the approval of the issuance of Tigris Common Stock in the
Merger by the stockholders of Tigris by the Required Tigris Stockholder Vote,
Tigris' Board of Directors may withhold, amend, withdraw or modify the Tigris
Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Potomac if, but only if Tigris'
Board of Directors determines in good faith, based on such matters as it deems
relevant following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to withhold, amend, withdraw or modify such recommendation would
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal
Requirements; provided that Potomac receives written notice from Tigris
confirming that Tigris' Board of Directors has determined to change its
recommendation at least five (5) Business Days in advance of the Tigris Board
Recommendation being withdrawn, withheld, amended or modified in a manner

Board of Directors pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) shall be limited to a
statement that Tigris is unable to take a position with respect to the
bidder's tender offer unless Tigris' Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such statement
would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal
Requirements. Tigris shall not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to

(a) Subject to Section 5.5(c), at the Effective Time, each Potomac Option that
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time under
the 2014 Plan, whether or not vested, shall be converted into and become an
option to purchase Tigris Common Stock, and Tigris shall assume the 2014 Plan.
All other Potomac Options shall be cancelled immediately prior to the
Effective Time. All rights with respect to Potomac Common Stock under Potomac
Options assumed by Tigris shall thereupon be converted into rights with
respect to Tigris Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective
Time: (i) each Potomac Option assumed by Tigris may be exercised solely for
shares of Tigris Common Stock; (ii) the number of shares of Tigris Common
Stock subject to each Potomac Option assumed by Tigris shall be determined by
multiplying (A) the number of shares of Potomac Common Stock that were subject
to such Potomac Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (B) the Exchange Ratio and rounding the resulting number down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Tigris Common Stock; (iii) the per share
exercise price for the Tigris Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each
Potomac Option assumed by Tigris shall be determined by dividing (A) the per
share exercise price of Potomac Common Stock subject to such Potomac Option,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (B) the Exchange
Ratio and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent;
and (iv) any restriction on the exercise of any Potomac Option assumed by
Tigris shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability,
vesting schedule and other provisions of such Potomac Option shall otherwise
remain unchanged; provided, however, that: (A) to the extent provided under
the terms of a Potomac Option, such Potomac Option assumed by Tigris in
accordance with this Section 5.5(a) shall, in accordance with its terms, be
subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction with respect to Tigris Common Stock subsequent to the Effective
Time; and (B) Tigris' Board of Directors or a committee thereof shall succeed
to the authority and responsibility of Potomac's Board of Directors or any
committee thereof with respect to each Potomac Option assumed by Tigris.

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5(a), the
conversion of each Potomac Option (regardless of whether such option qualifies
as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code)
into an option to purchase shares of Tigris Common Stock shall be made in a
manner consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.424-1, such that the
conversion of a Potomac Option shall not constitute a "modification" of such
Potomac Option for purposes of Section 409A or Section 424 of the Code.

(b) Tigris shall file with the SEC, no later than 60 days after the Effective
Time, a registration statement on Form S-8, if available for use by Tigris,
relating to the shares of Tigris Common Stock issuable with respect to Potomac
Options assumed by Tigris in accordance with Section 5.5(a).

(c) Subject to Section 5.5(d), at the Effective Time, each Potomac Warrant
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall become converted into and become a warrant to purchase Tigris Common
Stock and Tigris shall assume each such Potomac Warrant in accordance with its
terms. All rights with respect to Potomac Common Stock or Potomac Preferred
Stock under Potomac Warrants assumed by Tigris shall thereupon be converted
into rights with respect to Tigris Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after
the Effective Time: (i) each Potomac Warrant assumed by Tigris may be
exercised solely for shares of Tigris Common Stock; (ii) the number of shares
of Tigris Common Stock subject to each Potomac Warrant assumed by Tigris shall
be determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Potomac Common Stock,
or the number of shares of Potomac Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the shares of Potomac Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of the Potomac
Warrant, as applicable, that were subject to such Potomac Warrant immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio and rounding the
resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Tigris Common
Stock; (iii) the per share exercise price for the Tigris Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of each Potomac Warrant assumed by Tigris shall be determined by
dividing the per share exercise price of Potomac Common Stock or Potomac
Preferred Stock, subject to such Potomac Warrant, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, by the Exchange Ratio and rounding the resulting
exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and (iv) any restriction on any
Potomac Warrant assumed by Tigris shall continue in full force and effect and
the term and other provisions of such Potomac Warrant shall otherwise remain
unchanged.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Potomac shall take all actions that may be
necessary (under the Potomac Stock Option Plans, the Potomac Warrants and
otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 5.5 and to ensure
that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Potomac Options and
Potomac Warrants have no rights with respect thereto other than those
specifically provided in this Section 5.5.

5.6 Employee Benefits. Tigris and Potomac shall cause Tigris to comply with
terms of any employment, severance, retention, change of control, or similar
agreement specified on Part 3.11(c) of the Tigris Disclosure Schedule as being
applicable to this Section 5.6, subject to the provisions of such agreements,
including the maintenance of COBRA insurance for Tigris' former officers and
employees.

 5.7 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, each of Tigris and the Surviving Corporation shall,
jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer of Tigris or Potomac (the "DandO
Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys'
fees and disbursements (collectively, "Costs"), incurred in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that
the DandO Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of Tigris or
Potomac, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL for directors or officers of
Delaware corporations. Each DandO Indemnified Party will be entitled to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation from each of Tigris and the Surviving
Corporation, jointly and severally, upon receipt by Tigris or the Surviving
Corporation from the DandO Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided
that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the
extent then required by the DGCL or the laws of the State of California, as
applicable, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of each of Tigris and the
Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Tigris shall cause the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain,
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of each
of Tigris and Potomac than are presently set forth in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Tigris and Potomac, as applicable, which
provisions shall not be amended, modified or repealed for a period of six
years' time from the Effective Time in a manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time,
were officers or directors of Tigris or Potomac.

(c) Potomac shall negotiate and Tigris shall purchase an insurance policy,
with an effective date as of the Closing, which maintains in effect for six
years from the Closing the current directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies maintained by Potomac (provided that Tigris may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions that are not materially less favorable); provided, however, that in
no event shall Tigris be required to expend pursuant to this Section 5.7(c)
more than an amount equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by Potomac
for such insurance.

(d) Tigris shall maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies, with an effective date as of the Closing, on commercially available
terms and conditions and with coverage limits customary for U.S. public
companies similarly situated to Tigris.

(e) Tigris shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that
may be incurred by the persons referred to in this Section 5.7 in connection
with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 5.7.

 (f) The provisions of this Section 5.7 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current and former officers and directors of
Tigris and Potomac by law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall
operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO
Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives.

(g) In the event Tigris or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Tigris or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.7. Tigris shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation
under this Section 5.7.

5.8 Additional Agreements.

(a) Subject to Section 5.8(b), the Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause to be taken all actions necessary to consummate the Merger
and make effective the other Contemplated Transactions. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, but subject to Section 5.8(b), each Party to this
Agreement: (i) shall make all filings and other submissions (if any) and give
all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such Party in connection
with the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions; (ii) shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) reasonably

force and effect; (iii) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to lift any

or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or transfer any assets; (ii) to
discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any
product or service; (iii) to license or otherwise make available, or cause any
of its Subsidiaries to license or otherwise make available to any Person any

to hold separate any assets or operations (either before or after the Closing
Date); (v) to make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any commitment (to
any Governmental Body or otherwise) regarding its future operations; or (vi)
to contest any Legal Proceeding or any order, writ, injunction or decree
relating to the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions if such
Party determines in good faith that contesting such Legal Proceeding or order,
writ, injunction or decree might not be advisable.

5.9 Disclosure. Without limiting any of either Party's obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, each Party shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Subsidiaries or any Representative of such Party to, issue any press
release or make any disclosure (to any

 customers or employees of such Party, to the public or otherwise) regarding
the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions unless: (a) the other
Party shall have approved such press release or disclosure in writing; or (b)
such Party shall have determined in good faith, upon the advice of outside
legal counsel, that such disclosure is required by applicable Legal
Requirements and, to the extent practicable, before such press release or
disclosure is issued or made, such Party advises the other Party of, and
consults with the other Party regarding, the text of such press release or
disclosure; provided, however, that each of Potomac and Tigris may make any
public statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst
conference calls, so long as any such statements are consistent with previous
press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Potomac or
Tigris in compliance with this Section 5.9.

5.10 Listing. Tigris shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
its existing listing on the NASDAQ Global Market, to obtain approval of the
listing of the combined company on the NASDAQ Global Market and to cause the
shares of Tigris Common Stock being issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing (subject to notice of issuance) on the NASDAQ Global Market at or
prior to the Effective Time.

5.11 Tax Matters.

(a) Tigris, Merger Sub and Potomac shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger and the Second Merger, considered
together as a single integrated transaction for United States federal income
Tax purposes, to qualify, and agree not to, and not to permit or cause any
affiliate or any Subsidiary to, take any actions or cause any action to be
taken which would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger and the Second
Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction for United
States federal income Tax purposes, from qualifying, as a "reorganization"
under Section 368(a) of the Code.

(b) This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties hereto hereby
adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). The Parties shall
treat and shall not take any tax reporting position inconsistent with the
treatment of the Merger and the Second Merger, considered together as a single
integrated transaction for United States federal income Tax purposes, as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for U.S.
federal, state and other relevant Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code.

(c) The parties hereto shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable
efforts in order for Potomac to obtain the opinion of Pepper Hamilton LLP (
"Pepper Hamilton"), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Potomac,
dated as of the Closing (the "Pepper Opinion"), and Tigris to obtain the
opinion of Latham and Watkins LLP ("Latham"), in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Tigris, dated as of the Closing Date (the "Latham Opinion"),
each to the effect that, on the basis of the facts, representations and
assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinions, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, the Merger and the Second Merger, considered together as a
single integrated transaction for United States federal income Tax purposes,
will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of

 the Code. As a condition precedent to the rendering of such opinions, Tigris,
Merger Sub, Merger LLC and Potomac shall, as of the Closing Date, execute and
deliver to Pepper Hamilton and Latham tax representation letters, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Latham, Pepper Hamilton, Tigris and Potomac
(the "Tax Representation Letters"), dated and executed as of the dates of such
opinions, on which such Tax Representation Letters Latham and Pepper Hamilton
shall be entitled to rely. Tigris, Merger Sub, Merger LLC and Potomac shall,
as of the date for filing the Form S-4 Registration Statement, execute and
deliver to Pepper Hamilton and Latham Tax Representation Letters, dated and
executed as of the filing date, on which such Tax Representation Letters
Latham and Pepper Hamilton shall be entitled to rely, including in rendering
their respective opinions to be filed (if required) in connection with the
Form S-4 Registration Statement.

Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection

Shareholders when due, and the Shareholders will, at their own expense, file
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law, Tigris will, and will
cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation. The Shareholders shall provide Tigris with (A) evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Tigris that such Transfer Taxes have been paid by
the Shareholders and (B) a clearance certificate or similar documents which
may be required by any Tax authority to relieve Tigris of any obligation to
withhold any portion of the payments to the Shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement.

5.12 Legends. Tigris shall be entitled to place appropriate legends on the
certificates evidencing any shares of Tigris Common Stock to be received in
the Merger by equityholders of Potomac who may be considered "affiliates" of
Tigris for purposes of Rules 144 and 145 under the Securities Act reflecting
the restrictions set forth in Rules 144 and 145 and to issue appropriate stop
transfer instructions to the transfer agent for Tigris Common Stock.

5.13 Interpretation of Certain Agreements. Each of the Parties agrees that the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions shall constitute a "change in
control" for purposes of each plan, agreement, contract or arrangement
identified on Part 5.13 of the Tigris Disclosure Schedule and Tigris shall
construe, interpret and administer each such plan, agreement, contract or
arrangement in a manner consistent with such interpretation. The failure to
identify a plan, agreement, contract or arrangement on Part 5.13 of the Tigris
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to reflect a determination that the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions is not a "change in control" for
purposes of such plan, agreement, contract or arrangement.

5.14 Cooperation. Each Party shall cooperate reasonably with the other Party
and shall provide the other Party with such assistance as may be reasonably
requested for the purpose of facilitating the performance by each Party of
their obligations under this Agreement and to enable the combined entity to
continue to meet its obligations following the Closing.

 5.15 Potomac Stockholder Approval. Potomac shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Required Potomac Stockholder Vote and have

been declared effective under the Securities Act.

5.16 Pre-Closing Dividend. Promptly following the final determination of Net
Cash as of the Determination Date pursuant to Section 1.6, and in any event,
prior to the Closing, Tigris shall take all actions reasonably necessary to
dividend (the "Pre-Closing Dividend") to its stockholders (a) the excess, if
any, of such Net Cash amount over $14,491,250 (the "Minimum Cash Amount") and
(b) those assets and rights described on Schedule C hereto (the amounts and
rights set forth in clauses (a) and (b), the "Pre-Closing Dividend Assets").
Prior to the Closing, Tigris shall also take all other actions described on
Schedule C hereto.

5.17 Directors and Officers. Tigris and Potomac shall obtain and deliver to
the other Party at or prior to the Effective Time the resignation of each
officer and director of Tigris or Potomac who is not continuing as an officer
or director of Tigris, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company, as
applicable, following the Effective Time. All of the directors of Tigris,
other than the Remaining Tigris Directors (as defined below), shall resign at
or prior to the Effective Time. Two designees selected by Tigris shall be
elected to or remain on, as applicable, the Board of Directors of Tigris at
the Effective Time, which two directors shall be reasonably acceptable to
Potomac (the "Remaining Tigris Directors"). The Remaining Tigris Directors
shall elect, to be effective as of the Effective Time, five designees selected
by Potomac (the "Additional Directors"), each to serve as members of the Board
of Directors of Tigris in staggered classes to be agreed upon by the Parties
prior to the Closing Date (provided, that, one Remaining Tigris Director shall
be appointed to the class whose term expires in 2015 and one Remaining Tigris
Director shall be appointed to the class whose term expires in 2016). The
Board of Directors of Tigris shall appoint each of the individuals set forth
on Part 5.17(a) of the Tigris Disclosure Schedule as officers of Tigris,
effective as of the Effective Time. The Board of Directors of Tigris shall
appoint each of the directors set forth on Part 5.17(b) of the Tigris
Disclosure Schedule to the committees of the Board of Directors set forth
opposite his or her name, effective as of the Effective Time.

commercially reasonable efforts to terminate at or prior to the Effective
Time, those agreements set forth on Schedule F (collectively, the "Investor
Agreements").

5.19 Disclosure of Liabilities. For purposes of the computation of Net Cash
pursuant to Section 1.6, on or prior to the Determination Date, Tigris shall
provide Potomac with a list of all Liabilities of Tigris or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Determination Date which are individually in excess of
$25,000 or in excess of $100,000 in the aggregate, that had not previously
been disclosed to Potomac in the Tigris Disclosure Schedules.

 5.20 Tigris Options.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Tigris Board of Directors shall have adopted
appropriate resolutions and taken all other actions necessary and appropriate
to provide that each unexpired and unexercised Tigris Option, whether vested
or unvested, shall be cancelled and retired and cease to exist effective as of
the Effective Time, and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any
Tigris Option having an exercise price per share less than the Tigris Closing
Price shall be entitled to receive in consideration of the cancellation of
such former holder's Tigris Option and in settlement therefor, a number of
shares of Tigris Common Stock calculated by dividing (i) the product of (A)
the total number of shares of Tigris Common Stock previously subject to such
Company Option, and (B) the excess of the Tigris Closing Price over the
exercise price per share of Tigris Common Stock previously subject to such
Tigris Option by (ii) the Tigris Closing Price. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the tax withholding obligations for each holder
receiving shares of Tigris Common Stock in accordance with the preceding
sentence shall be satisfied by Tigris withholding from issuance that number of
shares of Tigris Common Stock calculated by multiplying the minimum statutory
withholding rate for such holder in connection with such issuance times the
number of shares of Tigris Common Stock to be issued in accordance with the
preceding sentence, and rounding up to the nearest whole share.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Tigris Board of Directors shall have
adopted appropriate resolutions and taken all other actions necessary and
appropriate (under the Tigris Stock Plans and otherwise) to cause the issuance
to each individual set forth on Schedule G of that number of shares of Tigris
Common Stock calculated by dividing the amount set forth opposite such
individual's name on Schedule G by the Tigris Closing Price, with such
issuance to occur as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the tax withholding obligations for each individual receiving
shares of Tigris Common Stock in accordance with the preceding sentence shall
be satisfied by Tigris withholding from issuance that number of shares of
Tigris Common Stock calculated by multiplying the minimum statutory
withholding rate for such individual in connection with such issuance times
the number of shares of Tigris Common Stock to be issued in accordance with
the preceding sentence, and rounding up to the nearest whole share.

cured prior to such termination becoming effective);

(i) by Tigris, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Potomac set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of Potomac shall have become inaccurate, in either
case such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 would
not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become inaccurate, provided that if such
inaccuracy in Potomac's representations and warranties or breach by Potomac is
curable by Potomac then this Agreement shall not terminate pursuant to this

payable by Tigris to Potomac pursuant to this Section 9.3 shall be reduced and
offset by any amounts owed by Potomac to Tigris pursuant to the Tigris Notes.

Section 10. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

10.1 Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and

remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy.

(b) No Party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this

behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any
effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

and thereof; provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not
be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which

to trial by jury.

or delegated by such Party without the prior written consent of the other
Party, and any attempted assignment or delegation of this Agreement or any of
such rights or obligations by such Party without the other Party's prior
written consent shall be void and of no effect. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other
than: (a) the parties hereto; (b) the DandO Indemnified Parties to the extent of
their respective rights pursuant to Section 5.7; and (c) the rights of the
applicable stockholders of Tigris to receive the Pre-Closing Dividend Assets
and enforce their rights under Schedule C) any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

and instruments and to take such other actions as may be reasonably requested
by the other Party to evidence or reflect the Contemplated Transactions and to

10.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or

Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination shall

 have the power to limit such term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases or to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
valid and enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not
exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the Parties hereto
agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid
and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision.

10.11 Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, and each of the Parties hereto waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other Party with respect thereto.

10.12 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the provisions set forth in
Section 5.7(f) of this Agreement, this Agreement is not intended to and shall
not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder.
