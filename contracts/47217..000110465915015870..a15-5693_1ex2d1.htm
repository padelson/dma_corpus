in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent.

 



 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time, on the second Business Day following

The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is
duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such other time as
Parent and the Company shall agree in writing and shall specify in the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 



 

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the relevant provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of

debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall be amended so that it reads in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit
A-1_ hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its
terms and as provided by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended so that
they read in their entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A-2_ hereto, and, as so
amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with their terms, the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation and as provided by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 1.6 _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take, and cause to be taken,
all actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors

respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

 



 

Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II 
EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE 
CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company
(such shares, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Shares resulting from
the settlement of Company RSUs which become vested as a result of the
consummation of the Merger, but excluding (i) any Excluded Shares and (ii) any
Dissenting Shares) shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive $24.67 in cash, without interest,
and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
if any, to be paid in accordance with Section 2.3, without interest.

 



 

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 



 

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock
distribution with a record date during such period, merger or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted so as to
provide Parent and the holder of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , that nothing
in this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.2 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_

 



 

(a) _Unvested Options_. At the Effective Time, each option (each, a " _Company
Stock Option_ ") to purchase Shares granted under any employee or director
stock option, stock purchase or equity compensation plan, arrangement or
agreement of the Company, including, without limitation, under the Companys
2002 Stock Plan, the Companys 2007 Equity Incentive Plan and the AirWave
Wireless, Inc. 2000 Stock Plan, (the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), that is
unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held
by a person providing services to the Company or its Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become an option with
respect to Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each unvested Company
Stock Option, in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plans and/or
stock option agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after
the Effective Time, (i) Parent and its compensation committee (the " _Parent
Compensation Committee_ ") shall be substituted for the Company and the
compensation committee of the Company Board administering such Company Stock
Plans, (ii) each unvested Company Stock Option assumed by Parent may be
exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock (or cash, if so provided
under the terms of such unvested Company Stock Option or required under
applicable Law), (iii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
such unvested Company Stock Options shall be equal to the number of Shares
subject to such unvested Company Stock Options immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole share, and (iv) the per share exercise price under each such unvested
Company Stock Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise
price under each such unvested Company Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio and
rounding up to the nearest cent; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to
Company Stock Options that are unvested, unexercised and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and which have an exercise price
greater than the Merger Consideration, such unvested Company Stock Options
shall not be assumed by Parent and shall automatically terminate as of the
Effective Time if not exercised prior to or as of the Effective Time. In
addition, each unvested Company Stock Option that is an "incentive stock
option" or a nonqualified stock option held by a US taxpayer shall be adjusted
as required by Section 424 of the Code and Section 409A of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification,
extension or renewal of the option, within the meaning of Section 424(h) of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations under Section 409A of the Code, or
otherwise result in negative tax treatment or penalties under Section 424 of
the Code or Section 409A of the Code, and clauses (iii) and (iv) of the first
sentence of this Section 2.2(a) shall be modified to the extent necessary to
ensure such compliance. " _Exchange Ratio_ " means the fraction having a
numerator equal to the Merger Consideration and having a denominator equal to
the average closing price of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding (but not
including) the Closing Date (the " _Parent Closing Price_ ").

 



 

(b) _Vested Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option to
purchase Shares granted under any Company Stock Plan that is vested and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former holder
of any such cancelled

 



      
 

 



 

vested Company Stock Option as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any
required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i) the excess of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such vested Company
Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such vested Company
Stock Option; _provided_ , that if the exercise price per Share of any such
vested Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such vested Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without any
cash payment being made in respect thereof.

 



 

(c) _Restricted Stock Units_. Each award of restricted stock units (" _Company
RSUs_ ") representing the right to receive one Share for each Company RSU
granted under any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Company RSU
that becomes vested as a result of the consummation of the Merger and is
settled in Shares that, in turn, converts into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a)) and is held by a person providing
services to the Company or its Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become rights with respect to Parent Common
Stock, and Parent shall assume the Company RSUs, in accordance with the terms
of the Company Stock Plans and/or restricted stock unit agreement by which
each Company RSU is evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time,
(i) Parent and the Parent Compensation Committee shall be substituted for
Company and the compensation committee of the Company Board administering such
Company Stock Plans, (ii) the Company RSUs assumed by Parent shall represent
the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (or cash, if so provided
under the terms of such Company RSU or required under applicable Law) upon
settlement of such Company RSU promptly after vesting (except to the extent
the terms of the applicable restricted stock unit agreement provide for
deferred settlement, in which case settlement shall be in accordance with the
specified terms) and (iii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to each award of Company RSUs shall be equal to the number of Shares subject
to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, and in any event
Parent shall convert any remaining fractional share into the right to receive
cash based on the Parent Closing Price (except that in no event shall any
vesting restrictions applicable to a Company RSU be accelerated unless so
provided under the terms of such Company RSU or other Company Plan). For
avoidance of doubt, any market stock units granted by the Company will be
included in the definition of "Company RSUs".

 



 

(d) _Notices_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver all
required notices (which notices shall have been approved by Parent, in its
reasonable discretion) to each holder of Company Stock Options and Company
RSUs setting forth each holders rights pursuant to the respective Company
Stock Plan, stating that such Company Stock Options and/or Company RSUs shall
be treated in the manner set forth in this Section 2.2.

 



 

(e) _Company ESPP_. The Company shall take all actions necessary such that any
current offering period as of the date of this Agreement shall be the final
offering period under the Companys 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_Company ESPP_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

In addition, effective as of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
have taken all actions necessary such that (x) no new participant shall be
permitted to join any current offering period in progress under the Company
ESPP and (y) no participant in the Company ESPP with respect to any current
offering period shall be permitted to increase his or her contributions or the
amount of withholding elections with respect to any current offering period.
Unless it has earlier terminated, the Company shall take all actions necessary
so that the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall shorten the duration of
any then current offering period under the Company ESPP and purchase Shares
with all amounts withheld by the Company on behalf of the participants in the
Company ESPP as of such date. Any Shares so purchased shall be treated in
accordance with Section 2.1 above. All amounts withheld by the Company on
behalf of the participants in the Company ESPP that have not been used to
purchase Shares at or prior to the Effective Time will be returned to the
participants without interest pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP upon
the termination of the Company ESPP.

 



 

(f) _Reservation of Shares; Registration Statement_. Parent will (i) reserve
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will become subject to the
assumed Company Stock Options pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or assumed Company
RSUs pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and (ii) issue or cause to be issued the
appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock upon the exercise of the
assumed Company Stock Options or settlement of assumed Company RSUs. No later
than the later to occur of (x) twenty Business Days after the Effective Time
and (y) three Business Days after Parents first filing after the Effective
Time of a periodic report under the Exchange Act with the SEC that requires
the inclusion of a consent from Parents independent public auditors, Parent
will prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) registering a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to fulfill Parents
obligations under this Agreement. Parent will use the same level of efforts
Parent uses to maintain the effectiveness of its other registration statements
on Form S-8 to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for
so long as any assumed Company Stock Options or assumed Company RSUs remain
outstanding.

 



 

(g) The Company agrees to take any and all actions necessary to approve and
effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2, including making any
determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Exchange and Payment_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit
of holders of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
holders to the extent they hold Dissenting Shares or Excluded Shares), cash in
an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.1(a) (such cash, the " _Payment Fund_ "). From time to time
following the Effective Time as required, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Paying Agent additional cash in any amount necessary to
enable

 



      
 

 



 

the Paying Agent to pay any and all Merger Consideration payable hereunder, to
the extent the Payment Fund shall become insufficient to make such payments.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Payment Fund shall not be
used for any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to this Article
II.

 



 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate (" _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares that were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form
and contain such other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange for
the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate (other than Dissenting
Shares and Excluded Shares) the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificate (subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than
the third Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to issue and send to each holder of uncertificated Shares
represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), other than with respect
to Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares, a check or wire transfer for the
amount of cash that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(a) in respect of such Book-Entry Shares, without such holder being
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax is
not applicable.

 



 

(d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Article II, without any interest thereon.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting
Shares.

 



 

(f) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available). Any interest or other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent, upon demand.

 



 

(g) Any portion of the Payment Fund (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any remaining holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares (except to the extent representing Dissenting Shares or
Excluded Shares) shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as
general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws), without interest.

 



 

(h) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment
Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall not have been exchanged prior to the date on which the related
Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent,
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate,

 



      
 

 



 

the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



 

(j) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have
been perfected as described in Section 2.5 shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand; _provided_ , that the parties acknowledge that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required under
this Section 2.3 or otherwise to deposit with the Paying Agent any cash to pay
Merger Consideration with respect to Shares as to which its holder has
purported to deliver a notice or demand of appraisal that has not been
withdrawn prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that this
Section 2.3(j) shall not relieve Parent of any obligation to pay the Merger
Consideration for any Shares whose holder has failed to perfect or withdraws
or loses such right to appraisal, or to pay for the appraised value for any
Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall each be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, Company Stock Options, Company
RSUs, or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent determines it is required
to deduct and withhold under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until
such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost, such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares
shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal,
each such Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into and become
exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective
Time and the time that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably lost,
withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
2.1(a). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for
appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands and
any other instruments received by the Company relating to rights to appraisal,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle
or offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

Section 3.22, Section 3.27 and Section 3.28), the Company represents and

Section 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, (ii) has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions
that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except in the case of clause (iii),
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means any
event, change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or state of facts (any such
item, an " _Effect_ ") that (A) is or would reasonably be expected to be
materially adverse to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or
(B) materially impairs the ability of the Company to consummate, or prevents
or materially delays, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to do so; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of clause (A) only, Material Adverse Effect shall
not include any Effect to the extent resulting from (1) changes or conditions
generally affecting the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate, or the economy or the financial or securities markets in the United
States or any other region in the world, or regulatory and political
conditions in the United States or any other region in the world, (2)

 



       
 

 



 

the outbreak or escalation of war (whether or not declared) or acts of
terrorism, or the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters, (3) changes or
prospective changes in Law, GAAP or accounting standards, or any changes or
prospective changes in the interpretation or enforcement of any of the
foregoing, in each case after the date hereof, (4) the announcement or
pendency of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the impact thereof on relationships, contractual or
otherwise, with customers, suppliers, distributors, partners, employees, or

apply to any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company
herein that is expressly intended to address the consequences of the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby), (5) any failure, in and of itself, by
the Company and its Subsidiaries to meet any internal or published budgets,
projections, forecasts or predictions of financial performance for any period,
or any changes in the price or trading volume of the Shares (it being
understood that this clause (5) shall not prevent a party from asserting that
any underlying Effect that may have contributed to such failure independently
constitutes or contributes to a Material Adverse Effect), or (6) any matters
expressly set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , that, with
respect to clauses (1), (2) and (3), the impact of such Effect shall not be
disregarded to the extent that such impact disproportionately adversely
impacts the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to
other participants in the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate.

 



 

(c) The Company has previously delivered or made available to Parent true and
complete copies of the Companys certificate of incorporation (the " _Company
Charter_ ") and bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), in each case as amended to

and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "

duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject
to any preemptive rights. No shares of capital stock of the Company are owned
by any Subsidiary of the Company.

 



 

(b) The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable or exercisable for, securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of the Company on any matter. Except as set forth above in the
second sentence of Section 3.2(a) and except for changes since the close of
business on the Measurement Date resulting from the exercise of Company Stock
Options and settlement of Company RSUs described in Section 3.2(c) or purchase
rights under the Company ESPP, there are no outstanding (A) shares of capital
stock or other voting securities or equity interests of the Company, (B)
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital stock of the Company or
other voting securities or equity interests of the Company, (C) stock
appreciation rights, "phantom" stock rights, performance units, interests in
or rights to the ownership or earnings of the Company or other equity
equivalent or equity-based awards or rights, (D) subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments, Contracts or other rights to acquire from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or obligations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue, any shares of capital stock of the Company, voting

exercisable for capital stock or other voting securities or equity interests
of the Company or rights or interests described in the preceding clause (C) or
(E) obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities or to issue, grant, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, granted, delivered or sold, any such securities.
There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with
respect to the holding, voting, registration, redemption, repurchase or
disposition of, or that restricts the transfer of, any capital stock or other
voting securities or equity interests of the Company.

 



 

(c) Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all holders, as of the close of business on the Measurement
Date, of outstanding Company Stock Options, outstanding Company RSUs and other
similar rights to purchase or receive Shares or similar rights granted under
the Company Stock Plans or otherwise (collectively, " _Company Stock Awards_
"), indicating as applicable, with respect to each Company Stock Award then
outstanding, the type of award granted, the number of Shares subject to such
Company Stock Award, the name of the plan under which such Company Stock Award
was granted, the date of grant, exercise or purchase price, vesting schedule,
payment schedule (if different from the vesting schedule) and expiration
thereof,

 



      
 

 



 

and whether (and to what extent) the vesting of such Company Stock Award will
be accelerated or otherwise adjusted in any way or any other terms will be
triggered or otherwise adjusted in any way by the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the
termination of employment or engagement or change in position of any holder
thereof following or in connection with the Merger. Each Company Stock Option
intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the
Code so qualifies and the exercise price of each other Company Stock Option is
no less than the fair market value of a Share as determined on the date of
grant of such Company Stock Option. The Company has delivered or made
available to Parent true and complete copies of all Company Stock Plans and
the forms of all stock option agreements evidencing outstanding Company Stock
Options and the forms of all restricted stock unit agreements evidencing
outstanding Company RSUs. The treatment of Company Stock Options and Company
RSUs under Section 2.2 does not violate the terms of the plans or the award
agreements under which such Company Stock Awards were granted.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Subsidiaries and Affiliates_.

 



 

(a) Section 3.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and

officers and directors. Except for the capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any equity, membership interest, partnership interest, joint
venture interest, or other equity or voting interest in, or any interest
convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for any of the foregoing, nor is
it under any current or prospective obligation to form or participate in,
provide funds to, make any loan, capital contribution, guarantee, credit
enhancement or other investment in, or assume any liability or obligation of,
any Person.

validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that

organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is
in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept)
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except in the case of clause (iii), where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

equity interests of each of the Companys Subsidiaries are owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of all Liens. All outstanding
shares of capital stock and other voting securities or equity interests of
each Subsidiary of the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued,
are fully paid, nonassessable and not subject to any preemptive rights. None
of the Companys Subsidiaries has outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable or exercisable for, securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of the Company or such Subsidiary on any matter.

 



 

(e) There are no outstanding (A) securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for voting
securities or equity interests of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, (B) stock
appreciation rights, "phantom" stock rights, performance units, interests in
or rights to the ownership or earnings of any of the Companys Subsidiaries or
other equity equivalent or equity-based awards or rights, (C) subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, commitments, Contracts or other rights to acquire
from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or obligations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any shares of capital stock of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries, voting securities, equity interests or securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or other
voting securities or equity interests of any of the Companys Subsidiaries or
rights or interests described in the preceding clause (B), or (D) obligations
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any such securities or to issue, grant, deliver or sell, or cause to
be issued, granted, delivered or sold, any such securities. There are no
stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or of which the
Company has Knowledge with respect to the holding, voting, registration,
redemption, repurchase or disposition of, or that restricts the transfer of,
any capital stock or other voting securities or equity interests of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries.

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company

to the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding Shares (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due

hereby to be consummated by the Company other than the Merger.

 



 

Section 3.5 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

 



 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and compliance by the Company with the provisions hereof
will not, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of, or result in, termination, cancellation, modification or
acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, or result in
the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties, assets or rights of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, or give rise to any increased,
additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements under, or require

declaration, filing with or notice to, any federal, state, local or foreign

the Company or the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or compliance with the provisions hereof,

Section 3.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company has filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") on a timely basis, true and complete copies of all
forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be filed

Documents_ "). As of their respective filing dates (or, if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date
of such filing), the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may
be, including, in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
and none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) The financial statements (including the related notes and schedules

or are not expected to be, material in amount), all in accordance with GAAP
and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. The financial
and accounting books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have
been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with

(c) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed in the Companys periodic and current reports under
the Exchange Act, is made known to the Companys chief executive officer and
its chief financial officer by others within those entities to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures as required under the Exchange Act.
The chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company have
evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any

internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and

assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and
the preparation of the Companys financial statements for external purposes in

evaluation of the Companys internal control over financial reporting prior to

significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a role in the Companys

Code has been operated and maintained in compliance with Section 409A of the

Company or any Subsidiary affecting any site of employment or one or more
facilities or operating units within any site of employment or facility and

independent contractor or consultant by the Company or any Subsidiary should
have been properly classified as an employee under applicable law.

any of its Subsidiaries pending, or to the Companys Knowledge, threatened to

current or former employee, officer, consultant, or service provider of the
Company, including, without limitation, any claim relating to employment
discrimination, harassment, retaliation, equal pay, employment classification

reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

disclosure to employees or individual independent contractors of the Company
or such Subsidiaries who are bound by non-disclosure agreements or (ii) to
escrow agents under source code escrow agreements with such escrow agents that
include appropriate non-disclosure provisions. No condition has occurred that
would be sufficient to entitle the beneficiary under any source code escrow
arrangement under which the Company or any Subsidiary has deposited any such
source code for Company Products to require release of such source code from
escrow. The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger) will not constitute a source code escrow release condition to
require release of such source code for Company Products from escrow.

institution has ownership rights or ownership interest in or to any Company
Intellectual Property Rights.

(a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit or authorize any of its
Subsidiaries or any director, officer, employee, investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, endorse,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer
with respect to, or the making or completion of, any Acquisition Proposal, or
any inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information or data with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) resolve,
agree or propose to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and the Representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, other than with respect to Parent, and the respective
Representatives of Parent, (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously
granted to any such Person, (B) exercise Contractual rights, if any, to
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential

confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or

following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, (1) the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal
that the Company Board believes in good faith to be bona fide, (2) such
Acquisition Proposal was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 5.2(a), (3) the Company Board

 



      
 

 



 

determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (4) the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to take
the actions referred to in clause (x) or (y) below would result in a breach of
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law,
then the Company may (x) furnish information (including non-public
information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement containing terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to
the Company than, those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement (including
the "standstill" provisions contained therein) (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement"_ ); _provided_ , that (I) the Company shall provide
Parent a non-redacted copy of each confidentiality agreement the Company has
executed in accordance with this Section 5.2 and (II) that any non-public
information provided to any such Person shall have been previously provided to
Parent or shall be provided to Parent prior to or concurrently with the time
it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate in discussions and
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not provide (and shall not permit any
of its Representatives to provide) any commercially or competitively sensitive
non-public information in connection with the actions permitted by this
Section 5.2(a), except in accordance with "clean room" or other similar
procedures that are consistent in all material respects (including with
respect to the scope of information restricted thereby) with the Companys
practices in dealing with the disclosures of such information to Parent and
its Representatives in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby.

 



 

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

 



 

(i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub) the recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company
Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (B) recommend or otherwise declare advisable
the approval by the Company stockholders of any Acquisition Proposal, or (C)
resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions (each such action set forth
in this Section 5.2(b)(i) being referred to herein as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); or

 



 

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract, in each case constituting
or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "),
except for an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, or resolve, agree or
propose to take any such actions.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, if the Company Board determines
in

 



      
 

 



 

good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so
would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law, taking into account all adjustments to the terms
of this Agreement that may be offered by Parent pursuant to this Section
5.2(b), (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to either (I) a
Superior Proposal or (II) an Intervening Event, or (y) solely in response to a
Superior Proposal received after the date hereof that was unsolicited and did
not otherwise result from a breach of Section 5.2(a), cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(d)(ii) and
concurrently enter into a binding Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior
Proposal or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) unless:

 



 

(A) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least five Business Days before
taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifies the reasons
therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
Person making, such Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishes a copy
(if any) of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other
relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice by the Company and a new two
calendar day period); and

 



 

(B) if Parent makes an offer or proposal capable of being accepted by the
Company as a binding agreement during such five Business Day (or two calendar
day, as applicable) period to adjust the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Company Board, after taking into consideration the adjusted
terms and conditions of this Agreement as offered or proposed by Parent,
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor) that such Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement, as applicable, would result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

 



 

 _provided,_ _further_ , that the Company Board may not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event unless:

 



 

(1) the Company provides Parent with written information describing such
Intervening Event in reasonable detail;

 



 

(2) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least five Business Days before
making an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Intervening Event
of its intention to do so and specifies the reasons therefor; and

 



 

(3) if Parent makes an offer or proposal capable of being accepted by the
Company as a binding agreement during such five Business Day period to adjust
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board, after taking
into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as
offered or proposed

 



      
 

 



 

by Parent, determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel)
that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would result in a
breach of its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law.

 



 

During the five Business Day period (or two calendar day period, as
applicable) prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminating this Agreement as referred to above, the Company shall, and shall
cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent in good faith
(to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement offered or proposed by
Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall enter into any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement (except an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms (including the
payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(b), if applicable).

 



 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5.2(a)
and Section 5.2(b), the Company promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
hours of receipt) shall advise Parent in writing (including, for this purpose,
via electronic mail) in the event the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives receives (i) any indication by any Person that it is
considering making an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any inquiry or request for
information, discussion or negotiation that is reasonably likely to lead to or
that contemplates an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any proposal or offer that
is or is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case
together with a description of the material terms and conditions of and facts
surrounding any such indication, inquiry, request, proposal or offer, the
identity of the Person making any such indication, inquiry, request, proposal
or offer, and a copy of any written proposal, offer or draft agreement
provided by such Person. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed in
writing (including, for this purpose, via electronic mail) in all material
respects on a timely basis of the status and details (including, within
twenty-four hours after the occurrence of any amendment or modification to any
Acquisition Proposal) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry,
proposal or offer, including furnishing copies of any written inquiries,
correspondence and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material
oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting any of the foregoing, the
Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four hours) notify
Parent in writing (including, for this purpose, via electronic mail) if it
determines to begin providing information or to begin engaging in discussions
or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 5.2(a)
or Section 5.2(b) and shall in no event begin providing such information or
begin engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such
notice. The Company shall provide Parent with at least twenty-four hours prior
notice (or such shorter notice as may be provided to the Company Board) of a
meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected
to consider an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(d) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.2 by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that would restrict the Companys ability to comply with any of the
terms of this Section 5.2.

 



 

(f) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from the restrictions on
"business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar
provision of any other Takeover Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not
to apply, or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case unless such
actions are taken substantially concurrently with a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii).

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in Section 5.2(a) shall prohibit the Company from taking
and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14e2(a), Rule 14d9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation MA promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section
14d9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change (including for purposes of Section 7.1(c)(ii)) unless
the Company Board expressly reaffirms its recommendation to the Companys
stockholders in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger in such
disclosure and expressly rejects any applicable Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer with respect to any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase or license, in one transaction or a
series of transactions, and whether through any merger, reorganization,

shall (i) prepare and file a Proxy Statement with the SEC in preliminary form
as required by the Exchange Act (in any event no later than fifteen calendar
days after the date hereof) and (ii) set a preliminary record date for the

Merger, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers should be discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that such document would not contain any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and the Company shall promptly file with the SEC an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the
stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or

_Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") solely for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval and, if applicable, the advisory vote required by
Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection therewith (and such
Company Stockholders Meeting shall in any event be no later than forty-five
calendar days after (i) the tenth calendar day after the preliminary Proxy
Statement therefor has been filed with the SEC if by such date the SEC has not
informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement or (ii) if
the SEC has, by the tenth calendar day after the preliminary Proxy Statement
therefor has been filed with the SEC, informed the Company that it intends to
review the Proxy Statement, the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no
further comments on the Proxy Statement). The Company may postpone or adjourn
the Company Stockholders Meeting solely (i) with the consent of Parent;
(ii)(A) due to the absence of a quorum or (B) if the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares for the Company Stockholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, to solicit additional proxies;
_provided_ , that the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting more than a total of two times pursuant to the preceding
clause (ii)(A) and/or clause (ii)(B); or (iii) to allow reasonable additional
time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure
which the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Companys stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall, at the request of Parent, to
the extent permitted by Law, adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to a
date specified by Parent for the absence of a quorum or if the Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares for the Company
Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting more than one time pursuant to this
sentence, and no such adjournment pursuant to this sentence shall be required
to be for a period exceeding ten Business Days or for any period that would
require the Company to select a different record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting, _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall not be
entitled to exercise the foregoing right to cause the adjournment of the
Company Stockholders Meeting if the Company has previously exercised the right
to adjourn such meeting contained in clause (ii)(A) or clause (ii)(B) of the
prior sentence. Except in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change
specifically permitted by Section 5.2(b), the Company, through the Company
Board, shall (i) recommend to its stockholders that they adopt this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) include such recommendation
in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company agrees that (x) except in the event of an Adverse Recommendation
Change specifically permitted by Section 5.2(b), the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval and (y) its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3(b) shall not be
affected by the commencement, public

 



      
 

 



 

proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other
Person of any Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of any Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business

this Agreement in accordance with its terms, to all their respective
properties (subject to the Companys and its Subsidiaries reasonable security
measures but excluding the right to perform any invasive testing or sampling)
assets, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such
period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to Parent: (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and (b) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent
or Merger Sub may reasonably request (including Tax Returns filed and those in
preparation and the work papers of its auditors); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not require the Company to disclose any information
to the extent such disclosure would contravene applicable Law or would cause
the waiver of any legal privilege, _provided_ , that the parties will
cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to find a way to allow diligence of
such information in a manner that would not contravene such law or cause such
waiver of a legal privilege. All such information shall be held confidential
in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement between Parent
and the Company dated as of October 2, 2014 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
"). No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4 or information provided,
made available or delivered to Parent pursuant to this Agreement shall affect
any of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the
conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereunder.

shall commit to the payment of any fee, penalty or other consideration or make
any other concession, waiver or amendment under

 



      
 

 



 

any Contract in connection with obtaining any consent without the prior
written consent of Parent. Each of the parties hereto shall furnish to each
other party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other
party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to
applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company
shall each have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable,
each shall consult with the other in connection with, all of the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their

circumstances, shall provide the other party and its counsel with the
opportunity to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be required to (i) agree or
proffer to divest or hold separate (in a trust or otherwise), or take any
other action with respect to, any of the assets or businesses of Parent or any
of its Affiliates or, assuming the consummation of the Merger, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Affiliates, (ii) agree or proffer to limit in any
manner whatsoever or not to exercise any rights of ownership of any securities
(including the Shares) or (iii) enter into any agreement that in any way
limits the ownership or operation of any business of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

(c) The Company shall take all actions to comply with its obligations under
Section 5.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall (a) take

change, condition or event occurring after the date hereof (i) that renders or
would reasonably be expected to render any representation or warranty of such
party set forth in this Agreement (disregarding any materiality qualification
contained therein) to be untrue or inaccurate in any manner that could
reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
Section 6.3(a), as the case may be, not to be satisfied or (ii) that results
or would reasonably be expected to result in any failure of such party to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses existing in favor of the current or
former directors and officers of the Company and each Subsidiary of the
Company as provided in the Company Charter or Company Bylaws (and comparable
governing documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company that have been
delivered and made available to Parent prior to the date hereof) as in effect
on the date of this Agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time shall be assumed and performed by the Surviving Corporation and

liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy (a correct and complete
copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent) for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that Parent may
(i) substitute therefor policies of an insurance company the material terms of
which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material
respect to such directors and officers than the Companys existing policies as
of the date hereof or (ii) request that the Company obtain such extended
reporting period coverage under its existing insurance programs (to be
effective as of the Effective Time); and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no
event shall Parent or the Company be required to pay annual premiums for
insurance under this Section 5.8(b) in excess of 150% of the amount of the
annual premiums paid by the Company for fiscal year 2014 for such purpose
(which fiscal year 2014 premiums are hereby represented and warranted by the
Company to be as set forth in Section 5.8(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter), it being understood that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to
provide as much coverage as may be obtained for such 150%

set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail"
prepaid policy on the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ , that
the aggregate cost for such "tail" policy shall not exceed 250% of the amount
of the annual premiums paid by the Company for fiscal year 2014 for such
purpose. In the event that the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy
prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force
and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in
lieu of all other obligations of the Surviving Corporation (and Parent) under

shall be maintained in full force and effect (subject to the proviso in the
preceding sentence).

successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successor and assign of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this Section
5.8.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,

practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements (to the extent not previously publicly disclosed or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
shall not issue any such press release or make any public announcement prior
to such consultation and review, except (x) as may be required by applicable
Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system and
(y) in connection with any Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board shall take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of
Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such Shares) resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3

shall provide Parent evidence that the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board
or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. The form and
substance of such resolutions shall be substantially in the form contained in

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall permit all employees of
the Company or its Subsidiaries who remain employees of Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent (" _Continuing Employees_ ") to participate in the
benefit programs of Parent or the Subsidiary to the same extent as similarly
situated employees of Parent or the Subsidiary. In the U.S., such employees
who become employees of Parent shall be given credit for all service with the
Company or its U.S. Subsidiaries solely for the purposes of determining their
rate of vacation accrual under Parents standard vacation program; service
credit for all other purposes shall begin at the Effective Time. Outside the
U.S., such employees who become employees of a Subsidiary of Parent shall be
given credit for service with the Company or its Subsidiaries solely as

such Continuing Employee shall be paid by the Company in cash for any accrued
and unused vacation days that Parent determines are not administratively
practicable to carry over.

 



 

(c) Section 5.14(b) shall not operate to duplicate any benefit provided to any
employee, require Parent to continue in effect any specific Company employee
benefit plan or Parent employee benefit plan, or prohibit the termination of
any specific employee, following the Effective Time. Nothing contained herein,
express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (ii) shall alter or limit
the ability of Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

 



 

(d) For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor
in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, all existing employment, change of control, severance and retention
arrangements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and any current or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand (including, for avoidance of doubt,
any non-Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated prior to the
Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit Parent or its Subsidiaries from terminating the employment of any
Continuing Employee or amending or terminating any such plans or agreements,
so long as such amendment or termination complies with the terms of any such
plans or agreements, including specifically obtaining any necessary or
required consents.

 



 

(e) The Company shall terminate any and all group severance, separation,
deferred compensation or salary continuation plans, programs, policies or
arrangements (other than as described or disclosed in Section 5.14(d) above)
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, effective in each case
no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law. The Company shall provide Parent evidence that such plans have
been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or the board of
directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable (the form and substance of which
resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent).

 



 

(f) This Section 5.14 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.14,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.14.

to deliver to Parent at the Closing Date a properly executed Foreign
Investment and Real Property Tax Act of 1980 notification letter which states

Company be required to pay the Termination Fee to Parent on more than one

signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the time of the

the other parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered

, _however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained,
no waiver may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further
approval or adoption by the stockholders of the Company without such further
approval or adoption. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a

 



      
 

 



 

written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on
behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right
or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of
conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any

rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement (a) to Parent or any of its Affiliates at any time, in which case
all references herein to Parent or Merger Sub shall be deemed references to

shall be deemed to be representations and warranties made with respect to such
other Affiliate as of the date of such assignment or (b) after the Effective

shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the

prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect

illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been
contained herein.
