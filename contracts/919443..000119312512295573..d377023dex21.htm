This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (" _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into
as of July 5, 2012 (the " _Agreement Date_ "), by and among ABC-MART, INC.,
a corporation formed under the laws of Japan (" _Parent_ "), XYZ Merger Sub,
Inc., a Wisconsin corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Purchaser_ "), and LaCrosse Footwear, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the "
_Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in
Exhibit A.

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company have approved this Agreement and the acquisition of the Company by
Purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Purchaser has agreed to commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ")
to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (such shares of outstanding Company Common Stock being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Shares_ "), at a price per Share of $20.00
(such amount or any greater amount per Share that may be paid pursuant to the
Offer, the " _Offer Price_ ");

 

WHEREAS, following the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
in accordance with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the " _WBCL_ "),
Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company
continuing as the Surviving Corporation (the " _Merger_ "), whereby each
issued and outstanding Share that is not tendered and accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer (other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with
Sections 2.5(a)(i) and 2.5(a)(ii) and other than Dissenting Shares) will be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders; (ii) adopted, approved and
declared advisable this Agreement, the Tender Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Offer and the Merger; and (iii)
recommended that the Companys shareholders accept the Offer, tender their
Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer and, to the extent applicable,
adopt and approve this Agreement (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "); and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Purchaser to enter
into this Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company are executing Tender
and Voting Agreements in favor of Parent, substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B (each, a " _Tender Agreement_ " and collectively, the "
_Tender Agreements_ ").

 



1 AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

 

1.1 The Offer.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 7.1 hereof and provided that none of the events in clauses (a)
through (g) of paragraph 2 of  _Annex A_ shall have occurred and shall not
have been waived by Purchaser, as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days), Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all Shares at a price per share
equal to the Offer Price (as such Offer Price may be adjusted pursuant to
Section 1.1(h)).

 

(b) The obligation of Purchaser upon expiration of the Offer to accept for
payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by
Parent or Purchaser, of the conditions set forth in Annex A (the " _Offer
Conditions_ "). Subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or
Purchaser, of the Offer Conditions (including the satisfaction of the Minimum
Condition), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) consummate
the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment and pay for all
Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as
promptly as practicable after the Expiration Date (the time of such acceptance
for payment, and the payment for such Shares, the " _Acceptance Time_ ").
The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller in
cash, without interest, subject to the withholding of any Taxes required by
applicable Law, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase that describes
the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth in this Agreement. Parent
and Purchaser expressly reserve the right (but shall not be obligated), at any
time and from time to time in their sole discretion, to waive any Offer
Condition, to increase the Offer Price or to modify or amend any other terms
and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the written
consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii)
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the
number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or modify any of the
Offer Conditions in a manner that is adverse in any material respect to the
holders of Shares or impose conditions to the Offer that are different than
or in addition to the Offer Conditions, (v) amend or waive the Minimum
Condition, or (vi) extend the Expiration Date in a manner other than pursuant
to and in accordance with this Agreement. The failure by Parent or Purchaser
at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any such right, and each right shall be deemed an ongoing right that
may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 

 



2 (d) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at
midnight (New York City time) on the date (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ")
that is twenty (20) Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) after the commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, on the Initial Expiration Date any of the Offer Conditions set
forth in paragraphs 1(a), 2(a) or 2(b) of Annex A are not satisfied or, to the
extent waivable in accordance with the terms hereof, has not been waived by
Parent or Purchaser, then Purchaser shall extend the Offer for a period of
five (5) Business Days to permit such Offer Conditions to be satisfied.
Thereafter, if so requested by the Company by written notice delivered to
Purchaser on or prior to the date the Offer is then scheduled to expire,
Purchaser shall extend the Offer for one or more periods of not more than five
(5) Business Days each, to permit the Offer Conditions set forth in
paragraphs 1(a), 2(a) or 2(b) of Annex A to be satisfied, or to the extent
waivable in accordance with the terms hereof, validly waived by Purchaser.
Purchaser may, but shall not be obligated to, extend (and re-extend)
the Offer and its expiration date (the Initial Expiration Date as it may be
extended herein is referred to as the " _Expiration Date_ ") for one or more
periods, in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each, the
length of each such period to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion
(or such longer period as the Parties hereto may agree), to permit any Offer
Conditions to be satisfied. Purchaser shall, without the consent of the
Company, extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or any rule or regulation
of Nasdaq, in each case, applicable to the Offer: _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, Purchaser shall not be
required to (i) extend the Offer (A) beyond the Outside Date or (B) at any
time that Parent or Purchaser is permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Article VII, or (ii) waive any Offer Conditions.

(e) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII.

 

(f) If the Acceptance Time occurs, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion,
commence a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under
the Exchange Act (a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") of up to twenty (20)
Business Days. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for
payment, and pay for, all Shares as promptly as practicable after any such
Shares are validly tendered during such Subsequent Offering Period. The Offer
Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered during
such Subsequent Offering Period shall be paid net to the seller in cash,
without interest, subject to the withholding of any Taxes required by
applicable Law.

(g) On or prior to the commencement date of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser
shall: (i) file or cause to be filed with the SEC, in accordance with Rule
14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") that will contain or incorporate by reference
the offer to purchase the Shares pursuant to the Offer, the form of the
related letter of transmittal, the summary advertisement and other ancillary
Offer documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
(collectively, and together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "); and (ii) cause the

 



3  Schedule TO and related Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of
Shares in accordance with applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish
to Parent and Purchaser all information concerning the Company that may be
required by applicable Law or reasonably requested in connection with any
action contemplated by this Section 1.1(g). The Company and its counsel shall
be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company
and its counsel. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to correct
promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent and
Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders
of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws. Upon receipt of any written or oral comments by Parent,
Purchaser or their counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents, Parent and Purchaser agree to: (i) promptly provide the Company and
its counsel with a copy of any such written comments (or a description of any
such oral comments); (ii) provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to comment on any proposed response thereto, and give reasonable
and good faith consideration to any such comments made by the Company and its
counsel; and (iii) promptly provide the Company with copies of any written
comments or responses submitted by Parent and Purchaser in response thereto.

 

(h) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring
or having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to Purchasers
acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Company Common Stock tendered in
the Offer, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to the holders
of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action.

(i) Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable to any holder of any Company Stock Certificate (in his or her capacity
as a holder of Company Common Stock) such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

1.2 Company Actions.

 

(a) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall
file or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender
Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to
the Offer (together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto, the
" _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that, subject to Section 5.4(e)(i), shall contain and
reflect the Company Board Recommendation. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents and to
the inclusion

 



4  of a copy of the Schedule 14D-9 with the Offer Documents mailed or furnished
to holders of Shares. The Company hereby agrees to take all steps necessary to
cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be prepared and filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Companys shareholders, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Law. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall promptly
furnish to the Company in writing all information concerning Parent and
Purchaser that may be required by applicable Law or reasonably requested in
connection with any actions contemplated by this Section 1.2(a). The Company
agrees to provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with
the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. Each of the Company,
Parent and Purchaser agrees to promptly correct any information provided by
it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. The Company
further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys
shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law.
Upon receipt of any written or oral comments received by the Company or its
counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the
Company agrees to: (i) promptly provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel
with a copy of any such written comments (or a description of any such
oral comments); (ii) provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable
opportunity to comment on any proposed response thereto, and give reasonable
and good faith consideration to any such comments made by Parent, Purchaser
and their counsel; and (iii) promptly provide Parent or Purchaser with copies
of any written comments or responses submitted by the Company in response
thereto.

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
to furnish Parent and Purchaser promptly (and in any event no later than two
(2) Business Days after the date hereof) with (i) mailing labels containing
the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares; and (ii) security
position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent
date, together with other readily available listings and computer files
containing names, addresses and security position listings of record holders
and non-objecting beneficial owners of Shares as of the most recent
practicable date. The Company shall furnish Parent and Purchaser with such
additional information, including, without limitation, updated listings and
computer files of holders of Shares, mailing labels and security position
listings, and such other assistance as Parent, Purchaser or their agents may
reasonably require in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial
holders of Shares. Subject to applicable Law, and except for such actions as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents, Parent and Purchaser shall
hold in confidence the information and documents provided to them under this
Section 1.2(b), shall use such information only in connection with the Offer
and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, as promptly
as practicable after such termination, deliver to the Company all such
information and documents (along with all copies thereof) then in their
possession or control.

1.3 Directors of the Company.

(a) Provided that the Minimum Condition is satisfied, promptly after the
Acceptance Time, Parent shall be entitled to designate up to such number of
directors (rounded up to the next whole number) on the Company Board equal to
the product of (i) the total number

 



5  of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the election of any
additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)); and (ii) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of Shares held by Parent and Purchaser
(giving effect to Shares paid for pursuant to the Offer and, if the Top-Up
Option is exercised, the number of shares of Company Common Stock purchased
upon exercise thereof), and the denominator of which is the total number of
then outstanding Shares (not determined on a Fully Diluted Basis). In
furtherance thereof, the Company and the Company Board shall, after the
purchase of and payment for Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer, upon
request of Purchaser, promptly increase the size of the Company Board or seek
and accept, or use reasonable best efforts to otherwise secure, the
resignations of such number of directors as is necessary to enable Parents
designees to be so elected to the Company Board, and shall cause Parents
designees to be so elected. In addition, subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall take all action necessary to cause the individuals so designated
by Parent to constitute substantially the same percentage (rounding up where
appropriate) of each committee of the Company Board as the percentage
represented by such individuals on the Company Board as a whole.

(b) The Company shall promptly file with the SEC and mail to the holders of
Shares the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder. Parent and Purchaser will supply the Company
with, and will be solely responsible for, any information with respect to them
and their nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by such
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.3, Parent,
Purchaser and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to cause the Company Board to include, at all times prior to the Effective
Time, at least two (2) of the members of the Company Board, selected by
members of the Company Board, who were directors of the Company immediately
prior to the Acceptance Time (the " _Continuing Directors_ "), each of whom
shall be an "independent director" as defined by Rule 4200(a)(15) of the
Nasdaq marketplace rules and eligible to serve on the Companys audit
committee under the Exchange Act and the applicable requirements of Nasdaq;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if at any time prior to the Acceptance Time
there shall be fewer than two (2) Continuing Directors on the Company Board
for any reason, the Company Board shall cause the person(s) designated by the
remaining Continuing Director(s) to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to
be a Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement, or if no
Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors of the Company then in
office shall designate two (2) persons to fill such vacancies who are not
directors, officers, employees, shareholders, designees or Affiliates of
Parent or Purchaser and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing
Directors for all purposes of this Agreement.

(d) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees to the
Company Board pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and so long as such designees
continue to constitute a majority of the directors on the Company Board, then
until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing
Directors (or the approval of the sole Continuing Director if there shall be
only one (1) Continuing Director) shall be required to authorize: (i) any
amendment or modification to, or termination of, or any agreement to amend,
modify or terminate, this Agreement by or on behalf of the Company; (ii) any
extension or waiver by the Company of the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser under this 

 



6  Agreement; (iii) any exercise or waiver of any of the Companys rights or
remedies hereunder; or (iv) any other action that could reasonably be expected
to adversely affect in any material respect the rights of the Companys
shareholders hereunder. Following the election or appointment of Parents
designees to the Company Board pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the
Effective Time, any action by the Company with respect to the enforcement of
this Agreement by the Company shall be effected only by and at the direction
of a majority of the Continuing Directors (or the action of the sole
Continuing Director if there shall be only one (1) Continuing Director then
in office), and no other action on the part of the Company, including any
action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize,
or for the Company to take, any such action. The Continuing Directors shall
have the authority to retain such counsel and other advisors at the expense of
the Company as determined by the Continuing Directors and any such expenses
shall be paid by the Company promptly upon written request by the Continuing
Directors.

1.4 Top-Up Option.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Section 1.4 and only for so long as this Agreement has not
been terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, to purchase at a price per share
equal to the Offer Price an aggregate number of newly and validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up
Option Shares_ ") up to that number of shares of Company Common Stock that,
when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and
Purchaser at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute ten
thousand (10,000) shares more than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock
then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares, and excluding from the calculation of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock Parent and Purchaser then own, but not from the calculation of
then-outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Shares tendered pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement
or satisfaction of such guarantee) (the " _Short-Form Threshold_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option may not be exercised (i) to
purchase an amount of Top-Up Option Shares in excess of the number of shares
of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued (treating shares owned by the
Company as treasury stock as unissued) and not otherwise reserved or committed
for issuance at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, (ii) if prohibited
by applicable Law, and (iii) unless the Acceptance Time shall have occurred.
Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate purchase price required to be
paid for the Top-Up Option Shares as set forth in Section 1.4(b).

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 1.4(a), in the event
Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser shall give the
Company prior written notice specifying (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent and Purchaser at the time
of such notice (giving effect to the Acceptance Time) and (ii) a place and
time for the closing of such purchase. The Company shall, within one (1)
Business Day following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to
Purchaser specifying, based on the information provided by Purchaser in its
notice, the number of Top-Up Option Shares to be purchased. At the closing of
the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "), the
purchase price owed by Purchaser to the Company to purchase the Top-Up Option
Shares shall be paid to the Company, at Purchasers option: (A) in cash, by
wire transfer

 



7  of same-day funds; or (B) by (1) paying in cash, by wire transfer of same-
day funds, an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the
Top-Up Option Shares and (2) executing and delivering to the Company a
promissory note having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase
price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash pursuant to
the preceding clause (1) (the " _Promissory Note_ "). The Promissory Note:
(x) shall be due on the first anniversary of the Top-Up Closing; (y) shall
bear simple interest of 2% per annum, payable in arrears at maturity; and (z)
may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty.
At the Top-Up Closing, the Company shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a
certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares.

 

(c) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act. The parties shall cooperate to ensure
that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with
all applicable Laws, including compliance with an applicable exemption from
registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act. Each of
Parent and Purchaser acknowledges that the Top-Up Option Shares that Purchaser
may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under
the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption
thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of Parent
and Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company that Purchaser will be
upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor," as
defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Each
of Parent and Purchaser represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-Up Option
and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option are being and will be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). Any
certificates evidencing Top-Up Option Shares shall include any legends
required by applicable securities Laws.

(d) Any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock
resulting from the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares or the Promissory Note
will not be taken into account in any determination of the fair value of any
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 180.1301 of the WBCL as contemplated by
Section 2.9 of this Agreement and none of the Parties shall take any position
to the contrary in any appraisal proceeding.

2.4 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers. At the
Effective Time:

the Company:

(i) all shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any wholly owned

prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be paid in exchange therefor;

 

(ii) all shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Purchaser or any other

of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of
shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted.

2.6 Company Equity Awards.

 

(a) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall assume any Company Options in
connection with the Offer, Merger or any other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, and in any event prior to the earlier to occur of the Effective
Time and the Initial Expiration Date (as extended pursuant to Section
1.1(d)), the Company shall obtain all necessary waivers, consents and/or
releases, if any, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
from holders of Company Options, and take such further action, without
incurring any liabilities in connection therewith, as the Company may deem to
be necessary or reasonably required to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.6. As promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board or a committee
thereof or any administrator of an Option Plan, shall adopt resolutions and/or
take such other actions as are permissible under the Option Plans and
applicable Law (including, without limitation, by amending the Option Plans)
so that (i) all outstanding Company Options shall fully vest and become
exercisable as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time and (ii) to the
extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, then immediately prior to
the Effective Time each Company Option held by an optionholder who has
consented to the treatment of the options as set forth in this Section 2.6
shall be canceled, with each former holder of any such canceled
Company Option becoming entitled to receive, at the Effective Time or as soon
as practicable thereafter, in consideration of the cancellation of such
Company Option, an amount in cash, without interest and subject to deduction
for any required withholding Tax, equal to the product of: (x) the excess, if
any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price of each such Company Option;
and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company
Option; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the exercise price per share of any
such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Offer Price, such Company
Option shall be canceled and terminated as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.

(b) Unless a later time for payment is agreed between Parent and an individual
holder of a Company Option, Parent shall pay (or cause to be paid) the
holders of Company Options the applicable cash payments (if any) described in
this Section 2.6 promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event not later
than the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Effective Time.

 



10 2.7 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a)
all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company; and (b) the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No
further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on
such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, a valid certificate previously representing any shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company
Stock Certificate_ ") is presented to the Payment Agent or to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and
shall be exchanged as provided in Section 2.8 below.

2.8 Surrender of Certificates. 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or
trust company to act as payment agent in the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_
"). Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Payment Agent cash sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration payable pursuant
to Section 2.5. The cash amount so deposited with the Payment Agent is
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_." The Payment Agent will invest the funds
included in the Payment Fund in the manner directed by Parent. Any interest or
other income resulting from the investment of such funds shall be the
property of Parent.

(b) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent will direct the Payment
Agent to mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock
Certificates immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Payment Agent for
exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other
documents as may be reasonably required by the Payment Agent or Parent: (A)
the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration; and (B) the Company Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.8(b), each Company Stock Certificate shall be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.5. If any Company
Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or the
Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate
to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Payment Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates as of the date that is one (1) year after the
Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
Company Stock Certificates who have not

 



11  theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with
this Section 2.8 shall thereafter look only to Parent, as general creditors
thereof, for satisfaction of their claims for the Merger Consideration.

(d) Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable to any holder
of any Company Stock Certificate (in his or her capacity as a holder of
Company Common Stock) such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
from such consideration under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.

(e) Neither the Payment Agent, Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of any Company Stock Certificate or to any other Person
with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property Law, escheat Law or similar
Law. 

2.9 Dissenting Shares.

(a) It is anticipated that on the record date fixed for purposes of
determining the holders of Shares entitled to receive notice of, and to vote
at, a meeting to approve this Agreement (or for purposes of determining
whether the Merger may be consummated without a shareholder vote under Section
180.1104 of the WBCL), the Shares will continue to be quoted on Nasdaq.
Accordingly, holders of Shares will not have dissenters rights under Section
180.1302 of the WBCL in connection with the Merger. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Section 2.9(b) and Section 2.9(c) below shall apply in the event
that holders of Shares do have dissenters rights, whether because the Shares
are no longer quoted on Nasdaq on such record date or otherwise.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that
are held by any record holder who has not voted to approve this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing, who is entitled to assert dissenters rights
under Section 180.1302 of the WBCL and who has asserted dissenters rights in
accordance with Section 180.1301 et seq. of the WBCL (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration but shall be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due in respect of such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to the WBCL; _provided, however,_ that any holder of
Dissenting Shares who shall have failed to perfect or shall have withdrawn or
lost such shareholders dissenters rights with respect to such Dissenting
Shares, in each case under the WBCL, shall forfeit such shareholders
dissenters rights with respect to such Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive, as
of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration without interest.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.9(b), if
the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any shareholder to be
paid the fair value of such shareholders Dissenting Shares shall cease. The
Surviving Corporation shall comply with all of its obligations under the WBCL
with respect to holders of Dissenting Shares. 

 



12 (c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of any notices of
intent to demand payment, any withdrawals of such notices received by the
Company and any other related instruments served pursuant to the WBCL and
received by the Company; and (ii) the opportunity to direct and participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for payment under
Section 180.1301 et seq. of the WBCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal or negotiate, offer to settle or settle any such demands.

2.10 Merger Without Meeting of Shareholders. Notwithstanding the terms
of Section 5.3, if after the Acceptance Time and, if applicable, the exercise
of the Top-Up Option, Parent, Purchaser and any other Subsidiary of Parent own
that number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to or in excess of the
Short-Form Threshold, the parties hereto agree to take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as promptly as
practicable without a meeting of the Company shareholders in accordance with
Section 180.1104 of the WBCL. 

2.11 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser and
the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of the
Company and otherwise) to take such action.

Section 401 of the Code is so qualified and its related trust is tax-exempt,
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred that could
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualified or tax-exempt
status and each such plan has timely been amended to comply with
all applicable Laws,.

(m) To the extent applicable, each International Employee Plan (i) has been
approved by the relevant taxation and other Governmental Body so as to
enable: (1) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the participants and
beneficiaries under the relevant International Employee Plan; and (2) in the

regulations regarding employee benefits, mandatory contributions and

 



36  retirement plans of each jurisdiction applicable to such International

been maintained in good standing with the applicable regulatory authorities.
The fair market value of the assets of each Funded International Employee
Plan, the liability of each insurer for any International Employee Plan funded
through insurance or the book reserve established for any International
Employee Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to
procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, with respect to all
current and former participants in such plan according to the actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such International Employee Plan, and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations, and any and all amounts
required to be accrued with respect to any International Employee Plan or
pursuant to any statutory requirements pertaining to employee benefits,
mandatory contributions, retirement plans or similar benefits, have
been properly and timely accrued, including accruals relating to any
severance, termination pay or profit sharing benefits.

respect to any Company Employee Plan have been timely made, accrued or
reserved for.

Subsidiaries has any plan or commitment to amend in any material respect or
establish any new Company Employee Plan or to continue or materially increase
any benefits under any Company Employee Plan.

Subsidiaries.

 



38 3.22 Insurance. Part 3.22-1 of the Disclosure Schedule lists each insurance
policy maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Agreement
Date. The Company and its Subsidiaries have all material policies of insurance
covering the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective employees,
properties or assets, including policies of life, property, title, fire,
workers compensation, products liability, directors and officers liability
and other casualty and liability insurance, that is in a form and amount that
is customarily carried by persons conducting business similar to that of the
Company and which the Company believes is adequate for the operation of its
business. All such insurance policies are in full force and effect, and there
is no existing default or event which, with or without the giving of notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, by any insured
thereunder, except for such defaults that could not be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Since December 31, 2006, the Company has not received any notice or other
communication regarding any actual or possible: (a) cancellation or
invalidation of any insurance policy; (b) refusal or denial of any material
coverage, reservation of rights or rejection of any material claim under any
insurance policy; or (c) material adjustment in the amount of the premiums
payable with respect to any insurance policy. All information provided to
insurance carriers (in applications and otherwise) on behalf of the Company
is accurate and complete to the extent that the failure of such information to
be accurate and complete would entitle the applicable insurance carrier to
cancel the insurance policy procured on the basis of or in reliance on such
information, reduce the scope of coverage under such policy, increase the
premiums payable by the Company or otherwise take any action adverse to the
Company in any material respect. The Company has provided timely written
notice to the appropriate insurance carrier(s) of each Legal Proceeding
pending or threatened in writing against the Company, and no such carrier has
issued a denial of coverage or a reservation of rights with respect to any
such Legal Proceeding, or informed the Company in writing of its intent to do
so. Except as set forth on Part 3.22-2 of the Disclosure Schedule, none of the
insurance policies will terminate or lapse (or be affected in any other
adverse manner) by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.3 Company Shareholders Meeting.

(a) If adoption of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders is required by
applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, the Company shall, as soon
as practicable after the Acceptance Time, prepare and the Company shall file
with the SEC a proxy statement (collectively, as amended or supplemented, the
" _Proxy Statement_ ") that will be provided to the Companys shareholders in
connection with solicitation of proxies for use at the meeting of the
Companys shareholders called to vote upon this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ "). The
Company shall include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board
Recommendation. Parent and Purchaser, as the case may be, shall furnish all
information concerning Parent and Purchaser (and their respective Affiliates,
if applicable) as the Company may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. Subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Companys shareholders as
promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time. Each of the Company,
Parent and Purchaser shall promptly correct any information provided by it or
any of its respective Representatives for use in the Proxy Statement if and to
the extent that such information contains any untrue statement of material
fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or to
the extent necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company shall
take all steps necessary to cause the Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys shareholders, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall
provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to the filing thereof with the SEC,
and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel (it being understood
that Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall provide any comments thereon as
soon as reasonably practicable). The Company shall provide in writing to
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel any comments or other communications,
whether written or oral, the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after such receipt,
and the Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any response to any such
comments of the SEC or its staff, and the Company shall give reasonable and
good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel (it being understood that Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall
provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable).

 



49 (b) If approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders
is required by applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, the Company,
acting through the Company Board, shall, as soon as practicable following the
Acceptance Time and in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter
Documents, promptly and duly call, establish a record date for, give notice
of, convene and hold as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof, the Company Shareholders Meeting. At the Company Shareholders Meeting,
Parent and Purchaser shall cause all Shares then owned by them and their
Subsidiaries to be voted in favor of the approval and adoption of this
Agreement.

 

5.4 No Solicitation by the Company; Other Offers.

(a) Subject to Section 5.4(b), from the Agreement Date until the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates or any of its or their respective
Representatives to, directly or indirectly through another Person, except as
otherwise provided below: (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate, induce
or take any other action which could reasonably be expected to lead to the
making, submission or announcement of, any proposal or inquiry that
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii)
other than informing Persons of the provisions contained in this Section
5.4, enter into, continue or participate in any discussions or any
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise take any action
to facilitate or induce any effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) except as required by applicable Law, furnish to
any Person (other than Parent, Purchaser or any designees of Parent or
Purchaser) any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than
Parent, Purchaser or any designees of Parent or Purchaser); (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding or other Contract contemplating an
Acquisition Proposal or requiring the Company to abandon or terminate its
obligations under this Agreement; (v) terminate, amend, modify or waive any
rights under any "standstill" or other similar agreement between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and any Person; or (vi) resolve, propose or agree
to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated all activities, discussions or negotiations
with any Person previously conducted with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) day following the
date hereof) deny access to any data room (virtual or actual) containing any
confidential information previously furnished to any Third Party relating to
the consideration of any Acquisition Proposal by any such Third Party.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.4 to the contrary, at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, in response to a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside counsel and financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal and which Acquisition Proposal did not result from or arise
in connection with a breach of this Section 5.4, the Company may, subject to
compliance with Section 5.4(c), upon a good faith determination by the
Company Board (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel) that failure
to take such action would or would be reasonably likely to be a breach of the
Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under

 



50  applicable Law: (i) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons
Representatives);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and such Person
enter into a customary confidentiality agreement (which shall permit the
Company to comply with the terms of Section 5.4(c)) containing customary
confidentiality and standstill provisions but not providing for reimbursement
by the Company of any fees, costs or expenses; and _provided further_ , that
all such information shall have been previously provided to Parent or is
provided to Parent prior to or at the same time that it is provided to such
Person; and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not take any of the actions referred
to in clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence unless the
Company shall have notified Parent in writing at least forty-eight (48) hours
prior to taking such action that it intends to take such action and the basis
therefor.

(c) In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 5.4(b), the Company
shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing, in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (including
any request for information or other inquiry in connection with or which could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal), of the Companys
receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or request for information or other
inquiry in connection with or which could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, and in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity
of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and the terms and conditions of
any proposal or offer or the nature of any inquiries or contacts, and
thereafter shall promptly keep Parent informed of all developments affecting
the status, details and terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal
and of the status of any such discussions or negotiations. In addition to the
foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent with at least thirty-six (36)
hours prior written notice of a meeting of the Company Board at which the
Company Board is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal
(including any request for information or other inquiry in connection with or
which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal) or a
Change in Company Board Recommendation.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, Purchaser and
the Company acknowledge and agree that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 5.4 by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.4 by the
Company. The Company shall not enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement as permitted
by Section 5.4(b)) contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition
Proposal unless and until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII
and the Company has paid all amounts due to Parent pursuant to Section 7.3, if
any.

 

(e) The Company Board shall not: (i) fail to make the Company Board
Recommendation to the Companys shareholders in the Schedule 14D-9 and
otherwise; (ii) withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Purchaser, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the Company
Board Recommendation; (iii) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise
declare advisable the adoption of any Acquisition Proposal or Company
Acquisition Agreement (other than those relating to the Offer, it being
understood that, with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer, taking a
neutral position or no position with respect to any Acquisition Proposal

 



51  will be deemed a breach of this clause (iii)); (iv) fail to publicly
recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer other than
the Offer within ten (10) Business Days of the commencement of such offer; or
(v) resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such actions (each such
foregoing action or failure to act in clauses (i) through (v) being referred
to as a " _Change in Company Board Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company Board may, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time,
take any of the actions set forth in Section 5.4(e)(i) and Section 5.4(e)(ii)
below; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to taking any such action, the
Company complies with Section 5.4(f) of this Agreement:

 

(i) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to an
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from or arise in connection with a
breach of this Section 5.4, if the Company Board concludes in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside counsel, that failure to take
such action would or would be reasonably likely to be a breach of
its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law and
the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside
counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and

(ii) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(j)
in order to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement, but only if (A) the
Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from or arise in
connection with a breach of this Section 5.4, that the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside counsel, constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (B) the Company Board concludes in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to terminate this
Agreement and enter into such definitive agreement would or would be
reasonably likely to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys
shareholders under applicable Law and (C) concurrently with such termination
the Company pays the Termination Fee to Parent in accordance with Section 7.3.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 5.4(e), the
Company shall not be entitled to: (i) make a Change in Company Board
Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.4(e)(i); or (ii) terminate this
Agreement in order to enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement pursuant to
Section 5.4(e)(ii), unless: (A) the Company shall have first provided at least
three (3) Business Days prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to
(1) make a Change in Company Board Recommendation (a " _Recommendation Change
Notice_ ") or (2) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(j)
in response to a Superior Proposal (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ "), which
notice shall contain a description of the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal, including a copy of the Company Acquisition Agreement
in the form to be entered into (it being understood and agreed that the
delivery of such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Change
in Company Board Recommendation); (B) during such three (3) Business Day
period, if requested by Parent, the Company has engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that would,
in the good-faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with the
Companys outside counsel and the Companys financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation), cause the offer previously constituting a Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and (C) at the end of
such three (3) Business Day period in respect of a proposed Change in Company
Board Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.4(e)(i) or a proposed

 



52  termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 5.4(e)(ii), such
Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and the Company Board determines
in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal, taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement agreed to or proposed by Parent in response to a Recommendation
Change Notice or Superior Proposal Notice, as a result of the negotiations
required by the preceding clause (B) or otherwise. Any material changes to the
financial terms of such Superior Proposal occurring prior to the Companys
effecting a Change in Company Board Recommendation or terminating
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(j) shall require the Company to
provide to Parent a new Recommendation Change Notice or Superior Proposal
Notice and a new three (3) Business Day period during which the Company must
comply with clauses (A) through (C) of this Section 5.4(f).

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making
any disclosure required under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
this Section 5.4(g) shall not affect the obligations of the Company and the
Company Board and the rights of Parent and Purchaser under Section 5.4(e) and
Section 5.4(f) of this Agreement, to the extent applicable to such disclosure
(it being understood that no "stop, look and listen" letter or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act to the Companys shareholders that is required to be made to such
shareholders under applicable Law shall be deemed to be a Change in Company
Board Recommendation; _provided, however_ , that if any such disclosure does
not concurrently and expressly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation or if
it has the effect of withdrawing, or of qualifying or modifying in a manner
adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the Company Board Recommendation, then such
disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change in Company Board Recommendation).

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board may
effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation if, (i) the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and the Companys financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) that the failure to effect a Change in Company Board
Recommendation would or would be reasonably likely to be a breach of
its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law and
(ii) prior to effecting a Change in Company Board Recommendation, the Company
shall have first (A) provided Parent, with at least three (3) Business
Days prior written notice, a Recommendation Change Notice describing in
reasonable detail the reasons for such Change in Company Board Recommendation;
(B) during such three (3) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, engaged
in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a
manner that the failure to affect a Change in Company Board Recommendation
would not or would not be reasonably likely to be a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law; and (C) at the end
of such three (3) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined
in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
the Companys financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the
failure to effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation would still or
would still be reasonably likely to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
Companys shareholders under applicable Law.

 



53 5.5 Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

(a) Each party shall make or cause to be made, in cooperation with the other
parties and to the extent applicable and as promptly as practicable (and in
any event within five (5) Business Days) after the Agreement Date: (i) an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Offer and the Merger; and (ii) all other necessary
filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations and notices with
other Governmental Bodies under any other antitrust, competition, trade
regulation (including Japanese Foreign Exchange Law), or other Law relating to
the Offer and the Merger, in each case as Parent may deem necessary. Each
party shall promptly: (A) respond at the earliest practicable date to any
requests for additional information made by any Governmental Body; (B) act in
good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection with
any investigation by any Governmental Body; (C) furnish to each other all
information required for any filing, form, declaration, notification,

foregoing: (1) whenever possible, each party shall give the other party
reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed
understanding or agreement with, any Governmental Body regarding any filings,
forms, declarations, notifications, registrations or notices, and permit the
other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
of the other in connection with, any proposed communication, understanding or
agreement with any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger, subject to
advice of such partys antitrust counsel; (2) where reasonably practical,
none of the parties hereto shall independently participate in any meeting or
conversation, or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental
Body in respect of any filings or inquiry without giving the other party
prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such
Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend and/or participate; (3) if one
party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Body
from participating in or attending any meetings, conferences or conversations,
the attending party shall keep the other reasonably apprised with respect
thereto; and (4) the parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any information or proposals submitted in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any antitrust Laws.

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in
doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective, as promptly
as practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from all Governmental
Bodies and other third parties, and make all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings with all Governmental Bodies, that are necessary to
consummate the Offer and the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof to agree to any requirement to divest, license or hold
separate by itself or any of its Affiliates shares of capital stock or any
business, assets or property, or the imposition of any limitation on the
ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own or exercise control
of such business, assets, properties and stock. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent agrees to cause Purchaser to satisfy all of its obligations
under this Section 5.5.

 



54 5.6 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except as permitted in
accordance with Section 5.4, Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give each other the
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to the Offer and the Merger and consider in
good faith the views of the other party, and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant
to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange or trading
market on which securities of Parent or the Company are listed, in which case
the party required to make the release or announcement shall use reasonable
best efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it being
understood that the final determination of the disclosure requirements under
applicable Law shall be made by the disclosing party after consultation with
its outside counsel). 

5.7 Director and Officer Liability.

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Company, Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to: (i) indemnify and
hold harmless, against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) to
the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement
of expenses as of the Agreement Date by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to the Company Charter Documents in existence on the date hereof that
are made available to Parent; and (ii) include and cause to be maintained in
effect in the Companys or the Surviving Corporations (or any successors),
as the case may be, charter and bylaws for a period of six (6) years
after the Closing Date, provisions regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers and directors and advancement of
expenses to officers and directors that are at least as favorable as those
contained in the Company Charter Documents. If the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, or any of their respective successors or
assigns shall: (A) consolidate with or merge into any other corporations or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger; or (B) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then and
in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth
in this Section 5.7.

 

(b) The Company shall, prior to the Expiration Date, purchase a six (6) year
"tail" prepaid policy on the same terms and conditions as the existing
directors and officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by the
Company, covering, without limitation, the Offer and the Merger; _provided_ ,
that the cost of such "tail" policy shall in no event exceed 300% of the
amount of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such existing
directors and officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance.

 



55 (c) Parent shall cause the Company, Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to assume, honor and fulfill all
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any written
indemnification agreements with the indemnified parties, or any other person
entitled to the benefit of this Section 5.7, as applicable, identified on
Part 3.12(a)(vii) of the Disclosure Schedule.

5.8 Notification of Certain Events. Each of the Company and Parent shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, notify the other:

(a) upon becoming aware: (i) that any representation or warranty made by it
in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect;
(ii) of any failure of such Person to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement; or (iii) of the occurrence or non-occurrence of
any event that is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions in
Annex A not being satisfied;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warrant
of such party set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of the
other party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Offer and the Merger), or the remedies available to the parties hereto;

(b) of any written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is required in connection with the Offer or the Merger;

have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any Section of this
Agreement.

date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1: (a) the Company
shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any shareholder litigation against
the Company or its directors relating to this Agreement, the Offer or the
Merger and shall keep Parent fully informed regarding any such shareholder
litigation; and (b) the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate at Parents expense in the defense or settlement of any such
shareholder litigation and shall not settle any such shareholder litigation
without the prior written consent of Parent.

5.10 Rule 14d-10. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company (acting through
its compensation committee of independent directors) shall take all such steps
as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 14d-10(d) promulgated
under the Exchange Act any employment compensation, severance or other

TERMINATION

 

7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the Required
Shareholder Vote:

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, upon written notice to the other party,
if the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred on or prior to the close of
banking business, Pacific time, on September 21, 2012 (the " _Outside Date_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that a party shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) if the failure of the
Acceptance Time to occur by the Outside Date is caused by a failure of such
party to perform or comply in all material respects with any of its covenants
or obligations under this Agreement;

  



57 (c) by either Parent or the Company, upon written notice to the other party,
if the Offer shall have expired or been terminated in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement without any Shares being purchased thereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) if the failure of the Shares to be
purchased is caused by failure of such party to perform or comply in all
material respects with any of its obligations or covenants under this
Agreement;

 

(d) by either Parent or the Company, upon written notice to the other party,
if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Body shall have
issued a final and non-appealable order, writ, injunction, judgment, decree or
ruling, or shall have taken any other action, having the effect of permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for
payment of, and payment for, the Shares pursuant to the Offer or consummation
of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(d) shall not be available to a party if the
issuance of such final, non-appealable Restraint is caused by a failure of
such party to perform or comply in all material respects with any of its
obligations or covenants under this Agreement; and _provided_ further that the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement shall have used its reasonable best
efforts to prevent the entry of and to remove or lift such order, writ,
injunction, judgment, decree or ruling;

(e) by Parent, upon written notice to the Company, at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, if a Triggering Event shall have occurred;

 

(f) by Parent, in the event that, following the Agreement Date, there shall
have occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect (whether or not events or
circumstances occurring prior to the Agreement Date caused or contributed to
the occurrence of such Company Material Adverse Effect), which is not, or
cannot be, cured by the earliest of the date that is thirty (30) days
after written notice thereof is provided by Parent to Company, the Outside
Date or the Expiration Date (taking into account any extensions thereof
described in Section 1.1(d));

(g) by Parent, upon written notice to the Company, if, prior to the Acceptance
Time: (i) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with any of its obligations or covenants under this Agreement; or
(ii) any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in Article III of
this Agreement shall have been inaccurate when made or, if not made as of a
specific date, shall have become inaccurate, that would, in either case,
result in the Offer Conditions set forth in clauses (c) or (d) of paragraph 2
of Annex A not being satisfied, and in the case of both clauses (i) and (ii),
such breach is not curable, or, if curable, is not cured by the thirtieth
(30th) calendar day after notice thereof;

(h) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent, if: (i) Purchaser fails to
commence the Offer in violation of Section 1.1 hereof; (ii) Purchaser
terminates or makes any material change to the Offer in violation of the terms
of this Agreement; or (iii) at any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, if
all of the Offer Conditions are satisfied, Purchaser fails to accept for
payment and pay for Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer;

(i) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent, if, prior to the Acceptance
Time: (i) Parent shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with any of its obligations or covenants under this Agreement; or
(ii) any representation or warranty

 



58  of Parent and Purchaser set forth in Article IV of this Agreement shall have
been inaccurate when made or shall have become inaccurate, that would, in
either case, have a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or
Purchaser to consummate the Offer and the Merger, and in the case of both
clauses (i) and (ii), such breach is not curable, or, if curable, is not cured
by the thirtieth (30th) calendar day after notice thereof; or

(j) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent, if, at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time, the Company Board determines to enter into a definitive
Company Acquisition Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal and the
Company has complied with all of the provisions of Section 5.4, and shall
concurrently with such termination enter into the Company Acquisition
Agreement and pay to Parent the Termination Fee. Any purported termination
pursuant to this Section 7.1(j) that is not in compliance with the
requirements of this Section 7.1(j) shall be null and void and of no effect. 

7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect and the parties shall be relieved of all rights and obligations
hereunder, whether accrued, contingent or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (a) the provisions of Section 5.6 (Public Announcements), Section 5.11
(Confidentiality), this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article VIII shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and
effect and (b) such termination shall not relieve any party from liability
for any fraud or willful breach of its representations or warranties or
covenants hereunder. For purposes of this Section 7.2, a breach is "willful"
if it is the consequence of an act undertaken by the breaching party with the
knowledge (actual or constructive) that the taking of such act would, or would
be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

7.3 Expenses; Termination Fee.

(a) Expenses. Except as set forth in Section 5.5 and Section 7.3(b), all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) shall be paid by the
party or parties, as applicable, incurring such expenses whether or not the
Offer and the Merger are consummated.

(b) Termination Fee.

 

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(e), the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee no later
than the second (2nd) Business Day following such termination.

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 7.1(j), prior and as a condition to the effectiveness of such
termination, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee.

 

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by (A) Parent or the
Company pursuant to (1) Section 7.1(b) or (2) Section 7.1(c) and at the time
of termination under Section 7.1(c) the Minimum Condition is not satisfied, or
(B) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(g), and at or prior to the termination
of this Agreement under clause "(A)" or clause "(B)", a Third Party or the
Company shall have publicly disclosed that such Third Party has made, or is

 



59  considering making, an Acquisition Proposal, then: (y) within two (2)
Business Days of such termination, the Company shall pay to Parent an amount
in cash equal to all reasonable documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
experts and consultants and the costs of all filing fees and printing costs)
incurred by Parent or its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement, the
Offer or the Merger up to, but not exceeding $1,000,000 (the " _Parent
Expenses_ "); and (z) if within twelve (12) months after the date of
termination of this Agreement the Company enters into a definitive agreement
providing for, or consummates, a transaction within the scope of the
definition of "Acquisition Transaction," then the Company shall within two (2)
Business Days after the entry into such definitive agreement, or concurrently
with the consummation of such transaction, whichever is earlier, cause to be
paid to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to the Termination Fee _less_ any Parent Expenses previously reimbursed
by the Company.

(iv) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(c) and at the time of termination the Minimum
Condition is not satisfied, and the Company is not otherwise required to make
any payment to Parent under Section 7.3(b)(iii), then within two (2) Business
Days of such termination, the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to
the Parent Expenses.

(c) All payments under Section 7.3(b) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.

(d) The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that the provisions of Section
7.3(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger), and that, without such provisions,
Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company
shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to Section
7.3(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that
results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent its
reasonable costs and expenses (including its reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the amounts set forth in Section 7.3(b) at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

(e) In the event that Parent shall receive the Termination Fee or Parent
Expenses, as applicable, such receipt shall be deemed to be liquidated damages
for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, any of its
Affiliates, or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment
hereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of
Parent, any of its Affiliates, or any other Person shall be entitled to bring
or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, or any matters forming the basis for
such termination.

8.1 Amendment or Supplement. Subject to applicable Law, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and
all respects, whether before or after receipt of the Required Shareholder
Vote, by written agreement signed by all of the parties hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that following approval of this Agreement by the Companys
shareholders, there shall be no amendment of or change to the provisions of
this Agreement which, pursuant to applicable Law, would require further
approval by the Companys shareholders without receipt of such approval.

8.2 Extension of Time, Waiver, etc. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any party may, subject to applicable Law: (a) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of any other party hereto; (b) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party
hereto; or (c) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance by
the other party with any of the agreements contained in this Agreement or,
except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, waive any of such partys
conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company,
Parent or Purchaser in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver of rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such rights
preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or the exercise of any
other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

8.3 No Survival. None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement
or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the
Expiration Date. This Section 8.3 shall not limit the survival of any covenant
or agreement of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement which by its
terms contemplates performance after the Expiration Date.

8.4 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiary. This Agreement, including
the exhibits and annexes hereto, the Disclosure Schedule and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement
is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to create any agreement of
employment with any Person, to confer any rights or remedies upon any Person
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto, except with
respect to: (a) following the Acceptance Time, the rights of holders of Shares
to receive the Offer Price for Shares that were validly tendered and not
withdrawn and, following the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration as
provided in Article I and Article II, and, following the Acceptance Time, the
rights of holders of Company Options to receive the consideration described
in Article II; and (b) the directors and officers of the Company covered by
Section 5.7.

8.5 Applicable Law; Jurisdiction. Except to the extent that the WBCL must
mandatorily govern the terms of the Merger, this Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise

 



61  govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws. All actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation,
validity or performance of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger shall be
heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any court of the United States located in the State of
Delaware), and the parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such
courts (and, in the case of appeals, the appropriate appellate court
therefrom), in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding.
The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have
no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not
be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. The
parties agree that service of any court paper may be made in any manner as may
be provided under the applicable Laws or court rules governing service of
process in such court. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable Law. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT.

8.6 Specific Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof or are otherwise breached, and that the party
seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party under this
Agreement shall, prior to the termination of this Agreement, be entitled to
specific performance and the issuance of injunctive and other equitable relief
to prevent any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. The parties
hereto further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other
equitable relief, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

 

8.7 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Parent
and Purchaser may assign, in their sole discretion, any or all of their
rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any one or more
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent without the consent of
the Company, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Purchaser of any
of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

8.8 Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed duly delivered: (a) four (4) Business Days after

Agreement) (this clause (b), the " _Minimum Condition_ ").

2\. Additionally, notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the
Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject

67  illegal in any jurisdiction; (ii) any order, judgment, decree or injunction
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) shall be issued or granted (or

be taken by a Governmental Body that seeks any of the consequences referred to
in clauses (i) through (v) inclusive of paragraph 2(b) of this Annex A;

not true and correct as of the Expiration Date, as though made on and as of
the Expiration Date, except (A) that the accuracy of representations and
warranties that by their terms speak as of the date of the Agreement or some
other date will be determined as of such date and (B) where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be true and correct (without giving
effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Company Material
Adverse Effect") would not reasonably be expected to result in, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 3.1 (Due
Organization; Subsidiaries), Section 3.3 (Authority; Binding Nature of
Agreement), Section 3.26 (Fairness Opinion), Section
