Section 2.8 _Procedures for Assumption of Agreements; Delayed Transfer of
Assets_.

 



 

(a) (1) On or prior to the date hereof, the Sellers have delivered Schedule
2.8(a) to the Purchasers, which Schedule contains with respect to each
Contract and Lease of any Seller, Sellers good-faith estimate of the amount
required to be paid with respect to each Contract and Lease to cure all
monetary defaults under such Contract or Lease to the extent required by
Section 365(b) and otherwise satisfy all requirements imposed by Section 365
of the

 



      
 

 



 

Bankruptcy Code (such specified amounts, the " _Cure Costs_ "). To the extent
requested by Purchasers, the Sellers shall commence appropriate proceedings
before the Bankruptcy Court and otherwise take all reasonably necessary
actions in order to determine Cure Costs with respect to any Assumed Contract
or Assumed Lease entered into prior to the Petition Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to the Closing, Wanxiang may identify any Assumed Contract or
Assumed Lease as one that Wanxiang no longer desires to have assigned to it or
a Wanxiang Designee in accordance with _Section 2.9_.

 



 

(i) At the Closing, the Sellers shall assume and assign to Wanxiang and/or, as
applicable, one or more Wanxiang Designees the Assumed Contracts and Assumed
Leases, in each case pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and the
Sale Order, subject to provision by Purchasers of adequate assurance as may be
required under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and payment by Purchasers of
the Cure Costs in respect of the Assumed Leases and Assumed Contracts. The
Cure Costs in respect of all of the Assumed Leases and Assumed Contracts shall
be paid (or otherwise satisfied) by Purchasers.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
that the sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance or delivery or attempted sale,
transfer, assignment, conveyance or delivery to Wanxiang and/or, as
applicable, one or more Wanxiang Designees of any asset that would be a
Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom is prohibited by any applicable Law
or would require any Consent from any Governmental Authority or any other
third party (after giving effect to the Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code)
and such Consents shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, the
Closing shall proceed without the sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance or
delivery of such asset (and without reduction in the Purchase Price) unless
there is a failure of one or more of the conditions set forth in _Article
VI_, in which event the Closing shall proceed only if each failed condition is
waived by the Party entitled to the benefit thereof. In the event that any
failed condition is waived and the Closing proceeds without the transfer or
assignment of any such asset, then following the Closing, the Purchasers and
the Sellers shall use their respective reasonable best efforts, and cooperate
with each other, to obtain promptly such Consent. Pending such Consent, the
Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other to provide Purchasers and
the Wanxiang Designees with all of the benefits of use of such asset free of
any cost or expense. Once Consent for the sale, transfer, assignment,
conveyance or delivery of any such asset not sold, transferred, assigned,
conveyed or delivered at the Closing is obtained, the Sellers shall promptly
transfer, assign, convey and deliver such asset to Wanxiang and/or, as
applicable, one or more Wanxiang Designees at no additional cost or expense.
To the extent that any such asset cannot be transferred or the full benefits
or use of any such asset cannot be provided to Wanxiang and/or, as applicable,
one or more Wanxiang Designees following the Closing but in any event no later
than the date that is 90 days after the Closing pursuant to this _Section
2.8(b)_, then, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall enter into such
arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide
to the Parties hereto the economic (taking into account Tax costs and
benefits) and operational equivalent of obtaining such Consent. The Sellers
shall hold in trust for, and pay to Wanxiang and/or, as applicable, one or
more Wanxiang Designees, promptly upon receipt thereof, all income, proceeds
and other monies received by the Sellers derived from its use of any asset
that would be a Purchased Asset in connection with the arrangements under this
_Section 2.8(b)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If, following the Closing, any Seller receives or becomes aware that it
holds any asset, property or right which constitutes a Purchased Asset, then
Sellers shall transfer such asset, property or right to Wanxiang and/or, as
applicable, one or more Wanxiang Designees as promptly as practicable for no
additional consideration.

 



 

(d) If, following the Closing, Wanxiang receives or becomes aware that it
holds any asset, property or right which constitutes an Excluded Asset, then
Wanxiang shall transfer such asset, property or right to the Sellers as
promptly as practicable for no additional consideration.

 



 

(e) If, following the Closing, any Seller or Wanxiang becomes aware that any
of the Excluded IP was necessary for the operation of the Sellers Business as
operated as of the Closing Date, then Sellers shall immediately take all such
actions as may be required to obtain or grant a license to Wanxiang for such
Excluded IP, subject to any rights of Third Parties in such Excluded IP,
including without limitation obtaining necessary Consents therefore as
promptly as practicable for no additional consideration; provided, however,
that any Excluded IP that constitutes ITAR-Controlled Assets will be expressly
excluded from any such license to Wanxiang.

 



 

Section 2.9 _Additional and Eliminated Assumed Contracts_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Wanxiang may, in its sole and
absolute discretion, amend or revise Schedules 1.2(a) and 1.2(b) of the
Purchaser Schedule setting forth the Assumed Contracts and the Assumed Leases,
respectively, in order to add or eliminate any Contract or Lease to such
Purchaser Schedule up to one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date (the "
_Designation Deadline_ ") and, for any particular Assumed Contract or Assumed
Lease that will be assumed in whole or in part by a Wanxiang Designee, to
identify such Wanxiang Designee; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) subject to
the last sentence of this _Section 2.9_, the Sellers may terminate or reject
any Contract set forth on Schedule 2.9 to the Disclosure Letter at any time
whether prior to or after the Designation Deadline; and (b) Wanxiang may not
amend or revise Schedules 1.2(a) and 1.2(b) of the Purchaser Schedule after
the date hereof to add any Contract or Lease to such Purchaser Schedule if
Sellers have provided written notice to Wanxiang no later than the date hereof
that Sellers have reached an agreement in principle with a Third Party to
assign, transfer or sell such Contract or Lease to such Third Party (it being
understood that no Contract or Lease that has already been designated as a
Purchased Asset may be the subject of any such agreement in principle).
Automatically upon the addition of any Contract to Schedule 1.2(a) of the
Purchaser Schedule or Lease to Schedule 1.2(b) of the Purchaser Schedule, it
shall be an Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease, as applicable, for all purposes
of this Agreement. Automatically upon the deletion of any Contract from
Schedule 1.2(a) of the Purchaser Schedule or deletion of any Lease from
Schedule 1.2(b) of the Purchaser Schedule (any such deleted Contract or Lease,
an " _Eliminated Agreement_ "), it shall be an Excluded Agreement for all
purposes of this Agreement, and no Liabilities arising thereunder shall be
assumed or borne by the Purchasers. If Wanxiang indicates in writing to
Sellers after the Closing Date that it wishes to acquire a Contract or Lease
of any Seller that was not an Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease on the Closing
Date and that Sellers have not reached any agreement in principle with a Third
Party to assign, transfer or sell such Contract or Lease to such Third Party,
then the Sellers will, subject to reaching an agreement with Wanxiang
regarding consideration therefor, if any, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to assign such Contract or Lease to Wanxiang; _provided_ ,

 



      
 

 



 

 _however_ , that nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to obligate the
Sellers to retain, or refrain from rejecting or terminating any Contract after
the Designation Deadline that does not constitute an Assumed Contract or
Assumed Lease. With respect to each Assumed Contract and Assumed Lease,
Wanxiang and, as applicable, the Wanxiang Designees shall provide adequate
assurance of the future performance of such Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease
by Wanxiang and, as applicable, such Wanxiang Designees. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Sellers shall not be obligated to assume and
assign any Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease with respect to which Purchasers
fail to satisfy the Bankruptcy Court as to adequate assurance of future
performance (collectively, if any, the " _Non-Assured Contracts_ ") and
Purchasers obligation to close the Transactions shall not be conditioned upon
the transfer and assignment to Purchasers of any such Non-Assured Contracts.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) Sellers shall not reject,
repudiate or terminate any license or Contract in respect of Intellectual
Property Rights and (ii) other than licenses or Contracts in respect of
Intellectual Property Rights (treatment of which is governed by clause (i) of
this sentence), Sellers shall not reject, repudiate or terminate any Contract
or Lease that may potentially constitute or implicate any Purchased Asset
unless (A) Sellers shall provide Purchaser at least five (5) Business Days
prior written notice of such potential rejection, repudiation or termination
(which notice shall specify the Contracts or Leases to be rejected and include
a true and complete copy of such Contracts or Leases) and (ii) Purchaser has
not objected to such rejection, repudiation or termination.

shall be applied against the Purchase Price at Closing and disbursed to the
Sellers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the CFIUS Escrow
Agreement. Except as set forth in _Section 2.10(d)_, if this Agreement shall
be terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the CFIUS Deposit, together with any
interest earned thereon, shall be delivered to the Purchasers in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the CFIUS Escrow Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by Sellers pursuant to _Section 8.1(j)_,
the CFIUS Deposit, shall be delivered to the Sellers in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the CFIUS Escrow Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.11 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Purchasers shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amount as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable U.S. federal, state or local or foreign laws. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by a Purchaser, such deducted
and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Sellers or other Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Purchaser.

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**

 



 

Section 4.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Sellers_. Except as set
forth in the correspondingly numbered Schedules of the Disclosure Letter
delivered as of the date hereof by the Sellers to Purchasers (the "
_Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being understood that any matter disclosed in any
Schedule of the Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be disclosed in any other
Schedule of the Disclosure Letter to the extent that it is readily apparent on
the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other
Schedule), the Sellers hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to
the Purchasers as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date except insofar
as such representations and warranties are made as of the date hereof or any
other specified date (in which case as of such date), as follows:

 



 

(a) Each Seller and each Foreign Subsidiary is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization. Each A123 Entity has all requisite power and authority to own,
lease, develop and operate the Purchased Assets and to carry on its business
as now being conducted (subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code).
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Material
Adverse Effect, each A123 Entity is duly licensed or qualified to do business
in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned or leased by it or the
operation of its business makes such licensing or qualification necessary.

 



 

(i) Schedule 4.1(a)(i) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth for each Foreign
Subsidiary the amount of its authorized capital stock (or share capital), the
amount of its outstanding capital stock (or share capital) and the record (or
registered) and beneficial owners of its outstanding capital stock (or share
capital), and there are no other shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of any Foreign Subsidiary issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding. All of the issued shares, outstanding equity securities and other
securities of each Foreign Subsidiary are owned of record (or legally) and
beneficially by Sellers or by another Foreign Subsidiary, and all such
securities are included in the Purchased Assets or are owned by one or more
Foreign Subsidiaries, in each case free and clear of all Encumbrances. No
legend or other reference to any purported Encumbrance appears upon any
certificate representing any shares of any Foreign Subsidiary. All the
outstanding shares of capital stock or membership interests of each Foreign
Subsidiary are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and

 



      
 

 



 

nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation of any purchase
option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription
right or any similar right under any provision of applicable Law, the
Organizational Documents of any Foreign Subsidiary or any Contract to which
any Foreign Subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound. There are no Convertible
Securities of any Foreign Subsidiary authorized, issued or outstanding. There
are not any outstanding contractual obligations of any Foreign Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock, membership
interests, partnership interests, joint venture interests or other equity
interests in any Foreign Subsidiary.

 



 

(ii) Schedule 4.1(a)(ii) sets forth a true and complete list of all capital
stock, membership interests, partnership interests, joint venture interests
and other equity interests in any Person (other than a Foreign Subsidiary)
owned, directly or indirectly, by Sellers or any Foreign Subsidiary.

 



 

(iii) No Foreign Subsidiary is insolvent or unable to pay its debts, including
its future and prospective debts. No Foreign Subsidiary has proposed or
intends to propose any arrangement of any type with its creditors or any group
of creditors whether by court process or otherwise under which such creditors
shall receive or be paid less than the amounts contractually or otherwise due
to them. No Foreign Subsidiary nor any director, secretary or creditor of any
Foreign Subsidiary has presented any petition, application or other
proceedings for administration, creditors voluntary arrangement or similar
relief by which the affairs, business or assets of the company concerned are
managed by a person appointed for the purpose by a Court, governmental agency
or similar body, or by any director, secretary or creditor or by the company
itself nor has any such order or relief been granted or appointment made. No
order has been made, petition or application presented, resolution passed or
meeting convened by any Foreign Subsidiary for the purpose of winding-up such
Foreign Subsidiary or whereby the assets of any Foreign Subsidiary are to be
distributed to creditors or shareholders or other contributories of such
Foreign Subsidiary. No order has been made, petition or application presented,
resolution passed or meeting convened by any other Person for the purpose of
winding-up any Foreign Subsidiary or which the assets of such Foreign
Subsidiary are to be distributed to creditors or shareholders or other
contributors of any Foreign Subsidiary.

 



 

(iv) A123 Systems holds directly or indirectly all of the capital stock and
other ownership interests of each of the other Sellers and each Foreign
Subsidiary. Other than as described in the preceding sentence, no A123 Entity

interest in any Person other than the Joint Venture, or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any capital stock or other
ownership interests in any Person, (ii) has any obligation to acquire any
capital stock or other ownership interests in any Person, or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any capital stock or other
ownership interests of any Person, or to make any investment in any Person, or
(iii) is a party to any partnership, limited liability company, joint venture
or similar agreement. A123 Systems Hong Kong, Ltd. owns 49% of the equity
interest in Shanghai Advanced Traction Battery Systems Co. (the " _Joint
Venture_ "). A123 Systems Hong Kong, Ltd. has no assets or Liabilities other

 



      
 

 



 

than its equity interest in the Joint Venture and is not otherwise bound by
any contract, agreement or understanding. A123 Systems Hong Kong, Ltd. has
satisfied all of its material obligations with respect to the Joint Venture.
True, accurate and complete copies of the governing documents of each Foreign
Subsidiary and the Joint Venture and any Contracts involving or relating to
the equity interests or governance of the Joint Venture have previously been
provided to Purchasers. All Books and Records of each Foreign Subsidiary (A)
are up-to-date in all material respects, (B) are maintained at its registered
office in accordance with applicable Laws on a consistent basis in all
material respects, and (C) contain accurate records of all material matters
required to be dealt with in such Books and Records.

 



 

(b) Each Seller has all requisite corporate or limited liability company power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the Transactions (subject, in the case of the obligation to
consummate the Transactions, to the entry of the Sale Order). Subject to the
entry of the Sale Order, the execution, delivery and performance by each
Seller of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of
the Transaction have been duly and validly authorized by all requisite
corporate or limited liability company action on the part of each Seller and
no other corporate or limited liability company proceeding on the part of any
Seller is necessary to authorize this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or
to consummate the Transaction. This Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement
have been (or will be) duly and validly executed and delivered by each Seller
and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by all parties
hereto and thereto, other than the Sellers) constitute (or will constitute)
legal, valid and binding obligations of each Seller enforceable against each
Seller in accordance with their respective terms (subject, in the case of the
obligation to carry out the Transaction, to the entry of the Sale Order).

 



 

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by each Seller of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements do not, and the consummation by each Seller of
the Transaction, upon entry of the Sale Order, will not, (i) conflict with or
result in the breach of any provision of the organizational documents of any
A123 Entity, (ii) conflict with, violate or result in the breach by any A123
Entity of any applicable Law, (iii) require any A123 Entity to make any filing
with or give notice to, or obtain any Consent from, any Governmental
Authority, other than the Sale Order and, if required, any clearance under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR
Act_ ") or any notification requirements pursuant to 22 CFR 122.4(b) of the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), (iv) conflict with, violate,
result in the breach or termination of or the loss of a benefit under, or
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, payment or acceleration)
or adverse modification of any terms or rights under, any Assumed Contract,
Assumed Lease or Permit (subject, in the case of the assumption and assignment
to Wanxiang or any Wanxiang Designee of any Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease
or Permit that by its terms requires consent to assignment, to the entry of
the Sale Order and the terms and conditions of this Agreement), or (v) result
in any Encumbrance (except for Permitted Encumbrances) on any of the Purchased
Assets; other than, in the case of the foregoing subclauses (iv) and (v), any
of the foregoing that would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Since January 1, 2012 through the date of this Agreement, there is not
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened, an Action against an
A123 Entity that, individually or in the aggregate, would constitute a
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) All commodities, software and/or technologies conveyed as part of the
Purchased Assets are controlled by the Department of Commerce under the Export
Administration Regulations and are either classified "EAR99" or are subject to
anti-terrorism controls only, except as specified in Schedule 4.1(e). A123
Entities do not hold any export control, strategic goods or embargo license,
agreement, permit, approval or other authorization issued by any U.S.
Governmental Authority or any foreign Governmental Authority.

 



 

(f) Other than (i) the Purchasers, (ii) pursuant to any bids made by any
Person in connection with the Auction, or (iii) prior to the Closing Date, any
A123 Entity, no Person has any written or oral agreement or option, right of
first refusal, right of first offer, right of first negotiation or similar
right for the purchase, sale, use or other disposition of all or any of the
Purchased Assets.

 



 

(g) Schedule 4.1(g) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all material leases, subleases and other occupancy contracts,
including all amendments in respect of real property to which any A123 Entity
is a party (whether as lessee or lessor) (collectively, the " _Leased Real
Property_ ") and all real property owned by any A123 Entity (collectively, the
" _Real Property_ "). No A123 Entity owns any real property or occupies any
material real property other than the Leased Real Property, except in
accordance with the agreements set forth on Schedule 4.1(g) with respect to
Leased Real Property. No Person that is not an A123 Entity has any right to
possess, use or occupy the Real Property. With respect to the Assumed Leases,
a Seller has (x) a valid leasehold interest in the Leased Real Property and
(y) valid title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, the material tangible
personal property constituting Purchased Assets, free and clear of
Encumbrances (except for Permitted Encumbrances). Seller has valid fee simple
title in all Real Property, except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(g). Sellers
have, and, immediately prior to Closing, will have, and, upon delivery to
Purchasers on the Closing Date of the instruments of transfer contemplated by
the required closing deliveries, and subject to the terms of the Sale Order,
Sellers will thereby transfer to Purchaser, good title to, or, in the case of
personal property leased by Sellers, a valid leasehold interest in, all of the
Purchased Assets material to the Sellers Business, free and clear of all
Encumbrances, except for the Assumed Liabilities and for Permitted
Encumbrances. The Purchased Assets together with the assets of the Foreign
Subsidiaries constitute all assets used or held primarily for use by Sellers
and their Affiliates in, and necessary and sufficient for, the operation of
the Sellers Business as operated as of the Petition Date. None of the ITAR-

the Assumed Liabilities. The books and records of the Foreign Subsidiaries
have been maintained in material compliance with applicable Law and accounting
requirements and fairly reflect, in all material respects, all dealings and
transactions of the Foreign Subsidiaries.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Attached as Schedule 4.1(i)(i) of the Disclosure Letter is a schedule of

Authorities required for operation of the Sellers Business or the Joint
Venture (the " _Permits_ "). Each Permit is in full force and effect, the A123
Entities are in compliance in all material respects with their terms and
conditions, all required renewal applications have been timely filed, no
notice has been received by a Governmental Authority to revoke any material
Permit and no proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers,
threatened to revoke or limit any Permit required for the operation of the
Sellers Business or the Joint Venture.

 



 

(j) Since January 1, 2009, the A123 Entities have been in compliance with all
applicable Laws except for such non-compliance that would not have a Material
Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no A123 Entity has received
a written (or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, non-written) notice of any
investigation or review by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Purchased Assets, the Foreign Subsidiaries (and their assets), or the Real
Property that is pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened. As
of the date hereof, except for the Seller Chapter 11 Cases and as set forth on
Schedule 4.1(j) of the Disclosure Letter, there is no Action or Order pending,
outstanding or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened against any Seller that (a)
seeks to restrain or prohibit or otherwise challenge the consummation,
legality or validity of the Transactions, (b) would reasonably be expected to
be material to the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities or to the assets
and liabilities of the Foreign Subsidiaries or (c) could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2009, there has
not been made or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened, any material product
liability or other material product-related claims by any third party arising
from the sale, design, distribution or manufacturing with respect to the
safety of the products manufactured or sold by any A123 Entity and, to
Sellers Knowledge, there are no material safety concerns with respect to any
such products.

 



 

(k) Schedule 4.1(k)(i) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all material Contracts of any A123 Entity or with respect to
which any Purchased Assets is bound or subject. Schedule 4.1(k)(ii) of the
Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and accurate list of all Leases (the
Contracts and Leases described in this sentence and the immediately preceding
sentence together, the " _Scheduled Agreements_ "). Since January 1, 2009, (1)
there has not been any written (or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, non-written)
claim or allegation by any Person that any A123 Entity is in material breach
or default under any Scheduled Agreements or that there exists an event or
condition which (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) would result
in a material breach or default by any A123 Entity under any Scheduled
Agreements, and (2) to the Knowledge of the Sellers, neither the Sellers nor
any other party to any Scheduled Agreement is in material breach or default
thereunder. As of the date hereof, no party to a Scheduled Agreement has
provided any A123 Entity with written notice (or, to the Knowledge of the
Sellers, notice) that it intends to cancel, terminate, fail to renew or
materially reduce business conducted under any Scheduled Agreement. Except to
the extent that a Scheduled Agreement is rejected, repudiated or terminated by
Sellers after the execution of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, each of the Scheduled Agreements is in full force and effect
and is valid and binding on the A123 Entity party thereto and, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, each other party thereto. The Sellers have made
available to the Purchasers complete and accurate copies of each Scheduled
Agreement, together with any and all amendments, supplements and modifications
thereto.

Liability for brokerage or finders fees or agents commissions or other
similar payment in connection with the Transaction (a " _Seller Broker Fee_
"), except for any Seller Broker Fee payable to Lazard Freres and Co. LLC or
Alvarez and Marsal. None of the Purchasers nor any Affiliate of a Purchaser, nor
any Foreign Subsidiary, will have any Liability in connection with any Seller
Broker Fee or any other brokerage or finders fees or agents commissions or
other similar payment in connection with the Transaction incurred by any A123
Entity.

 



 

(m) The use by the A123 Entities of the Real Property is in material
compliance with all Environmental Laws. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, the
Real Property is in compliance with Environmental Laws, including any
Environmental Permits, except for such non-compliance that individually or in
the aggregate would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date
of this Agreement, (i) no A123 Entity is subject to any pending or, to the
Sellers Knowledge, threatened Action alleging that an A123 Entity may be in
material violation of any Environmental Law or Environmental Permit, or may
have any material Liability under any Environmental Law; and (ii) no A123
Entity has stored, treated, disposed of, arranged for disposal or treatment
of, transported, handled, manufactured, distributed, or released any Hazardous
Substance on, under or from the Real Property, except in material compliance
with Environmental Laws. Sellers have delivered or made available to Purchaser
complete and accurate copies of all material environmental reports, audits,
and assessments prepared by or for the Sellers that are in the Sellers
possession, as well as all material correspondence with Governmental
Authorities or other Persons relating to environmental conditions or
environmental compliance matters at the facilities and the properties of
Seller and concerning the operation of the business of the A123 Entities.

 



 

(n) As of the date of this Agreement, no A123 Entity has received any written
notice of any, and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, there is no threatened or
pending, eminent domain, condemnation or rezoning proceedings, or any sale or
other disposition in lieu of eminent domain or condemnation, with respect to
the Real Property or any part of the Real Property or for the relocation of
roadways or streets providing access to or egress from the Real Property.

 



 

(o) Sellers own and have valid title to, or the right to use in connection
with their business as conducted prior to the Petition Date, all of the
Purchased IP and all other Intellectual Property Rights used in their
business, and no A123 Entity other than the Sellers owns or licenses any of
Intellectual Property Rights. None of the Excluded IP has been or is used in
the business of the A123 Entities as conducted prior to the date hereof other
than the USG Business. There are no Intellectual Property Rights that do not
constitute Purchased IP but are used in the business of the A123 Entities,
other than the Excluded IP which is used solely in the USG Business.

 



 

(i) Schedule 4.1(o)(i) sets forth a true and complete list of all U.S. and
foreign Intellectual Property Rights owned (whether in whole or in part) by or
licensed to or used by Sellers that are issued, pending or registered,
including all registered Purchased IP (marked as such), as well as any
Excluded IP, in each case indicating which A123 Entities own or have rights to
use such Intellectual Property Rights and with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to which businesses of A123 Entities such Intellectual Property Rights
are used or are relevant.

 



 

(ii) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(o)(ii), Sellers have all right, title
and interest in and to the Intellectual Property Rights designated as owned by
Sellers on Schedule 4.1(o)(i), free and clear of all Encumbrances other than
Permitted Encumbrances. All current and former employees of the A123 Entities
have assigned to the A123 Entities all Purchased IP that such employees have
created while in the scope of their employment, including copyrights in works
made for hire and patents.

 



 

(iii) Schedule 4.1(o)(iii) sets forth each Contract with respect to Purchased
IP pursuant to which the A123 Entities have granted or are obligated to grant
any Person the right to license, reproduce, distribute, market, use or exploit
such Intellectual Property Rights or otherwise granted covenants not to sue,
releases or immunities regarding such Intellectual Property Rights.

 



 

(iv) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(o)(iv), all registered Intellectual
Property Rights of Seller are in full force and effect, and have not been
abandoned or passed into the public domain, and all necessary registration,
maintenance and renewal documentation and fees in connection with such
Intellectual Property Rights have been timely filed with the appropriate
authorities and paid. Sellers have in place commercially reasonable policies
and procedures, consistent with industry standards, to maintain the secrecy of
all trade secrets included in their Intellectual Property Rights. The A123
Entities are not using any registered Intellectual Property Rights in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to result in the cancellation or
unenforceability of such Intellectual Property Rights.

 



 

(v) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(o)(v), (A) there are no Actions before
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Intellectual Property Rights of
any A123 Entity or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, any Actions before any
Governmental Authority with respect to Intellectual Property Rights which are
otherwise used in the business of the A123 Entities, (B) there is no Action
pending, or to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened that challenges the
validity of ownership or use of any Purchased Assets, and (C) to the Knowledge
of Sellers, there exists no state of facts and circumstances that would result
in any such challenge that is material to the business of the Sellers being
successful or which would be reasonably likely to result in a material
liability or otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(vi) To the Knowledge of the Sellers, no third partys operations or products
infringe on the Purchased IP in any material respect. To the Knowledge of the
Sellers, the operation of the business of the A123 Entities does not infringe
in any material respect on the Intellectual Property Rights of any other
Person. No A123 Entity has received, or been threatened with, during the
three-year period preceding the date of this Agreement, any written (or, to
the Knowledge of Sellers, non-written) claim of infringement with respect to
any Purchased IP.

 



      
 

 



 

(p) Upon the consummation of the Closing, Buyer shall succeed to all of
Sellers rights and interest in or under the Purchased IP, and all of Sellers
rights under the Intellectual Property Rights that constitute the Purchased IP
shall be exercisable by Purchasers to the same extent as by Sellers prior to
the Closing. The execution, delivery and performance by Sellers of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, will not give rise to any right
of any third party to terminate or re-price or otherwise modify any of its
rights or obligations under any agreement under which any right or license is
granted under any of the Purchased IP.

 



 

(q) Schedule 4.1(q) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete list of all
material insurance policies with respect to which an A123 Entity is a party, a
named insured or otherwise the beneficiary of coverage with respect to any of
the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities. The Purchased Assets have
been insured against risks normally covered by insurance policies by companies
carrying on business of a similar nature as each of the A123 Entities. There
is no material claim with respect to any Purchased Asset by an A123 Entity
pending under any such policies which has been denied or disputed by the
insurer. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, all such insurance policies are in
full force and effect, all premiums due and payable thereon have been paid,
all material terms and conditions of such policies have been complied with,
and no written notice of cancellation or termination has been received by the
A123 Entities with respect to any such policy which is not replaceable by the
A123 Entities or on substantially similar terms prior to the date of such
cancellation.

 



 

(r) All material Tax Returns required to be filed by each Seller or any of its
Affiliates (with respect to the Sellers Business, the Purchased Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities) or by or on behalf of each Foreign Subsidiary have been
timely filed (taking into account extensions validly obtained), (ii) all such
Tax Returns were true, correct and complete in all material respects, and
(iii) all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns and any other material Taxes
of any Seller or its Affiliates (with respect to the Sellers Business, the
Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities) or the Foreign Subsidiaries have
been timely paid other than Taxes being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been established in
accordance with GAAP in the Financial Statements or, for periods beginning
after June 30, 2012, the Books and Records of A123 Systems. During the last
five years, no claim has been made in writing by any taxing authority in a
jurisdiction where any Seller or any of its Affiliate or the Foreign
Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that such Seller or its Affiliate (with
respect to the Sellers Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities) or the Foreign Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by
that jurisdiction. Each Seller and its Affiliates (to the extent relating to
the Sellers Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities) and
the Foreign Subsidiaries have withheld and paid to the relevant taxing
authority all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor,
creditor, stockholder or other third party. No audit, administrative
proceeding or judicial proceeding that involves a material amount of Tax of
any Seller or its Affiliates (with respect to the Sellers Business, the
Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities) or the Foreign Subsidiaries is
pending or threatened in writing. There are no Encumbrances for Taxes on the
Purchased Assets or any property of the Foreign Subsidiaries other than
statutory Encumbrances for Taxes not yet due and payable. None of the
Purchased Assets or property of the Foreign Subsidiaries is "tax exempt use
property" within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code or subject to any
lease made pursuant to Section 168(f)(8) of the

 



      
 

 



 

Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Other than the equity interest in the Foreign
Subsidiaries and the Joint Venture, the Purchased Assets do not include,
directly or indirectly, any equity interests in any corporation, partnership,
limited liability company or other entity nor is any Purchased Asset required
to be treated as such for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each of the
Foreign Subsidiaries and the Joint Venture is characterized as a foreign

method of accounting under Section 481(c) of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state, local or foreign law) on or prior to the Closing

of any federal, state, local or foreign statutes of limitation has been
granted with respect to the assessment of any material Taxes of the Sellers or
its Affiliates (to the extent relating to the Sellers Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities) or the Foreign Subsidiaries, which waiver
or extension has not since expired. Each of the Foreign Subsidiaries (i) has
not participated in a "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b), (ii) has not granted to any Person a power of
attorney that is currently in force with respect to any Tax matter, (iii) has

and their Affiliates (with respect to the Sellers Business, the Purchased
Assets, or the Assumed Liabilities) or the Foreign Subsidiaries has requested
or received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or other material
ruling in respect of Taxes, in each case, which would bind the Purchases or
their Affiliates (including the Foreign Subsidiaries) after the Closing. There
are no Tax allocation, Tax sharing or Tax indemnification agreements or other
similar arrangements pursuant to which the Foreign Subsidiaries would be
liable after the Closing for Taxes of any other Person.

 



 

(s) Subject to the entry of the Sale Order and any order approving the
assumption and assignment of the Assumed Contracts and Assumed Leases, the
Sellers have complied with all requirements of the Bankruptcy Code and Federal
Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure in connection with obtaining approval of the
sale of the Purchased Assets (including the assumption and assignment to
Wanxiang and/or, as applicable, one or more Wanxiang Designees of any Assumed
Contracts and the Assumed Leases) to Wanxiang and/or, as applicable, one or
more Wanxiang Designees pursuant to this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

(t) During the period beginning on September 30, 2009 to the date of this
Agreement, there has not been any material damage to the Purchased Assets that
are tangible assets and used in the business of the A123 Entities in respect
of which the Sellers are entitled to insurance proceeds, condemnation awards
or other compensation. Inventory that is finished goods or samples is in good
and marketable condition in all material respects and is reasonably saleable
in the ordinary course of business.

 



 

(u) The Financial Statements present fairly in all material respects, the
consolidated financial condition of A123 Systems as of the dates set forth
therein, and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the
periods covered thereby, in conformity with GAAP (subject, in the case of the
Unaudited Financial Statements, to the absence of notes and normal year-end
audit adjustments and to any other adjustments set forth therein). There is no
outstanding guarantee, indemnity, suretyship or security (whether or not
legally binding) given by or for the benefit of the Foreign Subsidiaries.
Schedule 4.1(u) sets forth unaudited consolidation schedules in respect of
each of the Unaudited Financial Statements described in clause (a) of the
definition of Unaudited Financial Statements (the " _Consolidation Schedules_
"). The Foreign Subsidiaries do not have any material liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether absolute or contingent, asserted or
unasserted, known or unknown, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, and
whether or not accrued), except (i) as disclosed, reflected or reserved
against in the Consolidation Schedules related to the Foreign Subsidiaries,
(ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2012 and not in
violation hereof.

 



 

(v) Set forth on Schedule 4.1(v) is a list of all suppliers of any A123 Entity
or subcontractors of any products of or relating to the Sellers Business and
indicates whether any such suppliers or subcontractors is the sole or primary
supplier of any significant product, service or other tangible or intangible
property or license rights to the Sellers.

 



 

(w) Since January 1, 2012, no Material Adverse Effect has occurred. From June
30, 2012 through the date of this Agreement, except as set forth on Schedule
4.1(w), Sellers have not taken any action that would have required the consent
of Purchasers under _Section 5.1_ if taken after the date hereof.

 



 

(x) The Sellers have delivered or made available to the Purchasers a true,
correct and complete copy of each writing constituting a part of each U.S.
Benefit Plan and Foreign Benefit Plan maintained for the benefit of a Service
Provider, including all plan documents, employment agreements, employee
communications, summary plan descriptions, benefit schedules, trust
agreements, and insurance contracts and other funding vehicles. Except as
provided pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, there are no
amendments to any U.S. Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan maintained for the
benefit of a Service Provider that have been adopted or approved nor have the
Sellers undertaken to make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any new
U.S. Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan. A123 Systems Hong Kong, Ltd. has no
employees and has never had any employees.

 



 

(y) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Sellers have made available
(or will make available within two (2) Business Days of the date hereof) to
the Purchasers a list of all employees employed in the conduct of the business
of the A123 Entities as of the date

 



      
 

 



 

specified therein, including the following information for each such employee:
(i) name and location; (ii) part-time or full-time status; (iii) title, job
description and responsibilities; (iv) employment commencement date; (v)
annual base salary or hourly wage; (vi) available bonus or other contingent
compensation; (vii) accrued and unused vacation days; (viii) accrued and
unused sick days; (ix) if on leave, the status of such leave (including reason
for leave and expected return date); (x) whether such employee is employed
under an employment contract or on an at-will basis; and (xi) whether such
employee has or had any responsibilities, involvement, or connection with
respect to any of the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

(z) Since January 1, 2009, with respect to the employees of the A123 Entities,
there has not been, there is not presently pending or existing, and, to the
Knowledge of the Sellers, there is not threatened any material charge,
grievance proceeding or other claim against any A123 Entity (or any director,
officer, manager or employee thereof) relating to the actual or alleged
violation of any applicable Law pertaining to labor relations or employment
matters, including any charge or complaint filed by an employee or union with
the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission or any comparable Governmental Authority. To the Knowledge of
Sellers, no Seller has a material claim, whether asserted or unasserted,
against any current or former employee of an A123 Entity. Sellers believe
their relations with their employees are good. As of the date hereof, no
officer of any A123 Entity has notified any Seller that such officer intends
to leave or otherwise terminate such officers employment with Sellers. No
employee of any A123 Entity, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, is, or is now
expected to be, in violation of any material term of any employment contract,
confidentiality, disclosure or proprietary information agreement, non-
competition agreement, or any other contract or any restrictive covenant, and
the continued employment of each such employee does not subject any A123
Entity to any liability with respect to any of the foregoing matters.

 



 

(aa) No A123 Entity has been, nor is any now, a party to any collective
bargaining agreement, union recognition agreement or other labor contract or
employs any member of a union. There is not pending or existing, and to the
Knowledge of the Sellers, there is not threatened, any strike, slowdown,
picketing, work stoppage or employee grievance process involving any A123
Entity. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, there is no organizational activity
or other labor dispute against any A123 Entity, and no application or petition
for an election of or for certification of a collective bargaining agent is
pending. There is not in effect any lock-out, relating to a labor dispute, by
any A123 Entity of any employee (or group thereof), and no such action is
contemplated by any A123 Entity.

 



 

(bb) Each A123 Entity has in all material respects complied, and is in
material compliance, with all laws and regulations in respect of wages and
employment (including the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("
_WARN_ ") and all similar state, local and foreign laws). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each individual who renders services to any A123
Entity who is classified by such A123 Entity as having the status of an
independent contractor or other non-employee status for any purpose (including
for purposes of taxation and tax reporting and under U.S. Benefit Plans and
Foreign Benefit Plans) is properly so characterized.

 



      
 

 



 

(cc) Each of Sellers and each of the Foreign Subsidiaries has in respect of
each of its employees complied in all material respects with its obligations
under applicable Law. Each Seller and each of the Foreign Subsidiaries has
made all material payments due in respect of salaries, wages, commissions,
bonuses, provident fund, pension, retirement benefits, gratuity, layoff, leave
encashment, overtime pay, medical and workmens compensation and any other
compensation element forming part of the compensation package with respect to
the employees or any comparable payments relevant under any particular
applicable Law. There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that
could result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of
the Foreign Subsidiaries or any of its ERISA Affiliates and that could result
in liability to Wanxiang or any of its Affiliates (including, following the
Closing, the Foreign Subsidiaries).

 



 

(dd) All Foreign Benefit Plans (i) have been maintained in all material
respects in accordance with applicable Law, (ii) that are intended to qualify
for special Tax treatment meet all material requirements for such treatment,
and (iii) that are required to be funded and/or book reserved are funded
and/or book-reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial
assumptions and in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

(ee) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transaction will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event)
result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase
the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any Service Provider, or
result in any limitation on the right of the Sellers to amend, merge,
terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any U.S. Benefit Plan or
Foreign Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the
form of benefits) by the Sellers in connection with the Transaction (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of the Transaction in conjunction
with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code.

 



 

(ff) Schedule 4.1(ff) sets forth all functions and responsibilities of each of
the Excluded Personnel as of the date hereof, other than functions and
responsibilities performed solely in connection with the USG Business.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Representations and Warranties of the Purchasers_. The Purchasers
represents and warrants to the Sellers as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date except insofar as such representations and warranties are made as
of the date hereof or any other specified date (in which case as of such date)
as follows:

 



 

(a) Each Purchaser is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite power
and authority to own, lease, develop and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as now being conducted.

 



 

(b) Each Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the Transactions
(subject, in the case of the obligation to consummate the Transaction, to the
entry of the Sale Order). The execution,

 



      
 

 



 

delivery and performance by each Purchaser of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transaction have been duly and validly authorized by all
requisite corporate action on the part of each Purchaser, and no other
corporate proceeding on the part of either Purchaser is necessary to authorize
this Agreement and to consummate the Transaction. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by each Purchaser and (assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by all parties hereto and thereto other
than the Purchasers) constitutes (or will constitute) legal, valid and binding
obligations of each Purchaser, enforceable against each Purchaser in
accordance with its terms (subject, in the case of the obligation to carry out
the Transaction, to the entry of the Sale Order).

 



 

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by each Purchaser of this
Agreement does not, and the consummation by each Purchaser of the Transaction
will not, (i) conflict with or result in the breach of any provision of the
organizational documents of any Purchaser, (ii) conflict with, violate or
result in the breach by any Purchaser of any applicable Law, (iii) require any
Purchaser to make any filing with or give notice to, or obtain any Consent
from, any Governmental Authority, other than the Sale Order and, if required,

filings with CFIUS, or (iv) conflict with, violate, result in the breach or
termination of or the loss of a benefit under, or constitute (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, payment or acceleration) or adverse modification of
any terms or rights under, any contract to which any Purchaser is party; other
than, in the case of the foregoing subclause (iv), any of the foregoing that
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
materially impair any Purchasers ability to consummate the Transaction.

 



 

(d) No Purchaser has incurred any Liability for brokerage or finders fees or
agents commissions or other similar payment in connection with the
Transaction (a " _Purchaser Broker Fee_ ") that would be payable by any A123
Entity.

 



 

(e) Each Purchaser acknowledges and affirms that it has completed its own
independent investigation, analysis and evaluation of the Purchased Assets,
that it has made all such reviews and inspections of the Purchased Assets as
it deems necessary and appropriate, and that in making its decision to enter
into this Agreement and consummate the Transaction, it has relied on its own
investigation, analysis, and evaluation with respect to all matters without
reliance upon any express or implied representations or warranties except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Each Purchaser will have, at the Closing, the resources and capabilities
(financial or otherwise) to perform its obligations hereunder, including
payment of the Purchase Price. Wanxiang has not incurred any obligation,
commitment, restriction or liability of any kind that would materially impair
Wanxiangs ability to satisfy its payment and funding obligations under this
Agreement.

Sellers to the Purchasers as a result of any breach of such warranties,
representations or covenants. In connection with the Purchasers access to the
Books and Records, the Purchasers shall be accompanied at all times by a
Representative of the Sellers unless the Sellers otherwise agree, shall not
materially interfere with the use and operation of the offices and other
facilities of the Sellers, and shall comply with all reasonable safety and
security rules and regulations for such offices and other facilities. Sellers
shall promptly make available to Purchasers any and all documents (and
promptly advise Purchasers of the content of any orally conveyed information)
provided during the period from the date hereof through the date of the Sale
Order to any prospective purchasers of all or any part of the Purchased Assets
not previously provided to Purchasers. Any confidential information provided
to the Purchasers shall be deemed Confidential Information under the
Confidentiality Agreement and shall be subject to the terms thereof.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no access to, or examination
of, any information or other investigation by the Purchasers shall be
permitted to the extent that (i) it includes trade secrets or other
proprietary information, (ii) it is protected by attorney-client, work-
product, or similar privilege or doctrine or (iii) the disclosure of which is
prohibited pursuant to applicable Law.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing until the fifth anniversary of the Closing
Date, Wanxiang agrees to provide the Sellers with reasonable access to Books
and Records (and allow the Sellers to make extracts and copies of such Books
and Records during such access) in connection with the Seller Chapter 11 Cases
or any other proceeding or action relating thereto at the Sellers sole cost
and expense; _provided_ that Wanxiang will not be required to provide any such
access in connection with any Action by or against Wanxiang or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives. Any such access shall
be during regular business hours upon reasonable advance notice and in a
manner that minimizes disruption to the business, operations and activities of
Wanxiang. In connection with the Sellers access to the Books and Records, the
Sellers shall be accompanied at all times by a Representative of Wanxiang
unless Wanxiang otherwise agrees, shall not materially interfere with the use
and operation of the offices and other facilities of Wanxiang, and shall
comply with all reasonable safety and security rules and regulations for such
offices and other facilities. (1) No access to, or examination of, any
information or other investigation by the Sellers shall be permitted to the
extent that (i) it includes trade secrets or other proprietary information,
(ii) it is protected by attorney-client, work-product, or similar privilege or
doctrine or (iii) the disclosure of which is prohibited pursuant to applicable
Law or (iv) it includes disclosure of information other than Books and Records
as they existed on the Closing Date, and (2) Wanxiang will not be required to
preserve or otherwise retain any Books and Records beyond the time period
specified in this _Section 5.5(b)_. Nothing in this _Section 5.5(b)_ shall
require Wanxiang or any other Person to provide any testimony or evidence.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) From and after the date hereof until the date that is earlier of (i) the
second anniversary of the Closing Date, or (ii) the date on which Sellers have
ceased doing business or have sold, liquidated or otherwise disposed of all or
substantially all of their assets, Sellers will cooperate with Purchasers, at
Purchasers expense, in connection with Purchasers preparation of financial
statements that Purchaser will be required to file after the Closing Date
under applicable Law, including by cooperating with Purchasers in any effort
by Purchasers in procuring the consent of Sellers accounting firm after the
Closing Date to the inclusion of the Financial Statements and any interim
financial statements in any of Purchasers or Purchasers Affiliates periodic
reports, registration statements or private placement memoranda or other
filings or documents required under Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
_Section 5.5_ shall be deemed to require the Sellers to delay or otherwise
alter the completion of the Seller Chapter 11 Cases.

 



 

(d) From and after the Closing, Sellers shall keep confidential and not
disclose to any party unless required by Law or as may be necessary in
connection with the Seller Chapter 11 Cases, including in connection with
analyzing, objecting to, or settling any claim asserted therein, any retained
information, including Books and Records that the Sellers retain after the
Closing pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Use of Name_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing
(and in no event later than five Business Days after the Closing), Sellers
shall take all necessary action to cease using the A123 name in the Sellers
Business.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Disclaimer of Warranties_. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement, it is the explicit intent of each Party that the Sellers are
not making any representation or warranty, express or implied, beyond those
given in _Section 4.1_ or contained in any other Ancillary Agreement or
Closing Document, and it is understood that, except for such representations
and warranties, the Purchasers and any Wanxiang Designee take the Purchased
Assets "as is" and "where is." Without limiting the generality of the
immediately foregoing, except for the representations and warranties
specifically contained in _Section 4.1_ or in any other Ancillary Agreement
or Closing Document, the Sellers hereby expressly disclaim and negate any
representation or warranty, express or implied, at common law, by statute, or
otherwise, relating to the condition of the assets of the Sellers; it being
the intention of the Parties that the Purchased Assets are to be accepted by
the Purchasers and any Wanxiang Designee in their present condition and state
of repair.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Required Approvals_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and except as contemplated by this Agreement or the Sale Order, the
Parties shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to
be done all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Closing
and the Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable, including the
preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required
pursuant to applicable Law to be filed to consummate the Closing and the
Transactions and the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any
requisite approvals, authorizations, Consents, releases, orders, licenses,
Permits, qualifications, exemptions or waivers by any third party or
Governmental Authority. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Parties agree
that as

 



      
 

 



 

promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement,
the Parties shall make all premerger notification filings required under (i)
the HSR Act (which shall in any event be made within five (5) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement), (ii) the pre-merger notification rules in
any other jurisdiction in which the parties agree applicable Law requires a
premerger notification filing (which filing shall be made promptly following
such determination), and (iii) comply at the earliest practical date with any
request under the HSR Act for additional information, documents or other
materials received by each of them or any of their respective Affiliates from
the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice in respect of such filings, whether such request is formal or
informal. Subject to applicable Law, each such Party shall promptly inform the
other Parties hereto of any oral communication with, and provide copies of
written communication with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such
filings. No Party shall independently participate in any substantive meeting
or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry
without giving the other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend
and/or participate. Subject to applicable Law, the Parties will consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to proceedings under
the HSR Act or any other antitrust law. The Purchasers and Sellers shall each
be responsible for and shall pay 50% of all fees in respect of any required
premerger notification filings.

 



 

(b) The Parties shall use their best efforts to take all reasonable steps as
may be necessary to obtain an approval from, resolve any objection or
assertion by any Governmental Authority or to resolve an action or proceeding
by, any Governmental Authority, whether by judicial or administrative action,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transaction or the
performance of obligations hereunder under any antitrust law. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no Purchaser will be obligated to commit to the divestiture of
any assets or business of any Purchaser (or any Affiliate of a Purchaser) or
any Purchased Assets or to any limitations on the conduct of its business.

 



 

(c) Purchaser and Sellers shall use their best efforts to take all reasonable
steps as may be necessary to obtain CFIUS Approval. Purchaser and Sellers
shall consult with each other on strategic matters related to the CFIUS
review, and Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser in pursuing the course of
action that Purchaser, in good faith, believes to be optimal for purposes of
obtaining CFIUS Approval. Purchaser and Sellers shall keep each other
generally apprised of communications with, and requests for additional
information from, CFIUS with respect to the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement; provided, however, that Purchaser shall be responsible for, and
shall take the lead in, any communication with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the CFIUS review. If Sellers receive any request from any
Governmental Authority for supplemental information in connection with the
CFIUS review, Sellers shall, within two Business Days of such request and
unless directed to the contrary by the Government Authority, provide any such
requested information to Purchaser for review, and Sellers or Purchaser shall
provide such requested information to such Governmental Authority within one
Business Day after Purchaser receives such requested information from Seller.
If Purchaser receives any request from any Governmental Authority for
supplemental information in connection with the CFIUS review, Purchaser shall,
within three Business Days

 



      
 

 



 

of such request, provide any such requested information to such Governmental
Authority. Subject to Purchasers consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), Purchaser and Sellers shall take such
actions and agree to such conditions as may be requested or required by CFIUS
in connection with, or as a condition of, CFIUS Approval including, on the
part of Purchaser, agreeing to mitigation measures regarding the operation of
the Purchased Assets, the use of any Purchased IP, and the interaction of
Purchaser and/or the Purchased Assets with the USG Business as necessary to
assure the continued operation of the USG Business; provided, however, that in
no event shall Purchaser be required to agree to any term or take any action
in connection with the CFIUS Approval that reasonably would be expected to
materially and adversely affect the expected economic or commercial benefits
to Purchaser arising from the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(d) In addition, unless CFIUS Approval has been obtained or Purchasers receive
a letter from the Department of Treasury, written in its capacity as chair of
CFIUS and pursuant to the authorities in Section 721 of the Defense Production
Act, expressing CFIUS objection to the formation of the trust and the
consummation of the transactions as contemplated by Section 6.1(k)(ii),
Purchasers shall take all actions necessary for Purchasers to satisfy the
condition set forth in Section 6.1(k)(ii) by January 15, 2013.

 



 

(e) Sellers shall, subject to Purchasers consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), use their best efforts to take
all reasonable steps as may be necessary to resolve any request by DDTC for
the taking of any action necessary to ensure that ITAR-Controlled Assets are
fully excluded from the Transaction. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, in no event shall Purchaser be required to consent to any action
that would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the
expected economic or commercial benefits to Purchaser arising from the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Publicity_. Except as required by applicable Law (including any
Order by the Bankruptcy Court) or filings by the Sellers with, or in any
proceeding before, the Bankruptcy Court, neither Party shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, issue any press release, provide any notice to
customers or suppliers, or make any public announcement concerning this
Agreement or the Transaction without the other Partys consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld delayed or conditioned; _provided_ that the Sellers may
issue any such press release or make any such public announcement in
connection with the Auction after having provided the Purchasers at least one
(1) Business Day to review and comment on such release or announcement (which
comments shall be reasonably considered by the Sellers). Nothing in this
_Section 5.9_ shall prohibit any Party from making any public statement
without prior consultation of the other Party as may be required by applicable
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange.

 



 

Section 5.10 _[Intentionally Omitted]_.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Certain Matters Relating to Specified Employees_.

 



 

(a) No later than four (4) weeks after the date hereof, Wanxiang will notify
Sellers of the identity of the employees of Sellers and their Affiliates to
whom Wanxiang

 



      
 

 



 

(and/or, as applicable, one (1) or more Wanxiang Designees) intends to offer
employment (each, a " _Specified Employee_ ," and together, the " _Specified
Employees_ "), such offers to be made no later than five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date and to be effective as of the Closing Date, provided that no such
offer shall be made to any Excluded Personnel. Each such offer of employment
shall be subject to such compensation and other terms and conditions of
employment as Wanxiang shall determine in its sole and absolute discretion.
Each such Specified Employee who accepts an offer of employment from Wanxiang
or a Wanxiang Designee and is hired by Wanxiang or a Wanxiang Designee is
referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_."

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.11(a)_, nothing herein expressed or implied
shall confer upon any of the employees of any Seller or any Transferred
Employees any right to employment or continued employment for any specified
period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Neither Wanxiang, nor any Wanxiang Designee nor any Affiliate of Wanxiang
shall have any Liability whatsoever for (i) any compensation or other
obligations owing or purported to be owing to any Service Provider by any
Seller, including any severance, separation pay, change of control payments or
benefits, retention payments or any other payments or benefits arising in
connection with the termination of such Service Providers employment by or
services to any Seller, before, on or after the Closing Date, or (ii) any
Action under WARN by any past or present Service Provider (whether or not a
Transferred Employee) in connection with termination of employment with or
services to any Seller and its Affiliates (or any other "employment loss" or
similar action identified in WARN), including any plant closing or mass
layoff. As soon as reasonably practicable following Wanxiangs request,
Sellers shall reasonably provide Wanxiang with such information as is
reasonably necessary to determine whether any actions taken by Sellers or
their applicable Affiliates prior to, on or after the Closing Date will, if
aggregated with actions that may be taken by Wanxiang or its Affiliates after
the Closing Date, require the provision of notice or payment in lieu of notice
(whether under WARN or otherwise) to any individuals. To the extent requested
by Wanxiang between the date hereof and the Closing, Seller will promptly
deliver notices complying with WARN to Service Providers with respect to whom
such a request is made.

 



 

(d) Effective upon the Closing Date, each of the Sellers hereby waives, for
the benefit of Wanxiang and its Affiliates, any and all restrictions, if any,
in any U.S. Benefit Plan, Foreign Benefit Plan or Contract relating to (i)
non-competition with any A123 Entity, or (ii) maintenance of confidentiality
of any information for the benefit of any A123 Entity, in each case, with or
covering any Transferred Employee.

 



 

(e) To the extent that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility,
vesting or benefit accrual (other than with respect to any defined benefit
plan, program or arrangement) under any employee benefit or fringe benefit
plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by Wanxiang or its
Affiliates after the Closing in which Transferred Employees participate (a "
_Purchaser Benefit Plan_ "), such Purchaser Benefit Plan shall credit each
Transferred Employee for service on or prior to the Closing Date with the A123
Entities and their Affiliates to the same extent credited for such purposes
under the comparable U.S. Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan immediately
prior to the Closing; _provided_ that the foregoing shall

 



      
 

 



 

not apply (i) for purposes of any Purchaser Benefit Plan under which similarly
situated employees of Wanxiang and its Affiliates do not receive credit for
prior service, (ii) for purposes of any Purchaser Benefit Plan that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation, (iii) for purposes of level of severance payments or benefits
under any Purchaser Benefit Plan, or (iv) to the extent that its application
would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. Following the Closing, Wanxiang shall cause each Purchaser Benefit
Plan which is an "employee welfare plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA)
in which Transferred Employees participate (i) to reduce each such eligible
Transferred Employees (and his or her eligible dependents) annual deductible
limits under such plan for the plan year in which the Closing occurs to the
extent deductible expenses were incurred and recognized for comparable
purposes under the comparable U.S. Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) to the extent waived under the
comparable U.S. Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan in which Transferred
Employees participate immediately prior to the Closing, to waive any pre-
existing condition limitations or exclusions that do not apply to such
Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

(f) Subject to applicable Laws, the Sellers shall cooperate with Wanxiang and
shall permit Wanxiang and/or, as applicable, one or more Wanxiang Designees a
reasonable period during normal business hours prior to the Closing Date, (i)
to meet with Service Providers at such times as Wanxiang or a Wanxiang
Designee shall reasonably request, (ii) to speak with such Service Providers
managers and supervisors (in each case with appropriate authorizations and
releases from such Service Providers) who are being considered for employment
by Wanxiang or a Wanxiang Designee, (iii) to distribute to such Service
Providers such forms and other documents relating to potential employment by
or services to Wanxiang or a Wanxiang Designee after the Closing, and (iv)
subject to any restrictions imposed under applicable Law, to permit Wanxiang,
upon request, to review personnel files and other relevant employment
information regarding such Service Providers.

 



 

(g) Following the Closing, the Sellers and Wanxiang shall cooperate reasonably
with each other to provide an orderly administrative transition to Wanxiang
and/or, as applicable, one or more Wanxiang Designees of the Transferred
Employees, including the provision by the Sellers to Wanxiang of all necessary
or appropriate documents, records, materials, accounting files and Tax
information with respect to each Transferred Employee.

 



 

(h) Following the Closing, the Sellers shall retain all Liability to provide
health care continuation coverage under Section 4980B of the Code and Section
601 of ERISA for all MandA Qualified Beneficiaries (as that term is defined in
Treasury Regulations Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4) (who are not Transferred
Employees or qualified beneficiaries of Transferred Employees first claiming
COBRA benefits following a termination of employment with Wanxiang and its
Affiliates) so that neither Wanxiang nor any of its Affiliates is required by
applicable Law to provide COBRA continuation coverage to any of such MandA
Qualified Beneficiaries.

 



 

(i) Nothing in this _Section 5.11_ shall (i) be treated or construed as an
amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any benefit plan or (ii) be construed
to prohibit Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from amending or terminating
any benefit plan. The provisions of this _Section 5.11_ are solely for the
benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and

 



      
 

 



 

nothing in this _Section 5.11_, express or implied, shall confer upon any
Service Provider, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof or other
Person, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature
or kind whatsoever under this Agreement or a right in any employee or
beneficiary of such employee or other Person under a U.S. Benefit Plan,
Foreign Benefit Plan or Purchaser Benefit Plan that such Service Provider or
beneficiary or other Person would not otherwise have under the terms of such
plan.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) From the Closing Date until the fifth anniversary thereof, Seller and each
of its Affiliates shall not directly or indirectly engage or participate in
any business that competes directly with the Sellers Business (any such
business, a " _Competing Business_ ") or license any Excluded IP to any Person
(other than Purchaser or its Affiliates) for use in or within the scope of the
Sellers Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that it shall not be deemed to be
a violation of this _Section 5.12(a)_ for Seller or any of its Affiliates to,
directly or indirectly, (i) invest in or own or hold any non-voting and non-
convertible debt securities or other obligations of any Competing Business or
(ii) invest in or own or hold any equity interest in any Competing Business so
long as such Sellers or such Affiliates investment or interest is less than
five percent (5%) of the outstanding equity interests in such Competing
Business, is a passive investment only, and Seller or such Affiliate does not
exercise voting or other control over such Competing Business or participate
directly in such Competing Business, and (iii) own any equity interests
through any benefit plan or pension plan.

 



 

(b) From the date hereof until the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
Sellers and each of their Affiliates shall not hire or solicit for employment
any employee of the Purchasers or their Affiliates or any of the Specified
Employees; _provided_ , _however_ , the restrictions of this _Section
5.12(b)_ shall not apply to (i) any general solicitation in any newspaper,
website or other publication, or through any search firm engagement which, in
any such case, is not directed or focused on personnel employed by Purchasers
or (ii) the solicitation or hiring of any employee of Purchasers or their
Affiliates, whose employment has been terminated by Purchasers or their
Affiliates prior to the commencement of employment discussions with Seller or
the applicable Affiliate.

 



 

(c) From the date hereof until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not offer employment to or hire any
Excluded Personnel.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Avoidance Actions_. Sellers shall not pursue any litigation
claims or causes of action (including causes of action under Chapter 5 of the
Bankruptcy Code) (i) against landlords, vendors or other counterparties who
are party to (or Affiliates of a party to) any Assumed Contract or Assumed
Lease, or (ii) against any officer or employee retained by Purchasers or its
Subsidiaries after Closing, or (iii) otherwise arising under or related to the
Purchased Assets, including in each of cases (i), (ii) and (iii) such causes
of action arising under, or available pursuant to, the Bankruptcy Code.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Novation_. From and after the date hereof, purchasers of Funded
Property (as defined in the Sale Order) shall take all commercially reasonable
steps necessary as requested

 



      
 

 



 

by the United States to pursue final novation of the DOE Agreements (as
defined in the Sale Order).

 



 

Section 5.15 _Business Partners_. Sellers shall, following the reasonable
request thereof by Purchasers, seek and use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange meetings and telephone conferences with material
suppliers, customers, licensors, licensees or other business partners of
Sellers as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser and necessary and
appropriate for Purchaser to coordinate transition of such Persons following
the Closing.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Separation and Transition of the Excluded Business_. Sellers
shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain such services and
support, including without limitation engineering support services, supply
arrangements for fuel cells and future manufacturing services, as may be
necessary for the Excluded Business to operate as a stand-alone business after
the Closing. If Sellers are unable to procure any such services and support,
then Purchasers shall, to the extent reasonably requested by Sellers and only
pursuant to such terms and conditions as are agreed upon by the Committee on
Foreign Investment in the United States, provide such services and support to
Sellers on commercially reasonable terms mutually agreed among Purchasers and
Sellers for a reasonable term not to exceed two years after the Closing.

responsible for all

 



      
 

 



 

Transfer Taxes (and related costs, fees and expenses) imposed on or payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Party
responsible under applicable Law for filing a Tax Return relating to such
Transfer Taxes shall prepare and file such Tax Return and promptly provide a
copy of such Tax Return to A123 Systems or Wanxiang, as applicable. If any
Purchaser remits to the appropriate Governmental Authority payment for
Transfer Taxes which are subject to this _Section 7.4(a)_ in connection with
filing any such Tax Returns on behalf of and at the request of the Sellers,
the Sellers shall promptly reimburse such Purchaser for such Transfer Taxes
upon written notice from such Purchaser. The Sellers and Purchasers shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate to timely prepare and
file any Tax Returns or other filings relating to such Transfer Taxes,
including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or
imposition of any Transfer Taxes.

 



 

(b) _Purchase Price Allocation_. No later than 90 days following the Closing
Date, the Purchasers shall provide the Sellers with a proposed allocation of
the Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities among the Purchased Assets. If
the Sellers do not deliver a written notice disagreeing with the Purchasers
proposed allocation within 30 days following the Sellers receipt thereof, the
proposed allocation shall be final. If the Sellers deliver a written notice
disagreeing with the Purchasers proposed allocation within 30 days following
the Sellers receipt thereof, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such dispute within 30 days following the date of the
dispute notice. If the Sellers and the Purchasers are unable to resolve such
dispute within such 30-day period, they shall refer such dispute to an
independent accounting firm or appraisal firm jointly selected by the Parties,
whose determination shall be final and binding on the Sellers and the
Purchasers for all purposes of this Agreement. The final allocation of the
Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities among the Purchased Assets,
determined in accordance with this _Section 7.4(b)_, shall be set forth on a
written schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "). The expenses, fees and costs
of the independent accounting firm or appraisal firm shall be shared equally
between the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchasers, on the other hand.
The Sellers and the Purchasers agree to prepare and file any Tax Returns
required to be filed with any taxing authority (including Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594 and any comparable form under state, local, or foreign law)
in accordance with the Allocation Schedule, except to the extent otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code (or any comparable provision of state, local or foreign law).
Purchasers and Sellers shall not take any position contrary thereto or
inconsistent therewith in any audits or examinations by any Governmental
Authority or any other proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
contained herein shall prevent Purchasers or Sellers from settling any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon or
arising out of the Allocation Schedule and neither Purchasers nor Sellers
shall be required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or
adjustment by any Governmental Authority challenging such Allocation Schedule.

 



 

(c) _Property Taxes_. The Sellers shall be responsible for any Property Taxes
(including any special or supplemental assessments) with respect to any
Purchased Asset allocable to any taxable period or portion thereof ending on
or prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ") (without
regard to when such Taxes are assessed or payable). The Purchasers shall be
responsible for any Property Taxes (including any special or supplemental
assessments) with respect to any Purchased Asset allocable to any taxable
period or portion thereof ending after the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing
Tax Period_ ") (without regard to when

 



      
 

 



 

such Taxes are assessed or payable). If, following the Closing, one Party
remits to the appropriate Governmental Authority payment for Property Taxes
which are subject to this _Section 7.4(c)_ and such payment includes the
other Partys share of such Property Taxes, such other Party shall promptly
reimburse the remitting Party for its share of such Property Taxes upon
written notice from such paying Party; _provided_ that Purchasers shall not be
required to make any payment with respect to prepaid Property Taxes described
in _Section 2.1(_ _a_ _)_ _(vii)_. Any refund of Property Taxes which are
subject to this _Section 7.4(c)_ shall be allocated between the Sellers and
the Purchasers in a manner consistent with _Section 7.4(d)_.

 



 

(d) _Straddle Period Allocations_. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) Taxes
(other than Property Taxes) imposed on or with respect to the Sellers
Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities with respect to a
taxable period that commences prior to and includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") shall be allocated between the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period based on a "closing of the
books" method as of the end of the Closing Date; provided that that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax
Period in proportion to the number of days in each such period; and (ii)
Property Taxes for any Straddle Period shall be allocated between the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period in proportion to the number
of days in each such period.

 



 

(e) _Cooperation_. The Purchasers and the Sellers shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other, as promptly as reasonably practicable, such
information in their possession and assistance relating to the Sellers
Business, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as is reasonably
necessary for the preparation and filing of any Tax Return, claim for refund
or other filings relating to Tax matters, or in connection with any Tax audit
or other Tax proceeding.

 



 

(f) _Certain Other Tax Matters_. From the date hereof until the Closing:

 



 

(i) Without the prior written consent of Wanxiang, the Sellers shall not, and
shall not permit any of their Affiliates, (A) to make, change or revoke any
Tax election of the Foreign Subsidiaries, (B) change any method of reporting
income or deductions for Tax purposes of the Foreign Subsidiaries, (C) settle,
compromise or abandon any Tax liability of the Foreign Subsidiaries or any
Action in respect of Taxes of the Foreign Subsidiaries, or (D) file any
amended Tax Return of the Foreign Subsidiaries. In addition, the Sellers shall
keep Wanxiang timely and reasonably apprised of any Action in respect of Taxes
of the Foreign Subsidiaries.

 



 

(ii) With respect to any Tax Returns required to be filed prior to the Closing
by or on behalf of the Foreign Subsidiaries or the Joint Venture (the "
_Specified Tax Returns_ "), the Sellers shall prepare, or shall cause to be
prepared, all such Specified Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past
practice and this Agreement. Sellers shall deliver, or cause to be delivered
all such Specified Tax Returns to Wanxiang at least thirty (30) days prior to
the due date for filing such Specified Tax Returns (taking into account any
valid extensions) for Wanxiangs review and comment, and, after revising such
Specified Tax Returns to reflect any comments received from Wanxiang, Sellers
shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed, such Specified Tax Returns.
With respect to

 



      
 

 



 

the Specified Tax Returns of the Joint Venture, the Sellers shall be obligated
to take the actions otherwise required under this _Section 7.4(f)(ii)_ solely
to the extent the Sellers or any other A123 Entity is entitled to do so under
the relevant organizational documents of the Joint Venture,

 



 

(iii) Purchasers shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and
timely filed all Tax Returns of the Foreign Subsidiaries for the Straddle
Period that are required to be filed after the Closing Date. Wanxiang shall
provide A123 Systems a copy of each such Tax Return for its review and comment
at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the due date (including any
applicable extension) of such Tax Return, and Wanxiang shall consider in good
faith any written comments of A123 Systems received by Wanxiang within five
(5) Business Days prior to filing such Tax Return.

 



 

(g) _Section 338 Election_. The Purchasers and their respective Affiliates
shall be permitted to make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar election
under state, local or foreign law) with respect to the Foreign Subsidiaries.

any Party. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
termination of this Agreement shall not affect the rights or obligations of
the Parties under the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that (i) from and
after the date hereof, the provisions contained in the eighth, ninth and tenth
paragraphs thereof shall be of no further force and effect and (ii) from and

confidential all proprietary or other non-public information in its possession
concerning Purchasers and their Affiliates, the Sellers Business and the
Purchased Assets, and not disclose or provide access to such confidential

obligations under this _Section 8.2_ are inadequate and that, in addition
thereto, Purchasers shall be entitled to equitable relief, including
injunction and specific performance, in the event of any such breach, without
necessity of demonstrating the inadequacy of money damages.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(j)_ , Purchasers
shall forfeit the CFIUS Deposit and any interest thereon and same shall be
delivered to Sellers pursuant to _Section 2.10(d)_. The receipt of the CFIUS
Deposit shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Sellers in connection with
the failure of the Closing to occur and for any breach or default of
Purchasers of this Agreement (other than (i) prior to the termination of this
Agreement, specific performance and (ii) with respect to any covenant or
agreement required by this Agreement to be performed by Purchasers after the
Closing), and Sellers shall irrevocably waive and release the Purchaser
Parties (as defined in _Section 8.3(e)_ ), as a condition to receipt of the
CFIUS Deposit (but subject to the receipt thereof), from any and all
statutory, equitable, legal or common law claims or remedies that any Seller
may have against any of the Purchaser Parties in respect of any failure of the
Closing to have occurred or any breach of or default under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 8.3(d)_ shall limit the
amount of

 



      
 

 



 

Damages Sellers may recover as a result of failure by Purchasers to comply
with a court order directing Purchasers to specifically perform their
obligations under _Section 5.8(d)_.

 



 

(e) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section
8.1(k)_ , Purchasers shall forfeit the Purchase Price Deposit and any interest
thereon and deliver same to Sellers pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_. The receipt
of the Purchase Price Deposit shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Sellers for any breach or default of Purchasers of this Agreement (other than
(i) prior to the termination of this Agreement, specific performance and (ii)
with respect to any covenant or agreement required by this Agreement to be
performed by Purchasers after the Closing), and Sellers shall irrevocably
waive and release the Purchaser Parties, as a condition to receipt of the
Purchase Price Deposit (but subject to the receipt thereof), from any and all
statutory, equitable, legal or common law claims or remedies that any Seller
may have against any of the Purchaser Parties in respect of any breach of or
default under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 8.3(e)_ shall limit the amount of Damages Sellers may recover as a
result of failure by Purchasers to comply with a court order directing
Purchasers to specifically perform their obligations under _Section 5.8(d)_.
For purposes hereof, " _Purchaser Parties_ " shall mean, collectively, the
Purchasers and any of their respective former, current or future directors,
officers, employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers, members,
stockholders, Affiliates or assignees or any former, current or future
director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager,
member, stockholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing.

 



 

(f) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement,
that the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where Sellers are entitled to the Purchase Price Deposit are
uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that the delivery of the
Purchase Price Deposit is not a penalty but rather shall constitute liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Sellers in the
circumstances where Sellers are entitled to the Purchase Price Deposit for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these
agreements, Sellers would not enter into this Agreement. If the Purchasers
fail to take any action necessary to cause the delivery of the Purchase Price
Deposit pursuant to the Deposit Escrow Agreement under circumstances where
Sellers are entitled to the Purchase Price Deposit and, in order to obtain
such Purchase Price Deposit, Sellers commence a suit which results in a
judgment in favor of Sellers, the Purchasers shall pay to the Sellers an
amount in cash equal to the costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by Sellers in connection with such suit.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event and under no circumstances shall Purchasers forfeit, as a result of
termination of this Agreement or otherwise, both the Purchase Price Deposit
and the CFIUS Deposit, it being agreed that, except to the extent both the
Purchase Price Deposit and the CFIUS Deposit are applied at the Closing
towards the Purchase Price, if the Sellers are entitled to receive the
Purchase Price Deposit pursuant to this Agreement, they shall not be entitled
to receive the CFIUS Deposit, and if Sellers are entitled to receive the CFIUS
Deposit they shall not be entitled to receive the Purchase Price Deposit, and
concurrently with the Company receiving either the CFIUS Deposit

 



      
 

 



 

or the Purchase Price Deposit, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and other than the case that both the Purchase Price Deposit and the CFIUS
Deposit are applied at the Closing toward the Purchase Price, the other amount
shall be delivered to Purchasers.

 **INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

Section 9.1 _Survival_. All representations and warranties of any of the
Sellers contained herein shall survive the Closing until the date that is nine
(9) months after the Closing Date (the " _Survival Date_ "). No
Indemnification Claim (as defined below) may be asserted pursuant to _Section
9.2_ unless the applicable Notice of Claim (as defined below) is received by
A123 Systems on or prior to the Survival Date (it being agreed and understood
that if a claim for a breach of representation or warranty is timely made, the
representation or warranty shall, solely for the purposes of such claim,
survive until the date on which such claim is finally liquidated or otherwise
resolved). No representations and warranties of the Purchasers contained
herein shall survive beyond the Closing Date. This _Section 9.1_ shall not
limit any Partys liability for fraud.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Indemnification of Purchaser_. On and after the Closing Date, and
subject to the other provisions of this _Article IX_ (including the last
sentence of this _Section 9.2)_, each of the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be
indemnified and held harmless from and against any and all claims, demands,
suits, Actions, causes of actions, losses (including loss of profits, internal
costs, loss of revenue and lost sales), costs, damages, liabilities and out-
of-pocket expenses incurred or paid, including reasonable attorneys fees
(including such fees which are incurred in connection with a good-faith
dispute of the provisions of this Agreement), fines, penalties, costs of
investigation or settlement, other professionals and experts fees, and court
or arbitration costs (but specifically excluding any punitive, exemplary,
special or speculative damages except to the extent such damages specifically
excluded herein are awarded to a Third Party) (hereinafter collectively
referred to as " _Damages_ "), to the extent such Damages are suffered by a
Purchaser Indemnitee and arise out of, are the reasonably foreseeable result
of, or are caused by:

 



 

(a) any facts or circumstances that constitute an inaccuracy,
misrepresentation or breach of any of the Sellers representations or
warranties in _Section 4.1_;

 



 

(b) the breach of, default in, or failure to perform any covenant, agreement
or other obligation of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

(c) any Excluded Asset or Excluded Liabilities (it being understood that in no
event shall the Purchasers acquire any Excluded Assets or assume any Excluded
Liabilities); or

 



 

(d) if the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated prior to receipt
of CFIUS Approval using the trust structure described in Section 6.1(k)(ii),
any failure by Sellers to remove any ITAR-Controlled Assets from the assets
that are conveyed to Purchaser at Closing;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled
to any indemnification pursuant to clause (a) of this _Section 9.2_ unless
and until the total amount of Damages for all

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnification Claims for which the Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to be
indemnified under clause (a) of this _Section 9.2_ exceeds One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000), in which case the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be
entitled to all such Damages indemnifiable hereunder but in no event shall
indemnification in respect of such Damages exceed the Indemnification Escrow
Amount applicable at such time. The Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each
other Purchaser Indemnitee, acknowledges and agrees that the Indemnification
Escrow Account is the sole and exclusive source of funding for any
Indemnification Claims and under no circumstances shall any Purchaser
Indemnitees be entitled to indemnification in respect of Damages for such
Indemnification Claims other than from the Indemnification Escrow Account,
except to the extent Damages are incurred as a result of actual fraud of the
Sellers under this Agreement, with respect to which the limitations set forth
in this sentence shall not apply. For purposes of determining whether any
indemnification is provided under clauses (a) or (b) of this _Section 9.2_,
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations set
forth in this Agreement or in the Transaction Documents shall be read without
giving effect to any materiality, knowledge or "material adverse effect"
qualifiers in such provisions.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Notice of Claim_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after any Purchaser Indemnitee actually learns of any event or
circumstance (including any Action instituted or asserted by a Third Party (a
" _Third Party Claim_ ") against any Purchaser Indemnitee) that is reasonably
likely to give rise to indemnification under _Section 9.2_ (an "
_Indemnification Claim_ "), the Purchaser Indemnitee shall deliver to A123
Systems and such other Seller as Purchaser shall determine (the " _Primary
Seller Parties_ ") a notice executed by the Purchaser Indemnitee setting forth
in reasonable detail the matter giving rise to the Indemnification Claim
hereunder (such notice, a " _Notice of Claim_ "). The Purchaser Indemnitee
shall have the right to amend any Notice of Claim at any time.

 



 

(b) No delay on the part of any Purchaser Indemnitee in giving a Notice of
Claim shall limit or reduce such Persons right to indemnity hereunder, or
relieve the Sellers from any of their obligations under this _Article IX_,
unless (and then only to the extent that) the Sellers are actually prejudiced
thereby.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Resolution of Notice of Claim_. Each Notice of Claim given by any
Purchaser Indemnitee shall be resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) _Admitted Claims_. If the Primary Seller Parties agree in writing that
liability for an Indemnification Claim is indemnified under _Article IX_ for
the full amount of the Damages specified in the Notice of Claim or amendment
to Notice of Claim, or fail to give the Purchaser Indemnitee written notice
contesting all or any portion of a Notice of Claim within thirty (30) days
after such Notice of Claim (or amendment to any such Notice of Claim) is
properly delivered to each of the Primary Seller Parties pursuant to _Section
9.3_ of this Agreement, then the Sellers shall be conclusively deemed to have
consented to the recovery (subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
9.2_) by the Purchaser Indemnitee of the lesser of (i) the full amount of
Damages actually incurred by such Purchaser Indemnitee in respect of such
Indemnification Claim and (ii) the estimate of the anticipated Damages, if
any, specified in such Notice of Claim or amendment thereto, as applicable.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) _Contested Claims_. With respect to any Notice of Claim not involving a
Third Party Claim, if the Primary Seller Parties give the Purchaser Indemnitee
written notice contesting all or any portion of a Notice of Claim or any
amendment to a Notice of Claim, but solely with respect to any matters subject
to such amendment (a " _Contested Claim_ ") within thirty (30) days after
proper delivery to the Primary Seller Parties of such Notice of Claim or
amendment thereto pursuant to _Section 9.3_, then such Contested Claim shall
be resolved by either (i) a written settlement agreement executed by the
Primary Seller Parties and the Purchaser Indemnitee or (ii) in the absence of
such a written settlement agreement within thirty (30) days of the Sellers
delivery of a notice contesting the Notice of Claim or amendment thereto, all
Indemnification Claims that are the subject of such Notice of Claim or the
amendment thereto shall be resolved by a hearing of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
The foregoing dispute resolution procedures shall also apply with respect to
any disputes as between the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser or the
Purchaser Indemnitees, on the other, over whether the Purchaser Indemnitees
are entitled to indemnification for Damages resulting from a Third Party
Claim.

 



 

(c) _Participation in Defense of Third Party Claims_. In the event of a Third
Party Claim against any Purchaser Indemnitee for which an Indemnification
Claim has been made, the Sellers may, at their option, participate in the
defense of the Purchaser Indemnitee against the claims giving rise to such
Third Party Claim (including through the employment of its choice of counsel,
who shall be reasonably satisfactory to such Purchaser Indemnitee, it being
understood that the Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of the fees,
charges and disbursements of such counsel); _provided_ that (i) such
participation shall not limit the Purchaser Indemnitees control of such Third
Party Claim and (ii) the Sellers and their counsel shall cooperate with the
Purchaser Indemnitees and their counsel in connection with such Third Party
Claim. The applicable Purchaser Indemnitee(s) shall have the right to
undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing and at its
own expense (without prejudice to its right to recover all Damages in
accordance with this _Article IX)_, the defense of any Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event of any Third Party
Claim in respect of Taxes against the Sellers or their respective Affiliates
that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Sellers Business,
the Purchased Assets or the Purchasers or their respective Affiliates (a "
_Specified Third Party Tax Claim_ "), the Sellers shall keep the Purchasers
timely and reasonably apprised of the status of such Specified Third Party Tax
Claim.

 



 

(d) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_ _. _In the event that a Purchaser
Indemnitee shall compromise or settle any Third Party Claim without the
consent of A123 Systems (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), such compromise or settlement shall not be
dispositive with respect to the Damages payable to such Purchaser Indemnitee
in respect of such Third Party Claim but in no event shall the Damages payable
from the Indemnification Escrow Account to such Purchaser Indemnitee in
respect of such Third Party Claim exceed the amount of such compromise or
settlement. For so long as any amounts remain in the Indemnification Escrow
Account and subject to appropriate confidentiality and privilege protections,
in the event a Purchaser Indemnitee intends to compromise or settle multiple
claims with a Third Party and one or more of such claims is a Third Party
Claim against the Purchaser Indemnitee, the Purchaser shall inform A123
Systems, prior to seeking its consent to such settlement or compromise, of:
(i) the amount of all claims; (ii) the aggregate amount of such settlements or
compromises with the Third Party; and (iii) the amount of the settlement
allocated to each claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the

 



      
 

 



 

Sellers shall not settle or compromise, or permit their respective Affiliates
to settle or compromise, any Specified Third Party Tax Claim without the
consent of Wanxiang, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

(e) _Cooperation_ _. _From and after the delivery of any Notice of Claim
subject to appropriate confidentiality and privilege protections, the Sellers
and the applicable Purchaser Indemnitees shall make reasonably available to
the other party, as applicable, and their respective attorneys, accountants
and representatives all pertinent information under its control relating to
the applicable Indemnification Claim and amount of Damages incurred in
connection therewith, and the Sellers shall cooperate and, in the case of a
Third Party Claim against the Purchaser Indemnitees, render to the applicable
Purchaser Indemnitees such assistance as such Purchaser Indemnitees may
reasonably require in order to facilitate the proper and adequate defense of
any such Third Party Claim (including granting the applicable Purchaser
Indemnitees and their attorneys, accountants and representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the personnel of the Sellers
(including as witnesses or deponents at trial and during the discovery
process) to the extent reasonably related to the applicable Indemnification
Claim).

 



 

Section 9.5 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments; No Duplication of Damages_. All
indemnification payments under this _Article IX_ shall be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for all applicable Tax purposes, except as
is otherwise required by applicable Law. No Purchaser Indemnitee shall be
entitled to recover any amount due hereunder more than once in respect of the
same Damages, including receipt of third-party insurance proceeds in respect
of Damages indemnifiable under this _Article IX_. To this end, the amount of
any Damage for which a Purchaser Indemnitee claims indemnification under this
Agreement (A) shall be reduced by (i) the amount of any insurance proceeds
actually received by such Purchaser Indemnitee with respect to such Damage,
(ii) the amount of any Tax benefits actually realized with respect to such
Damage and (iii) payments provided by Third Parties to the Purchaser
Indemnitee with respect to such Damage, and (B) shall be increased by the
actual Tax costs of the Purchased Indemnitee on the receipt of any
indemnification payment.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Release of Remaining Indemnification Escrow Account Funds_. On
the Closing Date, Purchasers and Sellers shall jointly instruct the escrow
agent holding the Indemnification Escrow Amount to release to Sellers, as soon
as reasonably practicable following the Survival Date, all remaining funds in
the Indemnification Escrow Account, other than an amount of funds equal to the
alleged Damages for which a Notice of Claim has been delivered pursuant to
_Section 9.3_ (the " _Claimed Funds_ "). Any Claimed Funds shall be released
to Sellers immediately upon resolution of the applicable Indemnification
Claims.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Without limiting the Purchasers rights under
_Section 10.7_, after the Closing, Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy
against Sellers for any and all of the Purchasers claims and Damages under
this Agreement shall be the rights of indemnification set forth in this
_Article IX_ only, and the Purchasers will have no other entitlement, remedy
or recourse, whether in law or equity. This _Section 9.7_ will not operate to
interfere with or impede the operation of the covenants contained in this
Agreement that by their nature are required to be performed after the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.8 _Right of Contribution_. If the Purchaser Indemnitee receives any
payment from Primary Seller Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
_Section 9.2_ and the Purchaser Indemnitee is entitled to recover all or a
part of such Damages from a Third Party (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based
on the underlying claim asserted against the Purchaser Indemnitee, the
Purchaser Indemnitee shall, to the extent permitted by Law and any applicable
Contract, assign such of its rights to recover such amounts against the
Potential Contributor to permit the Primary Seller Party to recover from the
Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

to any principles of conflicts of law. Without limiting any partys right to

shall have exclusive personal and subject matter jurisdiction and shall be the

Such court shall have sole jurisdiction over such matters and the parties
affected thereby and Purchasers and the Sellers each hereby consent and submit
to such jurisdiction; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the bankruptcy

or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The Sellers acknowledge that the Purchasers would be damaged irreparably
in the event that this Agreement is not performed by Sellers in accordance

fail to consummate the Closing as required hereunder and that, in addition to
any other remedy that the Purchasers may have under law or equity, the
Purchasers shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent breaches of

provisions hereof that are required to be performed by Sellers.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Purchasers acknowledge that Sellers would be damaged irreparably in

terms of this Agreement and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof that are required to be performed by the Purchasers.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Entire Agreement_. Except as set forth herein, this Agreement

prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral
or written, with respect thereto made by any Party.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Waiver_. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision (whether
or not similar) nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressed or provided. All waivers hereunder must be in writing to

Section 10.10 _Assignment_. Neither the Sellers nor the Purchasers may assign
or otherwise transfer their respective rights and/or obligations hereunder (or

Section 10.14 _Severability of Provisions_. Any provision of this Agreement
which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of this Agreement
or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement is
determined to be so broad as to be

 



      
 

 



 

unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable, provided in all cases that neither the economic nor legal
substance of this Agreement is affected by the operation of this sentence in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon any such determination that
any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable
substitute provision to effect the original intent of the Parties.

 



 

Section 10.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original hereof, and all of
which shall constitute a single agreement effective as of the date hereof. Any
delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile or

 _Exhibit B 
Form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement_

 



 

 **ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT**

 



 

THIS ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT, dated as of [*] (this " _Agreement_
"), is by and among [*], [*] and [*] (collectively, the " _Sellers_ ") and
[*], [*] and [*] (collectively, the " _Purchasers_ ").

 



 

WHEREAS, the Sellers and Purchasers have entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement, dated as of [*] (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "; unless otherwise
defined herein, capitalized terms shall be used herein as defined in the
Purchase Agreement);

 



 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Sellers have agreed to
assign, transfer, convey and deliver when due, any and all of the Purchased
Assets, including the Assumed Contracts and Assumed Leases (but not any of the
Excluded Assets);

 



 

WHEREAS, pursuant and subject to the Purchase Agreement, Purchasers have
agreed to assume, honor, pay and discharge when due, any and all of the
Assumed Liabilities (but not any of the Excluded Liabilities); and

 



 

WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Sellers and
Purchasers is a condition to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement;

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements and
covenants set forth in the Purchase Agreement and hereinafter set forth, the
Sellers and Purchasers hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **1.** **Assignment and Assumption of Liabilities.**

 



 

(a) The Sellers hereby assign, transfer, convey and deliver (i) all of the
Sellers right, title and interest in and to the Purchased Assets, including
the Assumed Contracts and Assumed Leases, to [*], pursuant and subject to the
Purchase Agreement and the Sale Order.

 



 

(b) [*] does hereby assume, and agree to honor, pay and discharge when due,
all of the Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of paragraph (b), [*] and [*] do
not assume, or agree to pay, perform or otherwise discharge when due, any
Liabilities of the Sellers other than the Assumed Liabilities, the Assumed
Contracts and Assumed Leases, including, without limitation, the Excluded
Liabilities.

 



 

 **2.** **Assignment of this Agreement.**

 



 

Neither the Sellers nor the Purchasers may assign or otherwise transfer their
respective rights and/or obligations hereunder (or agree to do so) without the
prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ , that Purchasers may,
without the consent of Sellers, assign

      
 

 



 

or transfer any or all of its right and/or obligations hereunder to one or
more of its Affiliates or other Persons (it being understood that Purchasers
nonetheless shall remain liable for the performance of all of Purchasers
obligations hereunder to the extent not performed by the assignee or any
Purchaser Designee). Any assignment or other transfer not permitted under this
section shall be null and void ab initio.

 



 

 **3.** **Further Assurances.**

 



 

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, each
of the Parties hereto agrees to execute, acknowledge, deliver, file and record
such further certificates, amendments, instruments and documents, and to do
all such other acts and things, as may be reasonably requested by any other
Party in order to carry out the intent and purpose of this Agreement at the
expense of the requesting Party, provided that this shall not require any
Party to take any action that is commercially unreasonable or that would
result in any Liability of such Party or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

 **4.** **No Third Party Beneficiaries.**

 



 

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or shall, confer any third party
beneficiary or other rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties
hereto.

 



 

 **5.** **Amendment.**

 



 

This Agreement may not be amended or modified except (a) by an instrument in
writing signed by, or on behalf of, the Sellers and Purchasers, or (b) by a
waiver pursuant to Section 6 below.

 



 

 **6.** **Waiver.**

 



 

Either party to this Agreement may (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party pursuant
hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the other party
or conditions to such partys obligations contained herein. Any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
by the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall
not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver
of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of
this Agreement. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights hereunder
shall not constitute a waiver of any such rights.

 



 

 **7.** **Severability.**

 



 

Any provision of this Agreement which is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
any of the provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any
provision of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be
unenforceable, such provision

      
 

 



 

shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, provided in all
cases that neither the economic nor legal substance of this Agreement is
affected by the operation of this sentence in any manner materially adverse to
any party. Upon any such determination that any provision of this Agreement is
invalid or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith in an
effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect
the original intent of the Parties.

 



 

 **8.** **Counterparts.**

 



 

This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed an original hereof, and all of which shall constitute a single
agreement effective as of the date hereof. Any delivery of an executed
counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile or electronic mail shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.** **Governing Law.**

 



 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with federal
bankruptcy law, to the extent applicable, and, where state law is implicated,
the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any
principles of conflicts of law. Without limiting any partys right to appeal
any order of the Bankruptcy Court, the parties agree that if any dispute
arises out of or in connection with this agreement or any of the documents
executed hereunder or in connection herewith, the Bankruptcy Court shall have

WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Bill of Sale by the Sellers is a

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual agreements set

the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Sellers do
hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **1.** **Sale and Assignment of the Purchased Assets.**

 



 

The Sellers hereby sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver unto [*] and its

 **2.** **Further Assurances.**

 



 

Subject to the provisions of this Bill of Sale and the Purchase Agreement,
each of the Parties hereto agrees to execute, acknowledge, deliver, file and
record such further certificates, amendments, instruments and documents, and
to do all such other acts and things, as may be reasonably requested by any
other Party in order to carry out the intent and purpose of the Bill of Sale

Any provision of this Bill of Sale which is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or

agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the
original intent of the Parties.

This Bill of Sale may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original hereof, and all of which shall constitute a single
agreement effective as of the date hereof. Any delivery of an executed

federal bankruptcy law, to the extent applicable, and, where state law is
implicated, the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect

resolution of any such claim or dispute. The parties hereby irrevocably waive,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought
in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such
dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law. In the event any such action, suit or proceeding is

 _EXHIBIT H 
Terms of IP License Agreement_

 



 

" _Wanxiang Sub_ " means the subsidiary of any Purchaser that owns the
Background Technology as of the Closing Date.

 



 

* The Wanxiang Sub will license to A123 and its permitted successor in interest to the USG Business ("Licensee") all Background Technology that exists as of the Closing Date for the sole purpose of exploitation in the USG Business. " _Background Technology_ " means the Purchased IP that exists as of the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, no improvements or developments by Purchaser or its Affiliates in the Background Technology after the Closing will be licensed to Licensee under the IP License Agreement.

 



 

* The license described above will be nonexclusive, irrevocable, fully paid-up, worldwide, and royalty-free, except that, to the extent that any Background Technology licensed to Licensee under the IP License Agreement is subject to royalty payments to a third party or maintenance costs borne by Wanxiang Sub or its Affiliates, then Licensee shall pay (on its own behalf and on behalf of its sublicensees) to Wanxiang Sub (i) a royalty fee equal to a proportionate share of any royalty fees payable by Wanxiang Sub and its Affiliates and (ii) a proportionate share of the maintenance costs borne by Wanxiang Sub and its Affiliates, as applicable, provided, that, in each case of clause (i) and (ii), such proportions shall be based on Licensees and its sublicensees relative use of such Background Technology.

 



 

* The initial term of the license shall be three years; provided, however, that upon Licensees request the Wanxiang Sub will negotiate in good faith an extension of the license for an additional seven years (or such shorter period as Licensee may request) at a commercially reasonable royalty rate.

 



 

* Licensee will have full rights to sublicense for the sole purpose of exploitation in the USG Business by Licensee.

 



 

* The license will be nontransferable, except that A123 shall have the right to transfer such license (once and only once) to a third party who is the successor in interest to the USG Business solely for the purpose of such business, in which case A123 shall cease to hold any right to such license. Any third-party transferee shall have the right to subsequently transfer such license with the prior written consent of the Wanxiang Sub, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

* The license to Licensee may be subject to such conditions as may be deemed necessary to protect any national security concerns related to the USG Business.

      
 

 



 

* Licensee shall agree not to bring any claim, suit, or proceeding against Wanxiang Sub or its Affiliates or any of their contractors or customers after the Closing Date alleging infringement or misappropriation of the Excluded IP or of Licensees Intellectual Property Rights in any improvements or modifications to, or developments based on, the Background Technology.
