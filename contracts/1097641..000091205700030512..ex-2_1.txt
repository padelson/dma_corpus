                           FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED
                AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

    THIS FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND
REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is made as of May 9, 2000 by and among
724 SOLUTIONS INC., a corporation amalgamated under the laws of Ontario
("724 Solutions"), SAPPHIRE MERGER SUB, INC., a California corporation ("Merger
Sub"), EZLOGIN.COM, INC., a California corporation ("Ezlogin"), and Alexandre
Balkanski, as Shareholders' Agent. As used in this Agreement, certain terms
shall have the meanings set forth in Annex I.

                                    RECITALS

    A.  The parties hereto have entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of
Merger and Reorganization (the "Original Merger Agreement"), dated as of
March 30, 2000, which provided for the Merger (as defined below) and the
exercise (whether or not then vested) or termination at the Effective Time of
all Ezlogin Options.

    B.  The parties hereto desire to amend and restate the Original Merger
Agreement as set forth herein to allow the assumption by 724 Solutions of the
Ezlogin Stock Option Plan, subject to confirmation that no shareholder vote of
724 Solutions is required in connection with such assumption.

    C.  The Boards of Directors of 724 Solutions, Merger Sub and Ezlogin each
have determined that the acquisition of Ezlogin by 724 Solutions through the
merger of Merger Sub with and into Ezlogin pursuant to the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein (the "Merger") is in the best interests of their
respective companies and shareholders.

    D.  Merger Sub is a wholly-owned subsidiary of 724 Solutions.

    E.  Pursuant to the Merger, each outstanding share of capital stock of
Ezlogin ("Ezlogin Capital Stock") shall be converted into common shares of
724 Solutions, at the rate set forth herein.

    F.  Ezlogin and 724 Solutions desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and other agreements in connection with the Merger.

    G.  The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), and to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code.

    H.  As an inducement to 724 Solutions to enter into the Original Merger
Agreement, the officers and directors and certain Shareholders previously
entered into the Voting Agreement to vote the shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock
owned by such persons to approve the Merger, each Shareholder who entered into
the Voting Agreement also entered into a Holders' Agreement, the Key Employees
of Ezlogin entered into Employment and Non-Competition Agreements with Ezlogin
and certain Other Employees entered into Employment Agreements with Ezlogin. As
an inducement to 724 Solutions to enter into this Agreement, each Shareholder
who entered into an Employee Shareholders' Agreement has entered into an
Employee Holders' Agreement, which Employee Holders' Agreement amends and
restates in its entirety the Employee Shareholders' Agreement previously entered
into by such Shareholder.

    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and representations set
forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

and Article VIII.

    (b) CANCELLATION OF EZLOGIN CAPITAL STOCK OWNED BY EZLOGIN.  At the

    (c) EXERCISE OR TERMINATION, OR ASSUMPTION, OF EZLOGIN OPTIONS; CONVERSION

subject to Section 5.2 hereof, at the Effective Time, the Ezlogin 1999 Stock
Option Plan (the "Ezlogin Stock Option Plan") shall:

         (i) if, prior to the Closing Date, 724 Solutions shall have received
    written confirmation from the Nasdaq National Market, reasonably
    satisfactory to 724 Solutions and Ezlogin, that no shareholder vote will be
    required in connection with such assumption, and such confirmation shall not
    have been rescinded (the "Nasdaq Confirmation"), be assumed by
    724 Solutions in accordance with Section 5.9; or

        (ii) if, prior to the Closing Date, 724 Solutions shall not have
    received the Nasdaq Confirmation, be terminated, and each option agreement
    covering all Ezlogin Options then outstanding under the Ezlogin Stock Option
    Plan shall be amended in accordance with Section 5.9(c)(ii), and all such

Section 5.21.

    (d) ADJUSTMENTS TO EXCHANGE RATIO.  The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to

724 Solutions Common Stock or Ezlogin Capital Stock occurring after March 30,

    (e) FRACTIONAL SHARES.  No fraction of a share of 724 Solutions Common Stock
will be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Ezlogin Capital
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of 724 Solutions
Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of 724 Solutions Common
Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from 724 Solutions an amount
of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such
fraction, multiplied by (ii) the 724 Solutions Stock Price, less any amount
required to be withheld under foreign, federal, state or local tax laws.

    (f) DISSENTERS' RIGHTS.  Any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into
the right to receive 724 Solutions Common Stock but shall instead be converted
into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to California Law. Ezlogin agrees
that, except with the prior written consent of 724 Solutions, or as required
under California Law, it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demand. Each holder of Dissenting Shares
("Dissenting Shareholder") who, pursuant to the provisions of California Law,
becomes entitled to payment of the fair value for shares of Ezlogin Capital
Stock shall receive payment therefor (but only after the value therefor shall
have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions of
California law). If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose
their status as Dissenting Shares, 724 Solutions shall issue and deliver, upon
surrender by such Shareholder of certificate or certificates representing shares
of Ezlogin Capital Stock, the number of shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock to
which such Shareholder would otherwise be entitled under this Section 1.6 and
the Agreement of Merger less the number of shares allocable to such Shareholder
that have been deposited in the Escrow Fund (as defined below) in respect of
such shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.7(d) and
Article VIII hereof.

Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued,

Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares
shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

    1.7 SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES.

    (a) EXCHANGE AGENT.  724 Solutions' transfer agent shall act as exchange
agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.

    (b) 724 SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDE COMMON STOCK AND CASH.  Promptly after the
Effective Time, 724 Solutions shall make available to the Exchange Agent for
exchange in accordance with this Article I, through such reasonable procedures
as 724 Solutions may adopt, (i) the shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) (provided that delivery of any shares that
are subject to vesting shall be in book entry form only until such vesting
restrictions have lapsed, following which time such shares shall be delivered
promptly to the holder thereof) in exchange for shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (less the number of shares
of 724 Solutions Common Stock to be deposited into an escrow fund (the "Escrow
Fund") pursuant to the requirements of Article VIII), and (ii) cash in an amount
sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.6(e), less any amount required to be withheld from such cash under
foreign, federal, state or local tax laws.

    (c) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.  Subject to Section 1.6(f), promptly after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Ezlogin Capital Stock, whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares)
pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only upon receipt of the Certificates by the Exchange Agent, and shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as 724 Solutions may reasonably
specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates (or book entries in the case of
Unvested Shares and the Shareholders shall not call for certificates to be
issued for such Unvested Shares) representing shares of 724 Solutions Common
Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares). Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may
be appointed by 724 Solutions, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate (or a book entry in the case of Unvested Shares and the Shareholders
shall not call for certificates to be issued for such Unvested Shares)
representing the number of whole shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock (less the
number of shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock to be deposited in the Escrow
Fund on such holder's behalf pursuant to Article VIII hereof) and payment in
lieu of fractional shares (less any amount required to be withheld from such
cash under foreign, federal, state or local tax laws) that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate
that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock
will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes to
evidence the ownership of the number of full shares of 724 Solutions Common
Stock into which such shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock shall have been so
converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of
any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6.

    (d) ESCROW SHARES AND SUBJECT OPTIONS.

        (i) As security for the Holders' indemnity obligations as set forth in
    Article VIII, (i) ten percent (10%) of the shares of 724 Solutions Common
    Stock issued in the Merger in respect of Ezlogin Capital

                                       4
<PAGE>
    Stock outstanding at the Effective Time (the "Escrow Shares") shall be
    subject to the escrow described below, and (ii) if 724 Solutions assumes the
    Ezlogin Stock Option Plan in connection with the Merger, ten percent (10%)
    of the Assumed Options (the "Subject Options") shall be subject to
    cancellation as provided below. The Escrow Shares, along with the Subject
    Options, shall be available to compensate 724 Solutions for certain damages
    as provided in Article VIII; provided, to the extent not used to compensate
    724 Solutions for such damages, the Escrow Shares and Subject Options shall
    be released, all as provided in Article VIII hereof and the Escrow
    Agreement.

        (ii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and
    subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII hereof,
    724 Solutions shall distribute to the Escrow Agent a certificate or
    certificates representing the Escrow Shares. The Escrow Shares shall be
    registered in the name of the Escrow Agent, as nominee for the holders of
    Certificates cancelled pursuant to this Section 1.7. The Escrow Shares shall
    be withheld on a pro rata basis from the shares of 724 Solutions Common
    Stock issuable in respect of each share of Ezlogin Capital Stock pursuant to
    Section 1.6 hereof.

       (iii) If applicable, the Assumed Options that will be Subject Options
    will be determined on a pro rata basis amongst the Optionholders, and shall
    consist of ten percent (10%) of all Assumed Options resulting from the
    assumption of Ezlogin Options that were vested as of the Closing Date and
    ten percent (10%) of all Assumed Options vesting on each vesting date
    thereafter (whether or not such vesting would occur prior to or after the
    termination of the Escrow Period). The shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock
    that will be Escrow Shares will be determined on a pro rata basis amongst
    the Holders, and shall consist of ten percent (10%) of all shares of
    724 Solutions Common Stock not subject to an Unvested Share Repurchase
    Option as of the Closing Date, and, if applicable, ten percent (10%) of all
    shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock for which the Unvested Share Repurchase
    Option will lapse on each lapsing date thereafter (whether or not such
    lapsing would occur prior to or after the termination of the Escrow Period).

        (iv) If any Subject Option is exercised prior to the termination of the
    Escrow Period (or after the Escrow Period, if such Subject Option has been
    subject to cancellation to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any
    Officers' Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Shareholders'
    Agent prior to the termination of the Escrow Period with respect to facts
    and circumstances existing prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period and
    until such claims have been resolved), the resulting shares of
    724 Solutions Common Stock (the "Subject Shares") shall be delivered to the
    Escrow Fund in the name of the Escrow Agent as nominee for the Holder and
    shall be treated as Escrow Shares hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement.
    As soon as reasonably possible after any delivery of Subject Shares to the
    Escrow Agent, 724 Solutions and the Shareholders' Agent will deliver to the
    Escrow Agent a new Schedule 1 to the Escrow Agreement, reflecting the
    additional Subject Shares and the change in each Holder's pro rata portion
    of the Escrow Fund.

    (e) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES.  No dividends or other
distributions with respect to 724 Solutions Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock represented
thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of any
such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore payable (but for the provisions of this Section 1.7(e)) with
respect to such shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock.

    (f) TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP.  If any certificate for shares of 724 Solutions
Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to 724 Solutions or any agent designated by it any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for
shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or established to the
reasonable satisfaction of 724 Solutions or any agent designated by it that such
tax has been paid or is not payable.

                                       5
<PAGE>
    (g) NO LIABILITY.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party
hereto shall be liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

    (h) DISSENTING SHARES.  The provisions of this Section 1.7 shall also apply
to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the obligations
of 724 Solutions under this Section 1.7 shall commence on the date of loss of
such status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange for such shares the number of shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 1.6 hereof, subject to the provision for Escrow Shares in
Section 1.7(d) and Article VIII.

    1.8 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN EZLOGIN CAPITAL STOCK.  All shares of
724 Solutions Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of
Ezlogin Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any Escrow
Shares and any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Ezlogin Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

    1.9 LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES.  In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of 724 Solutions
Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) as may be required pursuant
to Section 1.6; provided, however, that 724 Solutions may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
724 Solutions, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

    1.10 TAX AND ACCOUNTING CONSEQUENCES.  The parties intend that the Merger
shall (a) constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code and (b) qualify for accounting treatment as a purchase transaction under
U.S. GAAP.

    1.11 FAIRNESS HEARING AND EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION; LEGENDS.

    (a) As provided in, and subject to, Section 5.1 hereof, 724 Solutions
intends to apply for a permit to be issued by the California Commissioner of
Corporations after a public hearing on the fairness of the terms and conditions
of the Merger (the "Fairness Hearing") in order to issue the shares of
724 Solutions Common Stock to the Ezlogin Shareholders pursuant to an exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act") provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof (the "3(a)(10)
Exemption"). In the event 724 Solutions shall not have received a favorable
determination in the Fairness Hearing and a Permit covering all of the shares of
724 Solutions Common Stock to be issued in the Merger such that the issuance
qualifies for exemption under the 3(a)(10) Exemption, the 724 Solutions Common
Stock shall, provided such exemption is available for the shares of
724 Solutions Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, be issued in a private
placement as "restricted securities" as defined under Rule 144 of the Securities
Act and will be subject to the following legend, which legend is subject to
approval by The Toronto Stock Exchange:

    THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT
    AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED
    (THE "SECURITIES ACT"). THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED,
    ASSIGNED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS (A) THERE IS AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
    STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT COVERING SUCH SECURITIES, OR (B) A VALID EXEMPTION
    THEREFROM AND THE COMPANY RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE HOLDER OF
    THESE SECURITIES REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, STATING THAT SUCH
    SALE, TRANSFER, ASSIGNMENT OR HYPOTHECATION IS EXEMPT FROM THE REGISTRATION
    AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT.

                                       6
<PAGE>
    724 Solutions agrees that it will not unreasonably require an opinion of
counsel for any transfer made pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The
legend set forth above shall be removed from the certificate representing shares
of 724 Solutions Common Stock at the request of the holder thereof at such time
as they become eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities
Act, which request shall be accompanied by the favorable opinion of legal
counsel, reasonably satisfactory to 724 Solutions, concerning compliance with
the conditions of Rule 144(k).

    (b) Regardless of whether 724 Solutions receives a favorable determination
in the Fairness Hearing, the shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock to be issued
in connection with the Merger will be subject to the following legend, which
legend is subject to approval by The Toronto Stock Exchange:

           THE SHARES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF
       [AN EMPLOYEE HOLDERS' AGREEMENT] [A NON-EMPLOYEE SHAREHOLDERS'
       AGREEMENT], DATED             , 2000, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED
       FROM THE COMPANY.

    The legend set forth above shall be removed from the certificate
representing shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock at the request of the holder
thereof at such time as the restrictions set forth in the applicable Holders'
Agreement expire.

    (c) In addition, 724 Solutions may place on the certificates representing
shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock issued in the Merger other appropriate
legends pursuant to applicable law.

    1.12 TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION.  If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Ezlogin, the officers and directors of Ezlogin and the
Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of their respective
corporation or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary
action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE II
                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF EZLOGIN

    Except as disclosed in a document dated March 30, 2000 attached as a
schedule to the Original Agreement and delivered by Ezlogin to 724 Solutions
prior to the execution and delivery of the Original Agreement, the parts of
which are numbered according to the relevant sections of this Agreement, as
updated in a document of even date herewith attached as a schedule to this
Agreement, the paragraphs of which are numbered according to the sections of the
original document being updated (as so updated, the "Ezlogin Disclosure
Schedule"), Ezlogin represents and warrants to 724 Solutions as follows:

    2.1 ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER.

    (a) Ezlogin is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of California. Ezlogin has the corporate power to own
its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as
currently proposed by Ezlogin to be conducted and is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure to be
so qualified and in good standing would have a Material Adverse Effect. Ezlogin
has delivered a true and correct copy of the Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws of Ezlogin, each as amended to March 30, 2000, to 724 Solutions. Ezlogin
is not in violation of any of the provisions of its Articles of Incorporation or
Bylaws, as both are amended through March 30, 2000.

    (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.1 to the Ezlogin Disclosure Schedule,
Ezlogin currently does not, directly or indirectly, own any equity or similar
interest in, or any interest convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for, any
equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or
other business association or entity, nor has Ezlogin ever, directly or
indirectly, owned such interests.

    (c) Ezlogin is not conducting, and has never conducted, its business or any
of its operations under any names other than Ezlogin.com, Inc. or ePorter, Inc.
or substantially similar variations thereof.

    2.2 CAPITAL STRUCTURE.

    (a) The authorized capital stock of Ezlogin consists of (i) 25,000,000
shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Ezlogin Common Stock"), and
(ii) 9,100,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which

correct list of Ezlogin's Shareholders, Optionholders and any persons with
rights to acquire Ezlogin securities (showing the name of each holder, they type

vesting and other restrictions applicable to each such right), including,
without limitation, any rights to acquire Ezlogin securities held by employees,
consultants or other third parties, as compensation for services rendered, upon
the achievement of predetermined goals, upon termination of agreements between
Ezlogin and such persons, or for any other reason ("Bonus Shares"), which list
will be updated prior to Closing to reflect any changes thereto (which changes
are in any event subject to the restrictions imposed under Section 4.2 below).
All outstanding shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable, are free of any liens or encumbrances

Ezlogin has also made available to 724 Solutions the most recent Internal

defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, (other than an
exempt prohibited transaction under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code or one for which an administrative class exemption is available) with
respect to any Ezlogin Employee Plan, that could reasonably be expected to have,
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Ezlogin; (iii) each Ezlogin
Employee Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms and in
compliance with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules and
regulations (including ERISA and the Code and any comparable foreign statutes,

Adverse Effect on Ezlogin, and Ezlogin or ERISA Affiliate have performed all

contributions to each Ezlogin Employee Plan, in accordance with Ezlogin's
ordinary accounting and business practices, for the current plan years and any
previous plan years as to which all contributions have not yet been made;

prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite governmental reports,
including any such reports required to be filed in connection with any
applicable foreign laws (which were true and correct as of the date filed) and
has properly and timely filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports

the best Knowledge of Ezlogin is threatened, against or with respect to any such
Ezlogin Employee Plan, including any audit or other material written or oral
inquiry by the IRS or United States Department of Labor, or an audit or other

Effect on Ezlogin, (ii) the applicable requirements of the Family Medical and
Leave Act of 1993 and the regulations thereunder, except to the extent that such
failure to comply would not, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Ezlogin, and (iii) the applicable requirements of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations (including
proposed regulations) thereunder, except to the extent that such failure to
comply would not, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Ezlogin,
and (iv) in each instance above, any comparable foreign laws which are
applicable to the Ezlogin Employee Plans.

    (e) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by Ezlogin, any ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change
in participation or coverage under, any Ezlogin Employee Plan that would
materially increase the expense of maintaining such Plan above the level of
expense incurred with respect to that Plan for the most recent fiscal year
included in Ezlogin's financial statements.

    (f) Ezlogin does not currently maintain, sponsor, participate in or
contribute to, nor has it ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated
in, or contributed to, any pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA) that is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

threatened with any liability (whether joint or several) (i) for any excise tax
imposed by Sections 4971, 4975, 4976, 4977 or 4979 of the Code, or (ii) to a
fine under Section 502 of ERISA.

    (i) Ezlogin has duly fulfilled on a timely basis all its affiliation,
payment and reporting obligations under applicable French social security laws
and regulations, and under any voluntary French complementary health,
unemployment or retirement insurance plans (copies of which have been made

employees.

    2.15 CERTAIN AGREEMENTS AFFECTED BY THE MERGER.  Except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise set forth on Schedule 2.15,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any payment (including,
without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute,
bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any director, officer, agent or employee of
Ezlogin or any other third party, (ii) materially increase any benefits
otherwise payable by Ezlogin, or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment or vesting of any such benefits except as required under Code
Section 411(d)(3).

    2.16 EMPLOYEE MATTERS.  Ezlogin is in compliance in all material respects
with all currently applicable laws and regulations respecting employment,
discrimination in employment, terms and conditions of employment, wages, hours
and occupational safety and health and employment practices, and is not engaged
in any unfair

                                       15

labor practice. Ezlogin has withheld all amounts required by law or by agreement
to be withheld from the wages, salaries, and other payments to employees; and is
not liable for any arrears of wages or any taxes or any penalty for failure to
comply with any of the foregoing. Ezlogin is not liable for any payment to any
trust or other fund or to any governmental or administrative authority, with
respect to unemployment compensation benefits, social security or other benefits
or obligations for employees (other than routine payments to be made in the
normal course of business and consistent with past practice). There are no
pending claims against Ezlogin under any workers compensation plan or policy or
for long term disability. There are no controversies pending or, to the
Knowledge of Ezlogin, threatened, between Ezlogin and any of its employees,
which controversies have or could reasonably be expected to result in an action,
suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation before any agency, court
or tribunal, foreign or domestic. Ezlogin is not a party to any collective
bargaining agreement or other labor unions contract nor does Ezlogin know of any
activities or proceedings of any labor union or organize any such employees. To
Ezlogin's Knowledge, no employees of Ezlogin are in violation of any term of any
employment contract, patent disclosure agreement, enforceable noncompetition or
nonsolicitation agreement, or any enforceable restrictive covenant to a former
employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by Ezlogin
because of the nature of the business conducted or presently proposed to be
conducted by Ezlogin or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information
of others. As of the date of the Original Merger Agreement, no employees of
Ezlogin have given notice to Ezlogin, nor is Ezlogin otherwise aware, that any
such employee intends to terminate his or her employment with Ezlogin. To the
Knowledge of Ezlogin, except as disclosed on Schedule 2.16, all employees of
Ezlogin, to the extent applicable, have duly issued and valid visas permitting
such employees to fully render such services and perform such duties and
obligations as presently, or presently contemplated to be, rendered or performed
by such employee for Ezlogin and such visas will be in full force and effect as
of the Effective Time and will not be adversely affected by the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

    2.17 INTERESTED PARTY TRANSACTIONS.  Ezlogin is not indebted to any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents (except for amounts due as normal
salaries and bonuses and in reimbursement of ordinary expenses), and no such
person is indebted to either Ezlogin, except, if applicable, for loans by
Ezlogin to employees, consultants or directors to exercise Ezlogin Options in
connection with this Agreement, pursuant to Section 5.9.

    2.18 INSURANCE.  Ezlogin has policies of insurance and bonds of the type and
in amounts customarily carried by persons conducting businesses or owning assets
similar to those of Ezlogin at a comparable stage of development. There is no
material claim pending under any of such policies or bonds as to which coverage
has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies or
bonds. All premiums due and payable under all such policies and bonds have been
paid and Ezlogin is otherwise in compliance with the terms of such policies and
bonds. Ezlogin has no Knowledge of any threatened termination of, or material
premium increase with respect to, any of such policies.

    2.19 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.  Ezlogin has complied with, is not in violation
of, and has not received any notices of violation with respect to, any federal,
state, local or foreign statute, law or regulation with respect to the conduct
of its business, or the ownership or operation of its business, except for such
violations or failures to comply as could not be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Ezlogin.

    2.20 MINUTE BOOKS.  All minute books of Ezlogin have been made available to
724 Solutions and the minute books contain a complete and accurate summary of
all meetings of its directors and shareholders or actions by written consent
since the time of incorporation of Ezlogin through the date of the Original
Merger Agreement, and reflect all transactions referred to in such minutes
accurately in all material respects. There are no material actions taken by

party to or bound by any material contract, including without limitation:

        (a) any distributor, sales, agency or manufacturer's representative

    equipment or services involving in the case of any such contact more than
    $50,000 over the life of the contract;

    of business or to compete with any other Person as that term is defined in
    the Exchange Act, as defined herein;

                                       17

    2.30 NO BREACH OF MATERIAL CONTRACTS.  All Material Contracts are in written
form. Ezlogin has performed all of the obligations required to be performed by
it and is entitled to all benefits under, and is not alleged to be in default in
respect of any Material Contract. Each of the Material Contracts is in full
force and effect, in all material respects, and, except as disclosed on
Schedule 2.29, unamended, and there exists no default or event of default or
event, occurrence, condition or act, with respect to Ezlogin or to Ezlogin's
Knowledge with respect to the other contracting party, which, with the giving of
notice, the lapse of the time or the happening of any other event or conditions,
would become a default or event of default under any Material Contract. True,
correct and complete copies of all Material Contracts have been delivered to
724 Solutions.

    2.31 MATERIAL THIRD PARTY CONSENTS.  Schedule 2.31 lists all contracts that
require a novation, or consent to the Merger or change of control, as the case
may be, prior to the Effective Time so that such contracts may remain in full
force and effect after the Closing and sets forth every contract requiring
novation or consent to change of control that, if no novation occurs or if no
consent to the Merger or change of control is obtained, would have a Material
Adverse Effect on 724 Solutions' ability to operate the business in the same
manner as the business was operated by Ezlogin prior to the Effective Time.

    2.32 REAL PROPERTY.

    (a) Ezlogin has never owned any real property.

    (b) Schedule 2.32(b) sets forth a list of all leases, licenses or similar
agreements to which Ezlogin is a party, that are for the use or occupancy of
real estate owned by a third party ("Leases") (copies of which have previously
been furnished to 724 Solutions), in each case, setting forth: (i) the lessor
and lessee thereof and the commencement date, term and renewal rights under each
of the Leases, and (ii) the street address or legal description of each property
covered thereby (the "Leased Premises"). The Leases are in full force and effect
in all material respects and have not been amended except as disclosed in
Schedule 2.32(b), and no party thereto is in default or breach under any such
Lease. No event has occurred that, with the passage of time or the giving of
notice or both, would cause a breach of or default under any of such Leases.
Ezlogin has valid leasehold interests in each of the Leased Premises, which
leasehold interest is free and clear of any liens, covenants and easements or
title defects of any nature whatsoever other than Permitted Liens.

    (c) With respect to the Leased Premises, (i) there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of Ezlogin, threatened condemnation proceedings, suits or
administrative actions relating to any such parcel or other matters affecting
adversely the current use, occupancy or value thereof, (ii) all improvements,
buildings and systems on any such parcel are in good repair and safe for their
current occupancy and use, (iii) there are no contracts or agreements (whether
oral or written) granting to any party or parties the right of use or occupancy
of any such parcel, and there are no parties (other than Ezlogin) in possession
of any such parcel; (iv) there are no outstanding options or rights of first
refusal or similar rights to purchase any such parcel or any portion thereof or
interest therein, (v) all facilities located on each such parcel are supplied
with utilities and other services necessary for their ownership, operation or
use, currently or as currently proposed by Ezlogin, all of which services are
adequate in accordance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations, and (vi) each such parcel abuts on and has adequate direct
vehicular access to a public road and there is no pending or, to the Knowledge
of Ezlogin, threatened termination of such access.

    2.33 PRODUCT RELEASES.  Ezlogin has provided 724 Solutions a Schedule of
Product Releases of Ezlogin, which Schedule is attached hereto as
Schedule 2.33. Ezlogin has a good faith reasonable belief that it can achieve
the release of products on the schedule described in Schedule 2.33 and is not
currently aware of any change in its circumstances or other fact that has
occurred that would cause it to believe that it will be unable to meet such
release schedule.

    2.34 YEAR 2000.  None of the products and services sold, licensed, rendered,
or otherwise provided by Ezlogin in the conduct of its businesses have
malfunctioned, ceased to function, generated materially incorrect data or
produced materially incorrect results (nor has Ezlogin received any notice or
other communication regarding such a malfunction) when processing, providing or
receiving (i) date-related data from, into and between the Twentieth (20th) and
Twenty-First (21st) centuries, or (ii) date-related data in connection with any
valid date in the Twentieth (20th) and Twenty-First (21st) centuries causing a
Material Adverse Effect on Ezlogin.

    2.35 HEARING DOCUMENTS; RULE 506 DOCUMENTS.  The information relating to
Ezlogin included in the Hearing Documents and the Rule 506 Documents, if
applicable, shall not, at the time the Hearing Documents, and the Rule 506
Documents, if applicable, are mailed to Shareholders of Ezlogin and at all times
subsequent thereto (through and including the Effective Date), contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

    2.36 WAIVER OF RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL.  Intuit, Inc. has executed and
delivered an enforceable waiver of its right of first refusal pursuant to
Section 5 of the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated October 8, 1999,
and a copy of such waiver has been delivered to 724 Solutions.

    2.37 ASSETS AND REVENUES.  Ezlogin is its own "ultimate parent entity" as
such term is defined in 16 C.F.R. Section 801.1(a)(3). Ezlogin, on a
consolidated basis, does not (i) have assets having an aggregate book value of
$10 million or more based on its most recent regularly prepared balance sheet or
(ii) sales of $10 million or more in its most recent fiscal year.

    2.38 EZLOGIN TRANSACTION EXPENSES.  Ezlogin's legal, accounting and
investment banking fees and expenses, and all other fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the Merger ("Ezlogin Transaction Expenses"), shall not exceed
$400,000. If the Ezlogin Transaction Expenses are in excess of $400,000, such
excess shall be considered a 724 Solutions Damage that is not subject to the
Indemnification Threshold or Indemnification Cap pursuant to Section 8.2.

    2.39 REPRESENTATIONS COMPLETE.  None of the representations or warranties
made by Ezlogin herein or in any Schedule hereto, including the Ezlogin
Disclosure Schedule, or certificate furnished by Ezlogin pursuant to this
Agreement, when all such documents are read together in their entirety, contains

                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

    5.1 REGISTRATION EXEMPTION; FAIRNESS HEARING.

    (a) Ezlogin shall cooperate with 724 Solutions with respect to any
qualification for exemption from registration under federal securities laws, or
for qualification or exemption under state securities or "blue sky" laws,
pursued by 724 Solutions with respect to the shares of 724 Solutions Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Ezlogin shall:

    promptly provide to 724 Solutions all pertinent information concerning
    Ezlogin, its capital stock and the Shareholders and Optionholders;

    promptly review and comment on any documents or drafts supplied by 724
    Solutions;

    promptly take all other actions as 724 Solutions may reasonably request; and

    promptly inform 724 Solutions, at any time prior to the Effective Time, of
    any event or information discovered by Ezlogin that should be set forth in
    an amendment to the Hearing Documents.

    (b) The information provided by Ezlogin and 724 Solutions shall not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Whenever
Ezlogin obtains any Knowledge of any event that causes any of such information
provided by Ezlogin to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, Ezlogin shall promptly inform 724 Solutions. Ezlogin shall
promptly inform 724 Solutions if it obtains any Knowledge of any event or
occurrence that should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to any
application or other documents relating to the exemption from registration, and
will cooperate in mailing to the Shareholders and Optionholders such amendments
or supplements as may be appropriate.

    (c) All parties hereto acknowledge that 724 Solutions intends to apply to
the California Commissioner of Corporations for a permit (the "Permit"), which
may only be issued after a public hearing on the fairness of the terms and
conditions of the Merger (the "Fairness Hearing"), in order to be eligible to
issue 724 Solutions Common Stock to the Shareholders of Ezlogin pursuant to an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, provided by
Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of the Original Merger Agreement, 724 Solutions, with the
full cooperation and assistance of Ezlogin, shall prepare and file with the
California Department of Corporations an Application for Qualification of
Securities by Permit under Section 25121 of the California Corporate Securities
Law of 1968, as amended, and related materials required to be filed in
connection with such Application (collectively, the "Hearing Documents"). 724
Solutions and Ezlogin will thereafter endeavor in good faith to obtain a finding
of fairness and the issuance of a Permit to such effect by the California
Department of Corporations as a result of such hearing, but they shall in no
event be required to alter the terms of the Merger or this Agreement in order to

                                       25
<PAGE>
obtain such finding and issuance. All parties hereto shall proceed expeditiously
and cooperate fully in making available all information necessary to complete
the Permit application and to participate as may be necessary or appropriate at
the Fairness Hearing.

    (d) In the event 724 Solutions shall not have received a favorable
determination in the Fairness Hearing and a Permit covering all of the shares of
724 Solutions Common Stock to be issued in the Merger such that the issuance
qualifies for exemption under the 3(a)(10) Exemption, the Closing of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will take place as
provided in Section 1.2 hereof, provided that the shares of 724 Solutions Common
Stock to be issued to the Ezlogin Shareholders hereunder shall, provided such
exemption is available for the shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock issued in
the Merger, be issued in a private placement as "restricted securities" as
defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, and the parties shall comply with
Section 5.20 hereof.

    5.2 TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND HOLDERS' AGREEMENTS.

    (a) EMPLOYEE RESTRICTIONS.  Each share of 724 Solutions Common Stock issued
at the Closing or upon the exercise of an Assumed Option, to any Holder, other
than a Non-Employee Shareholder (each, an "Employee Holder"), shall be subject
to the transfer restrictions described, and all other provisions set forth, in
the form of the Employee Holders' Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit C-1 (the
"Employee Holders' Agreement"), as if all such restrictions and provisions were
set forth in full in the body of this Agreement, whether or not an Employee
Holder executes and delivers an Employee Holders' Agreement.

    (b) NON-EMPLOYEE RESTRICTIONS.  Each share of 724 Solutions Common Stock
issued at the Closing to a Shareholder listed on Schedule 5.2(b) hereof (each, a
"Non-Employee Shareholder") shall be subject to the transfer restrictions
described, and all other provisions set forth, in the form of Non-Employee
Shareholders' Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit C-2 (the "Non-Employee
Shareholders' Agreement"), as if all such restrictions and provisions were set
forth in full in the body of this Agreement, whether or not a Non-Employee
Shareholder executes and delivers a Non-Employee Shareholders' Agreement.

    (c) REPURCHASE OF UNVESTED SHARES.  If 724 Solutions does not assume the
Assumed Options in connection with the Merger, each share of 724 Solutions
Common Stock issued at the Closing to an Employee Holder in exchange for an
Unvested Share shall be subject to the Unvested Share Repurchase Option, in
favor of 724 Solutions, described and set forth in the Employee Holder Agreement
(the "Unvested Share Repurchase Option") as if all of such Unvested Share
Repurchase Option was set forth in full in the body of this Agreement, whether
or not an Employee Holder executes and delivers an Employee Holder Agreement.
For purposes of the foregoing, "Unvested Share" shall mean any shares of Ezlogin
Capital Stock issued upon the early exercise of an Ezlogin Option as
contemplated by Section 5.9 hereof, or that were subject to a right of
repurchase by Ezlogin immediately prior to the Closing.

    (d) EXECUTION OF HOLDERS' AGREEMENTS.  Ezlogin will use its best efforts to
cause each Holder to execute and deliver to 724 Solutions an Employee Holders'
Agreement or a Non-Employee Shareholders' Agreement (including the delivery of
all documents requested therein), as the case may be, on or prior to the Closing
Date. Any such Employee Holders' Agreement or a Non-Employee Shareholders'
Agreement (collectively, the "Holders' Agreements") which will disclose any
liens or other encumbrances on such Holder's shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock
shall be delivered to 724 Solutions no later than ten (10) business days prior
to the Closing Date.

    (e) COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
no Shareholder or Optionholder may transfer any shares of 724 Solutions Common
Stock other than in compliance with all applicable federal, state and foreign
securities laws, including any laws relating to registration or qualification or
the qualification for exemption therefrom, and, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, all "Affiliates" of Ezlogin may not transfer the 724 Solutions
Common Stock issued to Shareholders in the Merger or to any Optionholder upon
the exercise of any Assumed Options, unless such transfer is made in conformity
with the requirements of Rule 145(d) promulgated under the Securities Act.

    (f) CANADIAN SECURITIES LAWS; EXEMPTION.  724 Solutions will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and will provide such evidence as is
reasonably available and reasonably requested by Ezlogin of, all necessary
rulings or orders of Canadian securities regulatory authorities exempting the
distribution by 724 Solutions of the 724 Solutions Common Stock and options to
purchase 724 Solutions Common Stock

                                       26
<PAGE>
pursuant to the Merger, and the resale of such shares of 724 Solutions Common
Stock in the United States (including shares to be issued under 724 Solutions'
2000 Stock Option Plan), from the registration and prospectus requirements under
applicable Canadian securities laws on terms reasonably satisfactory to 724
Solutions and Ezlogin.

other representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours upon

Ezlogin's normal business operations, during the period prior to the Effective
Time to (i) all of Ezlogin's properties, books, contracts, commitments and

which shall remain in effect pursuant to its terms during and after the term
hereof.

    (b) Subject to compliance with applicable law, from March 30, 2000 until the
Effective Time, each of 724 Solutions and Ezlogin shall confer on a regular and
frequent basis with one or more representatives of the other party to report
operational matters of materiality and the general status of ongoing operations.

    (c) No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to
this Section 5.3 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or

consummate the Merger.

    (d) Ezlogin shall promptly provide 724 Solutions and its accountants,
counsel and other representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of Ezlogin's Tax

transactions contemplated hereby.

    5.5 CONSENTS; COOPERATION.

    (a) Each of 724 Solutions and Ezlogin shall promptly apply for or otherwise

under any federal or state antitrust or fair trade law.

    (b) Each of 724 Solutions and Ezlogin shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated

                                       27

by this Agreement under the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other Federal,
state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). In
connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of 724
Solutions and Ezlogin shall cooperate and use all commercially reasonable
efforts vigorously to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent (each an "Order"),
that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the
Merger or any such other transactions, unless by mutual agreement 724 Solutions
and Ezlogin decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, it is
expressly understood and agreed that neither party shall have any obligation to
litigate or contest any administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any
Order beyond the date of a ruling preliminarily enjoining the Merger issued by a
court of competent jurisdiction. Each of 724 Solutions and Ezlogin shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to cause
the expiration of the notice periods under applicable Antitrust Laws with
respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this
Agreement.

    (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.5(a) or (b),
(i) 724 Solutions shall not be required to divest any of its or its subsidiaries
businesses, product lines or assets, or to take or agree to take any other
action or agree to any limitation that could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on 724 Solutions or on the Surviving Corporation after
the Effective Time.

    5.6 AFFILIATES.  Schedule 5.6 sets forth those persons who may be deemed
"Affiliates" of Ezlogin within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act ("Rule 145"). Ezlogin shall provide 724 Solutions such
information and documents as 724 Solutions shall reasonably request for purposes
of reviewing such list. As provided in the Voting Agreement, the 724 Solutions
Common Stock issued to Affiliates hereunder shall be subject restrictions on
transfer pursuant to Rule 145 under the Securities Act and 724 Solutions shall
be entitled to place appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing any 724
Solutions Common Stock to be received by such Affiliates pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and to issue appropriate stock
transfer instructions to the transfer agent for 724 Solutions Common Stock.

    5.7 LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.  Each of 724 Solutions and Ezlogin shall take all
reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements that
may be imposed on them with respect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and will promptly cooperate with and furnish
information to any party hereto necessary in connection with any such
requirements imposed upon such other party in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will take all reasonable
actions necessary to obtain (and will cooperate with the other parties hereto in
obtaining) any consent, approval, order or authorization of, or any
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or other
person, required to be obtained or made in connection with the taking of any
action contemplated by this Agreement.

    5.8 SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.

    (a) Ezlogin shall promptly after the date of the Original Merger Agreement
take all action necessary in accordance with California Law and its Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Ezlogin
Shareholders meeting or, if requested by 724 Solutions, to secure the written
consent of its Shareholders as soon as possible, but in no event later than five
(5) days or such later date as may be required by the California Commissioner of
Corporations, after the date of a favorable determination in the Fairness
Hearing and the issuance of the Permit. Ezlogin shall consult with 724 Solutions
regarding the date of the Ezlogin Shareholders Meeting and shall not postpone or
adjourn (other than for the absence of a quorum) the Ezlogin Shareholders
Meeting without the consent of 724 Solutions. Ezlogin shall use its reasonable
best efforts to solicit from Shareholders of Ezlogin proxies or consents in
favor of the Merger and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the vote or consent of Shareholders required to effect the Merger.

                                       28
<PAGE>
    (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, promptly after the
execution of this Agreement, Ezlogin, in consultation with 724 Solutions, will
prepare an Information Statement (the "Fairness Hearing Information Statement")
to be used in connection with obtaining the approval by the Shareholders of this
Agreement. Ezlogin shall not distribute the Fairness Hearing Information
Statement without 724 Solutions' approval; provided, that 724 Solutions shall in
no way be responsible for any of the content of the Fairness Hearing Information
Statement except as it pertains to and is supplied by 724 Solutions. Each of
Ezlogin and 724 Solutions shall ensure that the Fairness Hearing Information
Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading with respect to Ezlogin or 724 Solutions, as the case may be.
Whenever either of Ezlogin or 724 Solutions, as the case may be, obtains any
Knowledge of any event that should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement
to the Fairness Hearing Information Statement or 724 Solutions disclosure
documents, Ezlogin or 724 Solutions, as the case may be, will promptly inform
724 Solutions or Ezlogin, as the case may be, and will cooperate in mailing to
the Shareholders or the Optionholders as requested by 724 Solutions such
amendment or supplement.

    (c) Ezlogin, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, in accordance
with all applicable legal requirements and Ezlogin's charter and bylaws:

    cause the Fairness Hearing Information Statement and any other disclosure
    documents deemed appropriate by 724 Solutions to be mailed to the
    Shareholders and Optionholders of Ezlogin promptly upon completion thereof
    and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as soon as practicable a
    meeting (or, if requested by 724 Solutions, solicit an action by written
    consent in lieu thereof) (the "Ezlogin Shareholders Meeting") of the
    Shareholders for the purpose of voting to approve and adopt this Agreement
    (and the 280G Payments, to the extent applicable), to the extent required in
    accordance with legal requirements, and use its best efforts to obtain such
    Shareholder approval;

    recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement (and the 280G Payments, to
    the extent applicable) and the other transaction agreements to which Ezlogin
    is a party by the Shareholders of Ezlogin, and include in the Fairness
    Hearing Information Statement such recommendation, and take all lawful
    action to solicit such approval; and

    to the extent that the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
    Agreement result in the acceleration of vesting of stock options and
    restricted stock awards with respect to Ezlogin's stock which may cause an
    excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or the nondeductibility of a
    deduction under Section 280G of the Code (the "280G Payments"), Ezlogin
    shall include in the disclosure documents to be mailed to the Shareholders
    pursuant to subsection (i) above, a golden parachute disclosure (which shall
    be subject to the approval of 724 Solutions, not to be unreasonably
    withheld), for the purpose of soliciting the vote of the Shareholders (or,
    if requested by 724 Solutions, an action by written consent in lieu thereof)
    to approve the 280G Payments such that they shall not constitute "parachute
    payments" for purposes of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, by such vote
    as is required by the Code and any other applicable legal requirements, and
    Ezlogin shall use its best efforts to obtain such Shareholder approval.

    724 Solutions may at its discretion request Ezlogin to pursue either a
Shareholder Meeting or a solicitation of written consents, and 724 Solutions'
requesting of either such method shall not preclude a request for the other.

    (d) The timing and procedures of such meeting (or consent solicitation)
shall be subject to the reasonable approval of 724 Solutions and, if applicable,
shall be completed as promptly as practicable after the issuance of the Permit.

    5.9 EZLOGIN OPTIONS AND EZLOGIN CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES.

    (a) OUTSTANDING OPTIONS.  Schedule 2.2 of the Ezlogin Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true and complete list as of May 9, 2000 of all holders of
outstanding options under the Ezlogin Stock Option Plan, including the number of
shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock subject to each such option, the exercise or
vesting schedule, the exercise price per share and the term of each such option.
On the Closing Date, Ezlogin shall deliver to 724 Solutions an updated
Schedule 2.2 current as of such date.

                                       29
<PAGE>
    (b) ASSUMPTION OF EZLOGIN STOCK OPTION PLAN.  If, pursuant to
Section 1.6(c) hereof, 724 Solutions assumes Ezlogin Stock Options in connection
with the Merger:

        (i) At the Effective Time, the Ezlogin Stock Option Plan and each
    outstanding Ezlogin Option, whether vested or unvested, will be assumed by
    724 Solutions. Each such Ezlogin Option so assumed by 724 Solutions (as so
    assumed, the "Assumed Options") shall continue to have, and be subject to,
    the same terms and conditions set forth in the Ezlogin Stock Option Plan and
    the applicable stock option agreement immediately prior to the Effective
    Time, except that:

           a.  such option will be exercisable for that number of whole shares
       of 724 Solutions Common Stock equal to the product of the number of
       shares of Ezlogin Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
       option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by the
       Exchange Ratio, and rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
       724 Solutions Common Stock; and

           b.  the per share exercise price for the shares of 724 Solutions
       Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed option will be equal
       to the quotient of the exercise price per share of Ezlogin Common Stock
       at which such option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
       Time, divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
       cent.

The date of grant of each Assumed Option shall be the date on which such Ezlogin
Option was originally granted. Consistent with the terms of the Ezlogin Stock
Option Plan and the documents governing the Ezlogin Options, the Merger will not
terminate any of the outstanding options under the Ezlogin Stock Option Plan or,
except as disclosed in Schedule 2.2 hereof, accelerate the vesting of such
Ezlogin Options. It is the intention of the parties that the Ezlogin Options so
assumed by 724 Solutions qualify, to the maximum extent permissible, following
the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the
Code to the extent such options qualified as incentive stock options prior to
the Effective Time.

        (ii) NOTICE OF ASSUMPTION.  As soon as reasonably practical after the
    Effective Time, 724 Solutions will deliver to each person who, at the
    Effective Time, was a holder of an outstanding Ezlogin Option a notice
    stating that:

           a.  such Ezlogin Option has been assumed by 724 Solutions and shall
       continue in effect subject to the terms and conditions applicable thereto
       immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided
       herein;

           b.  the number of shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock covered by
       such Ezlogin Option and the per share exercise price for such shares of
       724 Solutions Common Stock;

           c.  and the number and identification of Ezlogin Options which are
       Subject Options.

        (iii) ASSIGNMENT OF REPURCHASE RIGHT.  All outstanding rights of Ezlogin
    immediately prior to the Effective Time to repurchase shares of Ezlogin
    Common Stock under the Ezlogin Stock Option Plan and pursuant to any Ezlogin
    Options shall be assigned to 724 Solutions in the Merger and shall
    thereafter be exercisable by 724 Solutions upon the same terms and
    conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that
    the shares purchasable pursuant to such right and the purchase price per
    share shall be adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio.

        (iv) AMENDMENT OF EZLOGIN STOCK OPTION PLAN.  Prior to Closing, Ezlogin
    shall take all necessary or appropriate actions (including amending the
    Ezlogin Stock Option Plan and any option agreements, if required, and
    soliciting the consent of the Optionholders) to:

           a.  make such amendments as 724 Solutions shall reasonably determine
       are necessary to comply with Canadian securities laws that will become
       applicable to the Ezlogin Stock Option Plan at the Effective Time or
       otherwise by reason of the Merger; and

           b.  provide for the cancellation or termination of Subject Options to
       satisfy any indemnity obligation of the Optionholders pursuant to
       Article VIII hereof, and the distribution of Subject Shares to the Escrow
       Agent, to the extent applicable, pursuant to Article VIII of this
       Agreement.

                                       30
<PAGE>
        (v) REGISTRATION.  724 Solutions shall use reasonable best efforts to
    file (provided that 724 Solutions has received all option documentation
    relating to the outstanding Ezlogin Options):

           a.  no later than one day following the termination of the IPO Lockup
       (as defined in the Holders' Agreements), a registration statement on
       Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering the shares of 724 Solutions
       Common Stock issuable pursuant to outstanding Assumed Options granted to
       individuals then providing services to Ezlogin as employees or
       consultants; and

           b.  no later than February 1, 2001, a registration statement on
       Form S-3 under the Securities Act covering the shares of 724 Solutions
       Common Stock issuable pursuant to outstanding Assumed Options granted to
       entities or to individuals not then providing services to Ezlogin as
       employees or consultants under the Ezlogin Stock Option Plan assumed by
       724 Solutions or otherwise issued in compensatory transactions to
       entities or to individuals not then providing services to Ezlogin as
       employees or consultants.

           (c) EXERCISE OR TERMINATION OF EZLOGIN OPTIONS.  If, pursuant to
       Section 1.6(c), 724 Solutions does not assume the Assumed Options in
       connection the Merger:

        (i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all Ezlogin Options then
    outstanding under the Ezlogin Stock Option Plan, whether or not vested, may
    be exercised in full by the holders thereof. Any Ezlogin Option outstanding
    under the Ezlogin Stock Option Plan will be terminated at the Effective Time
    if not exercised prior to the Effective Time.

        (ii) AMENDMENT OF EZLOGIN STOCK OPTION PLAN.

           a.  Subject to Section 5.9(c)(ii)(b) below, immediately following the
       execution and delivery of a Holders' Agreement by each holder of an
       unvested Ezlogin Option, Ezlogin shall cause (x) each Ezlogin Option
       (and, to the extent necessary, the Ezlogin Stock Option Plan) held by a
       non-United States taxpayer to be amended to allow (1) the immediate
       exercise of such Ezlogin Option (including as to unvested shares) and
       (2) payment of the exercise price of such Ezlogin Option with a
       full-recourse promissory note (with such terms as are described below and
       in a form reasonably satisfactory to 724 Solutions); and (y) each Ezlogin
       Option (and, to the extent necessary, the Ezlogin Stock Option Plan) held
       by a United States taxpayer to be amended to allow the immediate exercise
       of such Ezlogin Option (including as to unvested shares). Each promissory
       note shall (A) be secured by the 724 Solutions Common Stock to be
       received by such holder in the Merger and any other shares of
       724 Solutions Common Stock which may be received by such holder in the
       future (excluding shares purchased by such Shareholder on the open
       market), (B) have an interest rate equal to the lowest interest rate
       prescribed by such holder's income tax law to avoid the imputation of
       interest income; (C) mature on the one (1) year anniversary of the
       Closing; (D) provide that if at any time while such note is outstanding
       the holder debtor sells his shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock received
       in the Merger, all amounts owing under such promissory note shall
       accelerate and become due and payable on the tenth (10th) day following
       any such sale and if the holder debtor voluntarily terminates his
       employment with Ezlogin (or its successor) or is terminated by Ezlogin
       (or its successor) "for cause," all amounts owing under such promissory
       note shall accelerate and become due and payable on the fifth (5th) day
       following any such termination; and (E) have such other terms as may be
       reasonably required by Ezlogin. The promissory notes issued pursuant to
       this Section 5.9(c)(ii) shall not exceed US $528,000 in the aggregate.
       Also, in furtherance of the above, Ezlogin shall amend and restate each
       option agreement entered into by an Optionholder pursuant to the Ezlogin
       Stock Option Plan in the form of the Ezlogin Stock Option Agreement
       (Immediately Exercisable), attached hereto as Exhibit J.

           b.  If any holder of an unvested Ezlogin Option does not execute and
       deliver a Holders' Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date, such
       holder's option agreement(s) covering the unvested Ezlogin Options held
       by such holder shall not be amended as provided in Section 5.9(c)(ii)(a)
       hereof, and all of such holder's unvested Ezlogin Options shall not be
       assumed by 724 Solutions and shall terminate as of the Effective Time and
       such holder shall not be entitled to receive any Merger Consideration or
       other consideration therefor.

        (iii) POST CLOSING LOANS TO EZLOGIN OPTIONHOLDERS.  After January 1,
    2001, but not later than April 1, 2001, the Surviving Corporation shall
    extend loans to no more than 16 Shareholders, in an aggregate amount not to
    exceed US $666,000.00. Each such loan shall be fully secured by the shares
    of 724 Solutions Common Stock received by such Shareholder in the Merger and
    any other shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock which may be received by such
    Shareholder in the future (excluding shares purchased by such Shareholder on
    the open market), and evidenced by a full-recourse promissory note, with a
    term which shall not extend past the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing
    Date, with interest at the "prime rate" as published by the Wall Street
    Journal (or, if the Wall Street Journal no longer publishes such rate, a
    comparable publication) on the day of the loan, and such other terms as may
    be reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation and 724 Solutions. Each
    promissory note shall also provide that if at any time while such note is
    outstanding the Shareholder debtor sells his shares of 724 Solutions Common
    Stock received in the Merger, all amounts owing under such promissory note
    shall accelerate and become due and payable on the tenth (10th) day
    following any such sale and if the Shareholder debtor voluntarily terminates
    his employment with Surviving Corporation (or its successor) or is
    terminated by Surviving Corporation (or its successor) "for cause," all
    amounts owing under such promissory note shall accelerate and become due and
    payable on the fifth (5th) day following any such termination.

    (d) CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES.  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all
Ezlogin Convertible Securities, whether or not presently convertible shall be
converted into shares of Ezlogin Common Stock by Ezlogin or exercised by the
holders thereof, as applicable.

    5.10 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYEE PLANS.  At or prior to the Closing, Ezlogin
shall execute and deliver all necessary instruments and documents and do and

Schedule 2.14 other than employee welfare benefit plans (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA).

    (a) At the Effective Time, 724 Solutions shall grant the following options
to purchase 724 Solutions Common Stock under 724 Solutions' 2000 Stock Option
Plan, or another plan maintained by 724 Solutions which comports with the
requirements of applicable French law to allow the favorable treatment for such
options issued to French employees, which options will be subject to 724
Solutions' standard terms and conditions, including vesting, provided such terms
are allowed under the requirements of applicable French law to allow the
favorable treatment for such options issued to French employees (the "724
Solutions Options"): (i) 100,000 724 Solutions Options to selected key Ezlogin
employees (such allocation to be mutually agreed upon by 724 Solutions and
Ezlogin); and (ii) 75,000 724 Solutions Options to Jean-Noel Lebrun. The
exercise price for the 724 Solutions Stock Options shall be the closing price
for a share of 724 Solutions Common Stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market
for the trading day immediately preceding the Closing. The number of
724 Solutions Options granted hereunder shall be adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into or exchangeable for
724 Solutions Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to 724 Solutions Common Stock occurring after March 30, 2000
and prior to the Effective Time.

    (b) Ezlogin employees after the Closing will be eligible to receive
additional options to purchase 724 Solutions Common Stock pursuant to existing
option plans of 724 Solutions. The number, vesting and timing of grants of such
options shall be based on criteria applied to other similarly situated 724
Solutions employees.

    (c) The 724 Solutions Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise of such
724 Solutions Options has been duly and validly reserved for issuance and, upon
issuance in accordance with the terms of 724 Solutions' 2000 Stock Option Plan,
or any such other plan, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable, free of any liens or encumbrances (other than any liens or
encumbrances created by the holder thereof) and free of restrictions on transfer
other than restrictions on transfer under this Agreement and applicable Canadian
Securities Laws and United States state and federal securities laws or other
applicable French laws.

    (d) 724 Solutions shall use reasonable best efforts to file, no later than
the day following the termination of the IPO Lockup (as defined in the Holders'
Agreements) a registration statement on Form S-8 under the

    made as of the time of the occurrence, existence or discovery of such event,
    condition, fact or circumstance, or (2) such event, condition, fact or
    circumstance had occurred, arisen or existed on or prior to the date of the

satisfied. On the Closing Date, Ezlogin shall deliver to 724 Solutions an update
of the Ezlogin Disclosure Schedule, current as of such date.

    5.18 DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION.  The certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification of directors and
officers than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
Merger Sub as of March 30, 2000, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of three years from the Effective Date in any
manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who at
the Effective Time were directors and officers of Ezlogin, unless such
modification shall be required by applicable law. The provisions of this
Section 5.18 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and are expressly
intended to benefit each of the individuals who at the Effective Time were
directors and officers of Ezlogin.

    5.19 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.  Following the Effective Time and until at
least December 31, 2000, 724 Solutions, in its sole and absolute discretion,
shall either: (a) continue (or cause Ezlogin to continue) to maintain the
Ezlogin Employee Plans (excluding the Ezlogin Stock Option Plan and any bonus,
referral bonus or incentive payment arrangements (other than with respect to
amounts accrued or earned prior to the Effective Time)) (the "Ezlogin Welfare
Plans") on substantially the same terms in the aggregate as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (b) arrange for each participant in
the Ezlogin Welfare Plans ("Ezlogin Participants") to participate in 724
Solutions' (or its applicable subsidiary's) plans which are, in the aggregate,
and taking into account benefits provided pursuant to the provisions of
applicable law, in substance no less favorable, on a plan-by-plan basis, than
those provided to other similarly situated (as to seniority, job description and
salary, not as to location) employees of 724 Solutions and its other
subsidiaries from time to time ("724 Solutions Plans"), or (c) a combination of
clauses (a) and (b). Each Ezlogin Participant who continues to be employed by
724 Solutions (or any of its subsidiaries) immediately following the Effective
Time shall, to the extent permitted by law and applicable tax qualification
requirements, and subject to any generally applicable break in service or
similar rule, receive credit for all purposes, including without limitation, for
eligibility to participate and vesting under 724 Solutions Plans for years of
service with Ezlogin prior to the Effective Time. If option (b) or (c) is
elected and subject to the approval of any insurance carrier and to the extent
consistent with law and applicable tax qualification requirements, 724 Solutions
shall then cause any and all pre-existing condition (or actively-at-work or
similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any group health plans to be waived with respect to such
Ezlogin Participants and their eligible dependents and shall provide them with
credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar payments) prior
to the Effective Time for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible,
out-of-pocket, or similar requirements under any 724 Solutions Plans in which
they are eligible to participate after the Effective Time. Provided, however,
that Ezlogin (or its successor entity) or the applicable insurance carrier shall
make available a HIPAA Certificate evidencing prior coverage under the
corresponding Ezlogin Welfare Plan. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the
contrary, none of the provisions contained herein shall operate to duplicate any
benefit provided to any Ezlogin Participant or the funding of any such benefit.
Further and in no way in limitation of the foregoing, 724 Solutions and its
subsidiaries shall provide benefit programs to employees of Ezlogin that are
subject to the laws in France that comply with the rules, regulations, and laws
of that country. Nothing in this Section 5.19 shall be construed to entitle any
employee to continue his or her employment for any period of time, nor to
interfere with the rights of 724 Solutions or Ezlogin to discharge or discipline
any employee, to change the terms of any employee's employment, or to amend or
terminate employee benefit plans or programs at any time (subject to
Section 5.10).

    5.20 ISSUANCE OF RESTRICTED SECURITIES.  In the event, and only in the
event, 724 Solutions shall not have received a favorable determination in the
Fairness Hearing and a Permit covering all of the shares of 724 Solutions Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger such that the issuance qualifies for exemption
under the 3(a)(10) Exemption:

        (a) SHAREHOLDERS' CONSENT.

           (i) Ezlogin shall immediately after the date of 724 Solutions'
       receipt of an unfavorable determination in the Fairness Hearing take all
       action necessary in accordance with California Law and its Articles of
       Incorporation and Bylaws to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
       Ezlogin Shareholders Meeting or, if requested by 724 Solutions, to secure
       the written consent of its Shareholders as soon as possible, but in no
       event later than five (5) days, after the date of such unfavorable
       determination in the Fairness Hearing. Ezlogin shall consult with 724
       Solutions regarding the date of the Ezlogin Shareholders Meeting and
       shall not postpone or adjourn (other than for the absence of a quorum)
       the Ezlogin Shareholders Meeting without the consent of 724 Solutions.
       Ezlogin shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from
       Shareholders of Ezlogin proxies or consents in favor of the Merger and
       shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or
       consent of Shareholders required to effect the Merger.

           (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, immediately
       after 724 Solutions' receipt of an unfavorable determination in the
       Fairness Hearing, Ezlogin, in consultation with 724 Solutions, will
       prepare an Information Statement in compliance with the requirements
       under the California Corporations Code and Rule 506 under the Securities
       Act (the "Rule 506 Information Statement"), which shall also include an
       offering circular prepared by 724 Solutions, which shall comply as to
       form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
       provisions of the Securities Act, the Blue Sky Laws and all rules and
       regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Offering Circular," and,
       collectively with the Rule 506 Information Statement, the "Rule 506
       Documents") to be used in connection with obtaining the approval by the
       Shareholders of this Agreement. Ezlogin shall not distribute the
       Rule 506 Documents without 724 Solutions' approval; provided, that 724
       Solutions shall in no way be responsible for any of the content of the
       Rule 506 Documents except for the Offering Circular and content in the
       Rule 506 Information Statement as it pertains to and is supplied by 724
       Solutions. Each of Ezlogin and 724 Solutions shall ensure that the
       Rule 506 Documents do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
       or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
       necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
       under which they were made, not misleading with respect to Ezlogin or 724
       Solutions, as the case may be. For these purposes, Ezlogin, may in
       consultation with 724 Solutions, amend or supplement the Fairness Hearing
       Information Statement, to the extent necessary, to incorporate all
       information and disclosures required by Rule 506 promulgated under the
       Securities Act. Whenever either of Ezlogin or 724 Solutions, as the case
       may be, obtains any Knowledge of any event that should be set forth in an
       amendment or a supplement to the Rule 506 Documents or 724 Solutions
       disclosure documents, Ezlogin or 724 Solutions, as the case may be, will
       promptly inform 724 Solutions or Ezlogin, as the case may be, and will
       cooperate in mailing to the Shareholders and Optionholders as requested
       by 724 Solutions such amendment or supplement.

           (iii) Ezlogin, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, in
       accordance with all applicable legal requirements and Ezlogin's charter
       and bylaws:

               a.  cause the Rule 506 Information Statement, the Offering
           Circular, and any other disclosure documents deemed appropriate by
           724 Solutions to be mailed to the Shareholders and Optionholders of
           Ezlogin promptly upon completion thereof and duly call, give notice
           of, convene and hold as soon as practicable a meeting (or, if
           requested by 724 Solutions, solicit an action by written consent in
           lieu thereof) of such Shareholders for the purpose of voting to
           approve and adopt this Agreement (and the 280G Payments, to the
           extent applicable), to the extent required in accordance with legal
           requirements, and use its best efforts to obtain such Shareholder
           approval;

               b.  recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement (and the
           280G Payments, to the extent applicable) and the other transaction
           agreements to which Ezlogin is a party by the

                                       35
<PAGE>
           Shareholders of Ezlogin, and include in the Rule 506 Information
           Statement such recommendation, and take all lawful action to solicit
           such approval; and

               c.  to the extent that the Merger and the transactions
           contemplated by this Agreement result in the acceleration of vesting
           of stock options and restricted stock awards with respect to
           Ezlogin's stock which may constitute 280G Payments, Ezlogin shall
           include in the disclosure documents to be mailed to the Shareholders
           pursuant to subsection (a) above, a golden parachute disclosure
           (which shall be subject to the approval of 724 Solutions, not to be
           unreasonably withheld), for the purpose of soliciting the vote of the
           Shareholders (or, if requested by 724 Solutions, an action by written
           consent in lieu thereof) to approve the 280G Payments such that they
           shall not constitute "parachute payments" for purposes of
           Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, by such vote as is required by
           the Code and any other applicable legal requirements, and Ezlogin
           shall use its best efforts to obtain such Shareholder approval.

    724 Solutions may at its discretion request Ezlogin to pursue either a
Shareholder meeting or a solicitation of written consents, and 724 Solutions'
requesting of either such method shall not preclude a request for the other.

           (iv) The timing and procedures of such meeting (or consent
       solicitation) shall be subject to the reasonable approval of 724
       Solutions and, if applicable, shall be completed as promptly as
       practicable after the issuance of the unfavorable determination in the
       Fairness Hearing.

        (b) REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT.  724 Solutions and each Ezlogin
    Shareholder shall execute and deliver a Registration Rights and Investment
    Representations Agreement in the form of Exhibit D attached hereto
    ("Registration Rights Agreement").

    5.21 AMENDMENT OF BONUS SHARE AGREEMENTS.  Ezlogin shall, on or prior to
Closing, use its reasonable best efforts to enter into an amendment to each
agreement to which Ezlogin is a party and which provides for the payment of any
Bonus Shares to any employee, consultant or other third party (the "Bonus Share
Agreements") with the other parties thereto to allow for the payment of, at the
option of 724 Solutions, (a) 724 Solutions Common Stock, as adjusted for the
Exchange Ratio, or (b) cash having a value equal to the number of shares of
Ezlogin Common Stock otherwise payable thereunder multiplied by the 724
Solutions Stock Price, in substitution for such shares. The Bonus Share
Agreements shall also be amended to provide that such employees, consultants or
other third parties will enter into such agreements and deliver reasonable
investment representations, to the extent required by 724 Solutions, in
connection with the issuance of the 724 Solutions Common Stock under such
amended Bonus Share Agreements.

    5.22 OTHER ACTIONS.  Ezlogin shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each of Vincent Guesdon and Lance Mayfield to execute and deliver an Employee
Inventions and Proprietary Assignment Agreement with Ezlogin, in Ezlogin's
standard form.

    seeking any of the foregoing be pending; nor shall there be any action
    taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, entered, enforced
    or deemed applicable to the Merger, that makes the consummation of the
    Merger illegal. In the event an injunction or other order shall have been
    issued, each party agrees to use its reasonable efforts to have such
    injunction or other order lifted.

        (c) GOVERNMENTAL APPROVAL.  724 Solutions and Ezlogin shall have timely

    representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date, they shall be
    true in all respects as of such earlier date), except (x) as otherwise
    contemplated by this Agreement and (y) for such failures to be true and
    correct which in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be
    expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on 724 Solutions without giving
    regard to materiality qualifiers in any individual representation, and
    (ii) 724 Solutions shall have performed and complied in all material
    respects with all covenants, obligations and conditions of this Agreement
    required to be performed and complied with by it as of the Effective Time.

    Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati a certificate, dated as of the Effective
    Time, certifying that, to

                                       37

    724 Solutions' Knowledge neither 724 Solutions nor any of its Affiliates has
    taken or agreed to take any action, nor does 724 Solutions have Knowledge of
    any fact or circumstance relating to 724 Solutions, that would prevent
    (i) the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
    Section 368(a) of the Code, or (ii) the exchange of shares of Ezlogin
    Capital Stock for shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock from meeting the

    Solutions' 2000 Stock Option Plan pursuant to Section 5.11 hereof).

        (f) REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT.  In the event 724 Solutions shall not
    have received a favorable determination in the Fairness Hearing and a Permit
    covering all of the shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock to be issued in the
    Merger such that the issuance qualifies for exemption under the 3(a)(10)

    failures to be true and correct which in the aggregate have not had and
    would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
    Ezlogin without giving regard to materiality qualifiers in any individual
    representation, and (ii) Ezlogin shall have performed and complied in all

    foregoing be pending.

        (e) LEGAL OPINION.  724 Solutions shall have received a legal opinion
    from Ezlogin's legal counsel, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati (which
    opinion may be shared with another law firm reasonably acceptable to 724

    but which shall nevertheless contain opinions as to the enforceability of
    this Agreement, the capitalization of Ezlogin, the

<PAGE>
    valid issuance or grant, as the case may be, of all Ezlogin securities
    (including Ezlogin Options) in accordance with all applicable securities
    laws, and other customary opinions given by the target's counsel in
    acquisitions of this type.

    Solutions for the purpose of rendering such opinion. In connection with the
    above, but without limiting the foregoing, Ezlogin shall deliver to
    724 Solutions and Morrison & Foerster LLP a certificate, dated as of the
    Effective Time, certifying that, to Ezlogin's Knowledge neither Ezlogin nor
    any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, nor does
    Ezlogin have Knowledge of any fact or circumstance relating to Ezlogin, that
    would prevent (i) the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
    meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, or (ii) the exchange of shares of
    Ezlogin Capital Stock for shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock from meeting
    the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(i).

        (i) FIRPTA CERTIFICATE.  Ezlogin shall, prior to the Closing Date,
    provide 724 Solutions with a properly executed FIRPTA Notification Letter,
    substantially in the form of Exhibit H attached hereto, which states that
    shares of capital stock of Ezlogin do not constitute "United States real
    property interests" under Section 897(c) of the Code, for purposes of
    satisfying 724 Solutions' obligations under Treasury Regulation
    Section 1.1445-2(c)(3). In addition, simultaneously with delivery of such
    Notification Letter, Ezlogin shall have provided to 724 Solutions, as agent
    for Ezlogin, a form of notice to the Internal Revenue Service in accordance
    with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2) and
    substantially in the form of Exhibit I attached hereto along with written
    authorization for 724 Solutions to deliver such notice form to the Internal
    Revenue Service on behalf of Ezlogin upon the Closing of the Merger.

        (j) RESIGNATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.  The directors and officers
    of Ezlogin in office immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have
    resigned as directors and officers, as applicable, of Ezlogin effective as
    of the Effective Time.

        (k) EZLOGIN OPTIONS AND EZLOGIN CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES.  Unless 724
    Solutions is assuming Ezlogin Options in connection with the Merger,
    pursuant to Section 1.6(c), all outstanding Ezlogin Options shall have been
    exercised or terminated. All Ezlogin Convertible Securities (excluding Bonus
    Shares, to the extent not accrued or paid prior to the Effective Time) shall
    have been converted.

        (l) EMPLOYMENT AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENTS.  Concurrently with the
    execution of this Agreement, the Key Employees of Ezlogin set forth on
    Schedule 5.15(a) shall have entered into Employment and Non-Competition
    Agreements with Ezlogin and each Key Employee shall be employed by Ezlogin
    as of the Effective Time and shall have not notified (whether formally or
    informally) Ezlogin of such employee's intention to terminate his employment
    with Ezlogin as of the Effective Time. Concurrently with the execution of
    this Agreement, certain of the Other Employees, as set forth on
    Schedule 5.15(b), shall have entered into Employment Agreements with
    Ezlogin, and, on or prior to the Closing, certain of the Other Employees as
    set forth on Schedule 5.15(b) shall have entered into an Employment
    Agreement with Ezlogin and each such Other Employee shall be employed by
    Ezlogin as of the Effective Time and shall have not notified (whether
    formally or informally) Ezlogin of such employee's intention to terminate
    his employment with Ezlogin as of the Effective Time; provided, that the
    failure of one or more Other

                                       39
<PAGE>
    Employees to enter into an Employment Agreement due to death, disability or
    illness shall not prevent the satisfaction of this condition at the Closing.

        (m) HOLDERS' AGREEMENTS.  Each Shareholder and Optionholder shall have
    delivered an Employee Holders' Agreement or a Non-Employee Shareholders'
    Agreement, as provided in Section 5.2 hereof and all other documents
    required to be delivered thereunder, including, without limitation,
    evidence, reasonably satisfactory to 724 Solutions that (1) each Holder who
    is not an individual shall have the authority and power to execute each
    Transaction Agreement to which it is or is to become a party and the
    individual executing Transaction Agreements has the authority to do so on
    Holder's behalf, as the case may be; provided that the execution and
    delivery of a Certificate of Trust by a Holder which is a trust, and an
    Incumbency Certificate by a Holder which is a corporate entity or
    partnership (in the forms attached as exhibits to the Holders' Agreements)
    shall be deemed to satisfy this condition; but provided further, that
    notwithstanding the above, in the event 724 Solutions has a reasonable
    belief that such certificate is materially untrue or contains a material
    misstatement of fact, 724 Solutions may demand additional reasonable
    evidence from such Holder as to such authority; and (2) any lienholder over
    shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock or Ezlogin Options shall have agreed to be
    subject to the transfer restrictions and Unvested Share Repurchase Option
    set forth in Section 5.2 hereof or the Holder shall have discharged any such
    lien.

        (n) CERTIFICATES OF GOOD STANDING.  Ezlogin shall, prior to the Closing
    Date, provide 724 Solutions a certificate from the Secretary of State of
    California as to Ezlogin's good standing and payment of all applicable
    taxes.

        (o) ISSUANCE OF PARENT COMMON STOCK.  Prior to the issuance of the 724
    Solutions Common Stock in the Merger, either (i) 724 Solutions shall have
    received a favorable determination in the Fairness Hearing and have been
    issued a Permit covering all of the shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock to
    be issued in the Merger such that the issuance qualifies for exemption under
    the 3(a)(10) Exemption, or (ii) in the event 724 Solutions shall not have
    received a favorable determination in the Fairness Hearing and a Permit
    covering all of the shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock to be issued in the
    Merger such that the issuance qualifies for exemption under the 3(a)(10)
    Exemption:

           (i) each Shareholder shall have executed and delivered to 724
       Solutions a Registration Rights Agreement;

           (ii) the Rule 506 Documents shall have been mailed to the
       Shareholders of Ezlogin in accordance with Section 5.20(a); and

          (iii) 724 Solutions shall reasonably be satisfied that there are no
       more than 35 Shareholders who are not "accredited investors," and that
       each Shareholder who is not an "accredited investor" shall, either alone
       or through appropriate representation by a "purchaser representative" (as
       such terms used in the Securities Act and the rules promulgated
       thereunder), have such knowledge and experience in financial and business
       matters that such Shareholder is capable of evaluating the merits and
       risks of the prospective investment in the 724 Solutions Common Stock;
       provided that the execution and delivery of the Registration Rights
       Agreement with no exceptions to the representations and warranties and a
       customary investor questionnaire, with reasonably acceptable answers
       thereon, shall be deemed to satisfy this condition; but provided further,
       that notwithstanding the above, in the event 724 Solutions has a
       reasonable belief that any relevant representation or the questionnaire
       is materially untrue or contains a material misstatement of fact, 724
       Solutions may demand additional reasonable evidence from such Shareholder
       as to such Shareholder's investor status.

        (p) DISSENTERS.  The holders of no more than 10% of the outstanding
    shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock shall have elected to, or otherwise be
    entitled to, exercise their rights to dissent from the Merger.

        (q) SIDE LETTER.  Jonqille Investment Limited shall have executed and
    delivered the side letter to be entered into with 724 Solutions, in a form
    reasonably acceptable to 724 Solutions.

    on or prior to June 30, 2000, or such other date, if any, as 724 Solutions
    and Ezlogin shall agree upon; PROVIDED, that the party seeking to terminate

    representation, warranty, obligation or agreement hereunder and such breach
    shall not have been cured within thirty (30) business days of receipt by
    Ezlogin of written notice of such breach such that the conditions set forth
    in Section 6.3(a) would not be satisfied, provided that the right to
    terminate this Agreement by 724 Solutions under this Section 7.1(c) shall
    not be available to 724 Solutions where 724 Solutions is at that time in
    material breach of this Agreement.

    representation, warranty, obligation or agreement hereunder and such breach
    shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt by 724
    Solutions of written notice of such breach such that the conditions set
    forth in Section 6.2(a) would not be satisfied provided that the right to

    this Agreement,

    7.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION.  In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of 724 Solutions or Ezlogin or
their respective officers, directors, shareholders or affiliates, except to the
extent that such termination results from the intentional, willful or negligent
breach by a party hereto of any of its representations or warranties, or any
breach of covenants, set forth in this Agreement; provided that the provisions
of Section 5.3 (Access to Information; Confidentiality), Section 7.3 (Expenses)
and this Section 7.2 and of Article IX shall remain in full force and effect and
survive any termination of this Agreement.

    7.3 EXPENSES.  Except as otherwise provided herein, whether or not the

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                           ESCROW AND INDEMNIFICATION

    8.1 ESCROW FUND AND SUBJECT OPTIONS.

    (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Escrow
Shares shall be registered in the name of, and be deposited with, U.S. Bank
Trust, N.A. (or another institution selected by 724 Solutions with the
reasonable consent of Ezlogin) as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), such
deposit (together with interest and other income thereon) to constitute the
Escrow Fund and to be governed by the terms set forth herein and in the Escrow
Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit E. The number of Escrow Shares beneficially
owned by each Shareholder will be set forth on Schedule 1 to the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate 724 Solutions
pursuant to the indemnification obligations of the Shareholders of Ezlogin.

    (b) If, pursuant to Section 1.6(c), 724 Solutions assumes the Ezlogin Option
Plan in connection with the Merger, the Subject Options shall be held by 724
Solutions and the Subject Shares shall be held in the Escrow Fund as security
against the Optionholders' indemnity obligations set forth in this Article VIII
and shall be available to compensate 724 Solutions for certain damages, subject
to and in accordance with the provisions of this Article VIII and the Employee
Holders' Agreements.

    8.2 INDEMNIFICATION AND SURVIVAL.

    (a) Ezlogin's representations and warranties set forth in Article II or in
any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive until the first
anniversary of the Closing, provided, however that Ezlogin's representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 shall survive the Closing and
continue into perpetuity. All of 724 Solutions' or Merger Sub's representations
and warranties contained herein or in any instrument delivered pursuant hereto
shall terminate at the Effective Time.

    (b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, the Holders
will indemnify and hold harmless 724 Solutions and its officers, directors,
agents and employees, and each person, if any, who controls or may control 724
Solutions within the meaning of the Securities Act (hereinafter referred to
individually as a "724 Solutions Indemnified Person" and collectively as "724
Solutions Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all losses, costs,
damages, liabilities and expenses arising from claims, demands, actions, causes
of action, including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees, net of any
recoveries by 724 Solutions under existing insurance policies or indemnities
from third parties (collectively, "724 Solutions Damages") arising out of any
misrepresentation or breach of or default in connection with any of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements given or made by Ezlogin
in this Agreement, the Ezlogin Disclosure Schedules or any exhibit or schedule
to this Agreement; provided, that 724 Solutions Damages arising out of any
breach of Ezlogin's representations and warranties in Section 2.11 hereof shall
not include losses in the nature of incidental or consequential damages, lost
profits, diminution in value, damage to reputation or goodwill or other items of
a speculative nature ("Consequential Damages"); and provided, further, that 724
Solutions Damages arising out of any other breach of Ezlogin's representations
and warranties herein shall not include Consequential Damages except for losses
in the nature of lost profits based on 724 Solution's business history
(including its operations, customer base and income streams as of the Effective
Time). It is the intent of the parties that all indemnification obligations of
the Holders set forth in this Agreement shall apply without regard to whether or
not (i) the Holders are negligent or otherwise at fault in any respect with
regard to the existence or occurrence of any of the matters covered by any such
indemnification obligation, and (ii) the Holders otherwise caused or created, or
are claimed to have caused or created, the existence or occurrence of any of the
matters covered by any such indemnification obligation, whether through their
own acts or omissions or otherwise.

    (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holders' total
indemnification obligations pursuant to this Article VIII shall not exceed 10%
of the Merger Consideration (the "Indemnification Cap") valued at the 724
Solutions Stock Price, and no Holder shall have liability for any 724 Solutions
Damages unless and until Officer's Certificates (as defined in Section 8.5
below) identifying aggregate 724 Solutions Damages in excess of $375,000 (the
"Indemnification Threshold") have been received by the Escrow Agent, in which
case 724 Solutions shall be entitled to recover all 724 Solutions Damages;
provided that all 724 Solutions Damages relating to the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 2.2 and 2.38 (collectively, the "Excluded
Damages") shall not be subject to either the Indemnification Cap or the
Indemnification Threshold.

                                       42
<PAGE>
    (d) The Escrow Fund and, if applicable, the Subject Options shall be the
exclusive security for this indemnity obligation of the Holders subject to the
limitations in this Agreement. The exclusive remedy for 724 Solutions against
any Holder in connection with this indemnity obligation shall be to make a claim
against the Escrow (and, if applicable, a corresponding termination of Subject
Options) or such Shareholder or Optionholder directly, in accordance with and
pursuant to this Article VIII; provided, that, subject to Section 8.2(e) below,
724 Solutions shall not proceed against the Optionholders directly for the
recovery of Excluded Damages (but shall be able to proceed against the
Optionholders' interests in the Escrow Fund and the Subject Options) and
provided, further, that 724 Solutions shall not proceed against the Shareholders
directly for Excluded Damages until the earlier of the expiration of the Escrow
Period and the distribution of all amounts in the Escrow Fund to 724 Solutions
and, if applicable, the cancellation or release of all Subject Options by 724
Solutions in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and this Article VIII. After
the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Escrow Period; or (ii) the payment of
all amounts in the Escrow Fund to 724 Solutions and the cancellation of all
Subject Options by 724 Solutions, subject to Section 8.2(e) below, the
Shareholders' liability under this Article VIII shall be several and not joint
and limited to the same proportion of the 724 Solutions Damages as such
Shareholder's share of the shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock issued to such
Shareholder in the Merger bears to all shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock
issued to all Shareholders in the Merger. Subject to Section 8.2(e) below, in no
event shall 724 Solutions proceed directly against any Optionholder.

    (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit the liability (i) of Ezlogin or 724 Solutions for any
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant if the Merger does not close;
or (ii) of any Holders in connection with any breach by such Holder (in such
Holder's capacity as such) of any Transaction Agreement executed by such Holder,
including the Voting Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the
applicable Holders' Agreement.

    8.3 PAYMENT FOR 724 SOLUTIONS DAMAGES.  Upon 724 Solutions' delivery of an
Officer's Certificate or Certificates identifying 724 Solutions Damages to the
Escrow Agent and Shareholders' Agent as provided in Section 8.5 below and the
determination that such amount is payable pursuant to this Article VIII, 724
Solutions shall receive Escrow Shares from the Escrow Fund and shall terminate
Subject Options equal in value to the full amount of 724 Solutions Damages (with
such Escrow Shares and Subject Options being valued pursuant to Section 8.5(b)
below); provided, however, that in no event shall 724 Solutions receive more
than the number of shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock originally placed in the
Escrow Fund or added to the Escrow Fund upon the exercise of any Subject
Options, or terminate more than the original number of Subject Options, if any.
Any Escrow Shares delivered to 724 Solutions from the Escrow Fund and any
Subject Options terminated by 724 Solutions in accordance herewith shall be
deducted pro-rata from each Shareholder and Optionholder, as the case may be.

    (b) Payment of 724 Solutions Damages shall be taken ratably from Escrow
Shares and, if 724 Solutions assumes the Ezlogin Stock Option Plan, the
cancellation of Subject Options. For each payment of 724 Solutions Damages
satisfied by canceling Subject Options, each Optionholder shall have his pro
rata share of Subject Options cancelled with such Optionholder's vested and
unvested Subject Options being cancelled ratably (including with respect to
vesting dates). If applicable, 724 Solutions shall receive Escrow Shares ratably
from the Holders' Escrow Shares not subject to an Unvested Share Repurchase
Option and from Escrow Shares subject to an Unvested Share Repurchase Option
(including with respect to lapsing dates).

    8.4 ESCROW PERIOD.

    (a) The Escrow shall terminate on the one year anniversary of the Effective
Time (the "Escrow Period"); provided, however, that a portion of the Escrow
Shares which is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any
Officer's Certificate theretofore delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to
termination of the Escrow Period with respect to facts and circumstances
existing prior to expiration of the Escrow Period, less a number of Escrow
Shares equal to the number of Subject Options that remain subject to
cancellation pursuant to the remainder of this clause (a), shall remain in the
Escrow Fund until such claims have been resolved. 724 Solutions shall deliver to
the Escrow Agent a certificate specifying the Effective Time. 724 Solutions
shall release the remaining Subject Options upon the expiration of the Escrow
Period; provided, however, that a portion of the Subject Options which is
necessary to satisfy the Optionholders' pro rata portion of any

                                       43
<PAGE>
unsatisfied claims specified in any Officer's Certificate theretofore delivered
to the Escrow Agent and the Shareholders' Agent prior to termination of the
Escrow Period with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to
expiration of the Escrow Period shall remain subject to cancellation pursuant to
the provisions of this Article VIII until such claims have been resolved.

    (b) Any amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund after the Escrow Period that
are not in dispute relating to the indemnification obligations of the
Shareholders arising under this Agreement shall be promptly distributed to the
Shareholders (including Shareholders of Subject Shares), and any Subject Options
then outstanding that are not in dispute relating to the indemnification
obligations of the Optionholders arising under this Agreement shall be promptly
released to the Optionholders. As soon as all such disputed claims have been
resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Shareholders their pro-rata
share of all remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund and not required to satisfy
such claims and expenses. Each Shareholder shall receive that number of Escrow
Shares equivalent to such Shareholder's pro-rata percentage interest in the
Escrow Fund as set forth in Schedule 1 attached to the Escrow Agreement. As soon
as all such disputed claims have been resolved, 724 Solutions shall release to
each Optionholder its Subject Options not otherwise terminated in accordance
herewith.

    8.5 CLAIMS UPON ESCROW FUND.

    (a) In order to receive Escrow Shares or cancel Subject Options as
compensation for 724 Solutions Damages, 724 Solutions must first deliver to the
Escrow Agent and the Shareholders' Agent, on or before the last day of the
Escrow Period, a certificate signed by any officer of 724 Solutions (an
"Officer's Certificate"), stating that 724 Solutions Damages exist and
specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of such 724 Solutions
Damages included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid, or
properly accrued in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or arose, and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or claim to which such item is related and
the specific representation, warranty or covenant alleged to have been the
subject of such misrepresentation, breach or default. The Officer's Certificate
shall also specify the amount of Escrow Shares to be delivered to 724 Solutions
and the number of Subject Options, if any, to be cancelled if the claim
represented in the Officer's Certificate were to be paid. Upon receipt of the
Officer's Certificate, (i) the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of
Sections 8.6 and 8.7 below, deliver to 724 Solutions out of the Escrow Fund, as
promptly as practicable, 724 Solutions Common Stock or other assets held in the
Escrow Fund having a value equal to the portion of such 724 Solutions Damages
attributable to the indemnity obligations of the Shareholders hereunder; and
(ii) 724 Solutions shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 8.6 and 8.7
below, cancel Subject Options equal to the portion of such 724 Solutions Damages
attributable to the indemnity obligations of the Optionholders hereunder.

    (b) For the purpose of compensating 724 Solutions for its 724 Solutions
Damages pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Shares and, if applicable, the
Subject Options shall be valued at the 724 Solutions Stock Price.

    (c) If the value to be distributed to 724 Solutions with respect to each
Shareholder or Optionholder is not evenly divisible by the 724 Solutions Stock
Price, the number of Escrow Shares to be delivered to 724 Solutions and the
number of Subject Options to be cancelled will be rounded down to the next
highest number of shares or options. The fractional interests remaining will be
aggregated with future claims against the Escrow Fund and Subject Options, and
will be delivered to 724 Solutions or cancelled when any fractional shares in
the aggregate are equal to a whole number of shares or options. Upon the release
of the Escrow Fund, 724 Solutions may elect to distribute the fractional
interests to the Shareholders and Optionholders or to monetize such fractional
interests in exchange for a pro rata payment of the 724 Solutions Stock Price,
to be paid as provided with respect to fractional shares in the manner set for
in Section 1.6(e).

    8.6 OBJECTIONS TO CLAIMS.  At the time of delivery of any Officer's
Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such Officer's Certificate
shall be delivered to the Shareholders' Agent and for a period of forty-five
(45) days after such delivery to the Escrow Agent and the Shareholders' Agent of
such Officer's Certificate, (i) the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery of 724
Solutions Common Stock or other property pursuant to Section 8.5 hereof unless
the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the
Shareholders' Agent to make such delivery; and (ii) 724 Solutions shall not
terminate Subject Options pursuant

                                       44
<PAGE>
to Section 8.5 hereof unless 724 Solutions shall have received written
authorization from the Shareholders' Agent to cancel such Subject Options. After
the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period, (i) the Escrow Agent shall
make delivery of the 724 Solutions Common Stock or other property in the Escrow
Fund, in accordance with Section 8.5 hereof; and (ii) 724 Solutions shall
terminate Subject Options, in accordance with Section 8.5 hereof, provided that
no such payment, delivery or termination may be made if the Shareholders' Agent
shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officer's
Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent
and to 724 Solutions prior to the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period.

    8.7 RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS; ARBITRATION.

    (a) In case the Shareholders' Agent shall so object in writing to any claim
or claims by 724 Solutions made in any Officer's Certificate, 724 Solutions
shall have forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Escrow Agent and 724
Solutions of an objection by the Shareholders' Agent to respond in a written
statement to the objection of the Shareholders' Agent. If after such forty-five
(45) day period there remains a dispute as to any claims, the Shareholders'
Agent and 724 Solutions shall attempt in good faith for sixty (60) days to agree
upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims.
If the Shareholders' Agent and 724 Solutions should so agree, a memorandum
setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and
shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
rely on any such memorandum and shall distribute the 724 Solutions Common Stock
or other property from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.

    (b) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either
724 Solutions or the Shareholders' Agent may, by written notice to the other,
demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or loss is at
issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall
not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration
conducted by three arbitrators. Within fifteen (15) days after such written
notice is sent, 724 Solutions and the Shareholders' Agent shall each select one
arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator.
The decision of the arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in
such Officer's Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to
this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in Section 8.6 hereof, the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or
withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund and 724 Solutions shall be entitled to
terminate Subject Options, in accordance therewith.

    (c) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara
County, California under the commercial rules then in effect of the American
Arbitration Association. For purposes of this Section 8.7(c), in any arbitration
hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the Officer's
Certificate is at issue, 724 Solutions shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing
Party unless the arbitrators award 724 Solutions more than one-half ( 1/2) of
the amount in dispute, plus any amounts not in dispute; otherwise, the
Shareholders and Optionholders for whom shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock
otherwise issuable to them have been deposited in the Escrow Fund, or who hold
Subject Options, as applicable, shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party.
The Non-Prevailing Party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees
of each arbitrator, the administrative fee of the American Arbitration
Association, and the expenses, including without limitation, attorneys' fees and
costs, reasonably incurred by the other party to the arbitration. If the
Shareholders and the Optionholders are deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party,
such expenses and fees shall be paid first, from the Escrow Shares and the
cancellation of Subject Options, and second, by 724 Solutions, provided that the
Shareholders and Optionholders shall be and remain liable to 724 Solutions for
the amount that the total of all such fees and expenses exceeds the total Escrow
Shares and Subject Options, valued at the 724 Solutions Stock Price (the "Excess
Fees"), and the Shareholders and Optionholders, severally, hereby indemnify and
hold harmless the 724 Solutions Indemnified Persons from and against all such
Excess Fees.

    8.8 SHAREHOLDERS' AGENT.

    (a) By executing a Holders' Agreement, voting to approve the Merger or
accepting any Merger Consideration, each Shareholder and each Optionholder
appoints Alexandre Balkanski as agent ("Shareholders'

                                       45
<PAGE>
Agent") for and on behalf of such Holder to give and receive notices and
communications, to authorize delivery to 724 Solutions of the 724 Solutions
Common Stock or other property from the Escrow Fund and, if applicable, the
cancellation of Subject Options, in satisfaction of claims by 724 Solutions, to
object to such deliveries and cancellations, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of
courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholders' Agent for
the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the holders
of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund and the Subject Options from time
to time upon not less than ten (10) days' prior written notice to 724 Solutions.
No bond shall be required of the Shareholders' Agent, and the Shareholders'
Agent shall receive no compensation for his services. Notices or communications
to or from the Shareholders' Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of
the Ezlogin Shareholders and Optionholders.

    (b) The Shareholders' Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Shareholders' Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise
of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Ezlogin
Shareholders and Optionholders shall severally indemnify the Shareholders' Agent
and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without
gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Shareholders' Agent and arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties
hereunder.

    (c) The Shareholders' Agent shall have reasonable access to information
about Ezlogin, the Surviving Corporation and 724 Solutions and the reasonable
assistance of Ezlogin's, the Surviving Corporation's and 724 Solutions'
respective officers and employees for purposes of performing its duties and
exercising its rights hereunder, provided that the Shareholders' Agent shall
treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about
Ezlogin, the Surviving Corporation or 724 Solutions to anyone (except on a need
to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such information
confidentially).

    (d) Alexandre Balkanski hereby agrees to act as the Shareholders' Agent
pursuant to the terms hereof.

    8.9 ACTIONS OF THE SHAREHOLDERS' AGENT.  A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Shareholders' Agent shall constitute a decision of all
Shareholders with an interest in the Escrow Fund and all Optionholders holding
Subject Options and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such
Shareholder and Optionholder, and the Escrow Agent and 724 Solutions may rely
upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders' Agent as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such
Shareholder and Optionholder. The Escrow Agent, 724 Solutions, Ezlogin and the
Surviving Corporation are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for
any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Shareholders' Agent.

    8.10 THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS.  In the event 724 Solutions becomes aware of a
third-party claim which 724 Solutions believes may result in a demand against

this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

    9.4 COUNTERPARTS; FACSIMILE DELIVERY.  This Agreement may be executed in one

considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart.

    9.5 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NONASSIGNABILITY; PARTIES IN INTEREST.  This Agreement
and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to
herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the Exhibits, the Schedules,
including the Ezlogin Disclosure Schedule (a) constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties

    9.6 SEVERABILITY.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will
continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other
persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

exercise of any other remedy.

    9.8 GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed,
interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California,
without regard to conflict of laws. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court located within the States of

of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be
served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the States of

applicable provisions of the laws of the State of California ("California Law"),

                                      A-1
<PAGE>
    2.2 Effective Time; Closing.  This Agreement shall be effective upon filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of California (the time of such filing,
the "Effective Time").

    2.3 Effect of the Merger.  The effect of the Merger shall be as provided in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of California Law. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

    2.4 Articles of Incorporation.  At the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated as set forth in
Exhibit A attached hereto.

    2.5 Effect on Capital Stock.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities, the
following shall occur:

        (i) Company Common Stock.  At the Effective Time, each share of Company
    Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
    (excluding any shares of Company Common Stock cancelled pursuant to
    Section 2.5(ii) and excluding any Dissenting Shares (as defined in
    Section 2.6)) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted
    into the right to receive 0.0719513 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of the
    Common Stock of Parent ("Parent Common Stock").

        (ii) Cancellation of Company-Owned Stock.  At the Effective Time, all
    shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury
    stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
    extinguished without any conversion thereof.

        (iii) Company Preferred Stock.  Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
    all Company Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be automatically
    converted into shares of Company Common Stock.

        (iv) Merger Sub Common Stock.  At the Effective Time, each share of
    Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
    Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
    nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per share, of the
    Surviving Corporation.

        (v) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio.  The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
    to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
    dividend (including any dividend or general distribution of securities
    convertible into or exchangeable for Parent Common Stock or Company Capital
    Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect
    to Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock occurring after March 30,
    2000 and prior to the Effective Time.

        (vi) Fractional Shares.  No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
    will be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Capital
    Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent
    Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
    to be received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash
    (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such
    fraction, multiplied by (ii) $40.5750, less any amount required to be
    withheld under foreign, federal, state or local tax laws.

    2.6 Dissenting Shares.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has
demanded and perfected dissenters' rights for such shares in accordance with
California Law and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn
or lost such dissenters' rights ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
into the right to receive Parent Common Stock but shall instead be converted
into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to California Law. If, after the
Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting
Shares, such shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the
right to receive the number of shares of Parent Common Stock into which such
shares would otherwise be converted under Section 2.5.

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

    3.1 Further Action.  If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or
to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of either the
Company or Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
are fully authorized to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary
action.

    3.2 Multiple Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which when taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement shall
become effective when one or more counterparts has been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to each of the other parties.

    3.3 Choice of Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of California, without reference to choice
of law provisions.

    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their duly authorized respective officers as of the date first
written above.

                                VOTING AGREEMENT

    THIS VOTING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of March 30,
2000 by and between 724 Solutions Inc., a corporation amalgamated under the laws

                                    RECITALS

    A.  This Agreement is entered into in connection with the Agreement and Plan
of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of March 30, 2000, among 724 Solutions,
Ezlogin, Merger Sub and Shareholders' Agent, as the same may be amended (the

    B.  Shareholder holds and/or has options to acquire shares of Ezlogin
Capital Stock (the "Shares").

    C.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each
outstanding share of Ezlogin Capital Stock will be converted into the right to
receive shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock (the "724 Solutions Shares") and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares thereof.

    D.  Shareholder is entering into this Agreement as a material inducement to,
and in consideration of, 724 Solutions' willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement.

                                   AGREEMENT

    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the mutual agreements,
provisions and covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement and in this
Agreement, it is hereby agreed as follows:

    1. AGREEMENT TO RETAIN SHARES.  Shareholder agrees not to directly or
indirectly offer, sell, assign, transfer, encumber, pledge, contract to sell,
sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to
sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise dispose
of, any Shares or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for Shares or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale,
assignment, transfer, pledge, grant or disposal ("Transfer"), or deposit any
Shares into a voting trust or grant a proxy or enter into an agreement of any
kind with respect to the voting of any Shares, except for the Proxy at any time
prior to the Expiration Date (as defined in the Proxy), other than as may be
otherwise permitted in the Transaction Agreements, including Section 2 of the
applicable Shareholders' Agreement.

    2. AGREEMENT TO VOTE SHARES.  Prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the
Effective Time of the Merger, and (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement, at
every meeting of the Shareholders called with respect to any of the following,
and at every adjournment thereof, and on every action or approval by written
resolution of the Shareholders with respect to any of the following, Shareholder
shall vote all Shares in favor of approval of the Merger and any matter that
could reasonably be expected to facilitate the Merger.

    3. IRREVOCABLE PROXY.  Contemporaneously with the execution of this
Agreement, Shareholder is delivering to 724 Solutions a duly executed proxy in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Proxy") with respect to each and
every meeting of Shareholders or action or approval by written resolution of
Shareholders prior to the Expiration Date, such Proxy to cover all Shares in
respect of which Shareholder is entitled to vote at any such meeting or in
connection with any such written consent.

    4. NO SOLICITATION.  Until the Expiration Date, Shareholder will not (and
will use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause Ezlogin, its affiliates,
officers, directors and employees and any investment banker, attorney,
accountant or other agent retained by Shareholder or them, not to):
(i) initiate or solicit, directly or indirectly, any proposal, plan or offer to
acquire all or any substantial part of the business or properties or capital
stock of Ezlogin, whether by merger, purchase of assets, tender offer or
otherwise, or to liquidate Ezlogin or otherwise distribute to the shareholders
of Ezlogin all or any substantial part of the business, properties or capital
stock of Ezlogin (each, an "Acquisition Proposal"); (ii) initiate, directly or
indirectly, any contact with any person in an

                                      B-1
<PAGE>
effort to or with a view towards soliciting any Acquisition Proposal;
(iii) furnish non-public information concerning Ezlogin's business, properties
or assets to any corporation, partnership, person or other entity or group
(other than 724 Solutions, or any associate, agent or representative of
724 Solutions) under any circumstances that could reasonably be expected to
result in an Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) negotiate or enter into discussions
or an agreement, directly or indirectly, with any entity or group with respect
of any potential Acquisition Proposal. In the event Shareholder shall receive or
become aware of any Acquisition Proposal subsequent to the date hereof,
Shareholder shall promptly inform 724 Solutions as to any such matter and the
details thereof.

    5. AFFILIATE AGREEMENT.

    (a) If Shareholder is determined by Ezlogin or 724 Solutions to be (but does
not hereby admit to be) an "affiliate" of Ezlogin within the meaning of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act in connection with the Merger, then (unless
Shareholder has been advised by 724 Solutions that the issuance of the Shares in
the Merger will not be registered under the Securities Act in reliance upon the
exemption of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act rather than Section 3(a)(10) of
the Securities Act), Shareholder shall not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose
of the Shares issued to Shareholder in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer
or other disposition is made in conformity with the requirements of Rule 145(d)
promulgated under the Act, or (ii) Shareholder delivers to 724 Solutions a
written opinion of counsel, reasonably acceptable to 724 Solutions in form and
substance, that such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt
from registration under the Securities Act.

    (b) To the extent Shareholder is deemed to be an "affiliate" of Ezlogin,
724 Solutions will give stop-transfer instructions to its transfer agent with
respect to the Shares received by Shareholder pursuant to the Merger and there
will be placed on the certificates representing such Shares, or any
substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

    "The shares represented by this certificate may only be transferred in
    conformity with Rule 145(d) or in accordance with a written opinion of
    counsel, reasonably acceptable to the issuer in form and substance, that
    such transfer is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of
    1933."

    The legend set forth above shall be removed (by delivery of a substitute
certificate without such legend) if Shareholder delivers to 724 Solutions
(i) satisfactory written evidence that the shares have been sold in compliance
with Rule 145 (in which case, the substitute certificate will be issued in the
name of the transferee), or (ii) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to 724 Solutions, to the effect that public sale of the
shares in the U.S. by the holder thereof is no longer subject to Rule 145.

    6. ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS; PRIOR AGREEMENTS.  Shareholder hereby covenants and
agrees to execute and deliver any additional documents necessary or desirable,
in the reasonable opinion of 724 Solutions, to carry out the purpose and intent
of this Agreement. Shareholder also agrees that all the shares of 724 Solutions
Common Stock issued in the Merger (including any Escrow Shares and any cash paid
in lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to satisfy all rights pertaining
to the Ezlogin Capital Stock and any other rights or agreements relating thereto
shall be of no further force or effect, except as otherwise contemplated by the
Merger Agreement.

    7. CONSENT AND WAIVER.  Shareholder hereby gives any consents or waivers
that are reasonably required for the consummation of the Merger under the terms
of any agreement to which Shareholder is a party or pursuant to any rights
Shareholder may have.

    8. CONFIDENTIALITY.  Shareholder agrees (i) to hold any information
regarding this Agreement and the Merger in strict confidence, and (ii) not to
divulge any such information to any third person, until such time as the Merger
has been publicly disclosed by 724 Solutions or Shareholder is legally compelled
to disclose such information.

    9. MISCELLANEOUS.

    (a) AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION.  This Agreement may not be modified,
amended, altered or supplemented except by the execution and delivery of a
written agreement executed by the parties hereto.

                                      B-2
<PAGE>
    (b) ASSIGNMENT.  This Agreement will be binding upon, and inure to the
benefit of, the persons or entities who are permitted, by the terms of this
Agreement, to be successors, assigns, transferees and personal representatives
of the respective parties hereto.

    (c) COSTS OF ENFORCEMENT.  If any party to this Agreement seeks to enforce
its rights under this Agreement by legal proceedings or otherwise, the
non-prevailing party will pay all costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing
party, including, without limitation, all reasonable attorneys' and experts'
fees.

    (d) COUNTERPART EXECUTION; FACSIMILE DELIVERY.  This Agreement may be
executed in several counterparts and delivered by facsimile, each of which shall
be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

    (e) EFFECT OF HEADINGS.  The section headings herein are for convenience
only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

    (f) ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement and the exhibits hereto contains the
entire understanding of the parties in respect of the subject matter hereof, and
supersede all prior negotiations and understandings between the parties with
respect to such subject matter.

    (g) FURTHER ASSURANCES.  Shareholder agrees to execute and deliver, before
or after the Effective Time, any additional documents reasonably necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

    (h) GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed,
interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California,
without regard to conflict of laws. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
consents to the jurisdiction of any court located within the State of New York
or the State of California, in connection with any matter based upon or arising
out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process
may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of
California for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any
objection that they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such process.
EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN CONNECTION
WITH ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION
AGREEMENTS OR THE ENFORCEMENT OF ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHER
TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS.

                          EMPLOYEE HOLDERS' AGREEMENT

    THIS EMPLOYEE HOLDERS' AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as
      , 2000 by and between 724 Solutions Inc., a corporation amalgamated under
the laws of Ontario ("724 Solutions"), and the undersigned ("Holder").

                                    RECITALS

    This Agreement is entered into in connection with the First Amended and
Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of May 9,
2000, among 724 Solutions, Ezlogin.com, Inc. ("Ezlogin"), Sapphire Merger
Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub") and the Shareholders' Agent named therein (as the same
may be amended, the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be
merged with and into Ezlogin. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger
Agreement.

    Holder holds, and/or has options to acquire, shares of Ezlogin Capital
Stock.

    Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each outstanding
share of Ezlogin Capital Stock will be converted into the right to receive
shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock (the "724 Solutions Shares") and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares thereof. All Ezlogin options then outstanding
under the Ezlogin Stock Option Plan (the "Ezlogin Options") will be assumed by
724 Solutions (as such, the "Assumed Options") or, if prior to the Closing
724 Solutions shall not have received written confirmation from the Nasdaq
National Market that a vote of the 724 Solutions shareholders will not be
required in connection with such assumption, will become exercisable and, if
exercised, the resulting shares of Ezlogin Common Stock will be converted into
the right to receive 724 Solutions Shares.

    It is currently contemplated that the 724 Solutions Shares will be issued to
Holder pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof, pursuant to a permit (the
"Permit") to be issued by the California Commissioner of Corporations after a
Fairness Hearing. In the event the Permit is not issued following the Fairness
Hearing, the 724 Solutions Shares shall, if the exemption is available, be
issued in a private placement as "restricted securities" as defined under
Rule 144 of the Securities Act.

    The 724 Solutions Shares issued in the Merger and, if applicable, upon the
exercise of Assumed Options, will be subject to contractual transfer
restrictions, including a lock-up. Additionally, certain of such 724 Solutions
Shares issued in the Merger and, if applicable, certain of the Assumed Options
and certain of the 724 Solutions Shares issued upon exercise thereof, will be
subject to an escrow or cancellation, as applicable, as security for Holder's
indemnity obligations under Article VIII of the Merger Agreement.

    If 724 Solutions does not assume the Ezlogin Options in connection the
Merger, then the 724 Solutions Shares issued in exchange for shares of Ezlogin
Capital Stock issued upon the early exercise of Ezlogin Options ("Repurchase
Shares") will be subject to a repurchase right held by 724 Solutions (the
"Repurchase Option").

    Holder is entering into this Agreement as a material inducement to, and in
consideration of, 724 Solutions' willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement.

                                   AGREEMENT

    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, representations,
warranties, covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the parties
mutually agree as follows:

    REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS.  Holder hereby represents,
warrants and covenants to 724 Solutions as follows:

        OWNERSHIP OF EZLOGIN CAPITAL STOCK.  Holder now owns and will own
    immediately prior to the Effective Time (including shares held both
    beneficially and of record and shares held either beneficially or of record)
    such number of shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock and/or the number of Ezlogin
    Options as is set forth on

                                     C-1-1
<PAGE>
    Schedule 1. Holder does not directly or indirectly own, either beneficially
    or of record, any shares of capital stock of Ezlogin or rights to purchase
    or acquire or otherwise receive any shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock or
    Ezlogin Options or other securities of Ezlogin, whether vested, unvested or
    subject to any other contingency, other than the shares of Ezlogin Capital
    Stock and/or Ezlogin Options listed on Schedule 1.

        ABSENCE OF LIENS AND ENCUMBRANCES.  Except as provided on Schedule 1
    attached hereto, the shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock and/or the Ezlogin
    Options owned or held by Holder (including shares held both beneficially and
    of record and shares held either beneficially or of record) are now and at
    the Effective Time will be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
    None of the liens or encumbrances listed on Schedule 1 will prevent, delay
    or otherwise interfere with the conversion of shares in the Merger. Prior to
    Closing, Holder shall obtain any such lien holder's agreement in writing to
    be bound by the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction
    Agreements, or in the absence of such written agreement, Holder shall
    discharge the lien prior to Closing.

        CONVERSION OF PREFERRED STOCK/EXERCISE OF OPTIONS.  Immediately prior to
    the Effective Time of the Merger, Holder covenants (i) to convert any
    Ezlogin Preferred Stock into Ezlogin Common Stock and (ii) if the Ezlogin
    Options are not assumed by 724 Solutions, to exercise the Ezlogin Options.

    AUTHORITY, ENFORCEABILITY.

    Holder has the authority, legal capacity and financial capability to enter
into, execute, deliver and perform his obligations under this Agreement and each
of the other documents contemplated to be executed by Holder in connection with
the Merger Agreement, including, if applicable, the Voting Agreement, and to
perform the obligations of the "Shareholders," "Optionholders" or "Holders"
under Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, as applicable. This Agreement and each of the other Transaction
Agreements to which Holder is or is to become a party constitutes, or when
executed and delivered by Holder will constitute, a valid and binding obligation
of Holder enforceable against Holder in accordance with its terms, subject to
laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, and other similar laws and equitable principles relating to or
limiting creditors' rights generally, general equity principles, and limitations
upon rights to indemnity.

    Holder has delivered evidence, reasonably satisfactory to 724 Solutions,
that (1) Holder (if not an individual) has the authority and power to execute
this Agreement and the individual executing this Agreement has the authority to
do so on Holder's behalf; provided that the execution and delivery of a
Certificate of Trust by a Holder that is a trust, and an Incumbency Certificate
by a Holder that is a corporate entity or partnership (in the forms attached as
Exhibits 1 and 2 hereto) shall be deemed to satisfy this condition; but provided
further, that notwithstanding the above, in the event 724 Solutions has a
reasonable belief that such certificate is materially untrue or contains a
material misstatement of fact, 724 Solutions may demand additional reasonable
evidence from such Holder as to such authority; and (2) prior to the Closing
Date, any lienholder over shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock or Ezlogin Options
shall have agreed to be subject to the transfer restrictions and the Repurchase
Option set forth in Section 3 hereof, or Holder shall have discharged any such
lien.

    The execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by Holder and
each of the other Transaction Agreements to which Holder is or is to become a
party will not violate any other agreement to which Holder is a party, other
than any violation that would not prevent, materially alter or delay any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any such other Transaction
Agreement or result in any cost to 724 Solutions or the Surviving Corporation.
No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or
by any person is required in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of the Transaction Agreements by Holder or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, other than any consent, approval,
authorization, order, registration or qualification that would not prevent or
materially alter or delay any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any such other Transaction Agreement.

    If Holder is married, and the 724 Solutions Shares or Assumed Options do or
will constitute community property, this Agreement and each of the other
Transaction Agreements to which Holder is or is to become a party has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by, and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of, Holder's spouse, enforceable against such person in accordance
with its terms, subject to laws of general application relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and other similar laws and equitable

                                     C-1-2
<PAGE>
principles relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally, general equity
principles, and limitations upon rights to indemnity.

    Holder has not, at any time, taken or been the subject of any action that
may have an adverse effect on his ability to comply with or perform Holder's
covenants or obligations under any of the Transaction Agreements to which Holder
is or is to become a party.

    There is no private or governmental action, suit, proceeding, claim,
arbitration or investigation (collectively, a "Proceeding") pending, and no
person has threatened to commence any Proceeding, that may have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Holder to either comply with or perform his
covenants or obligations under any of the Transaction Agreements to which he is
or is to become a party. To the Knowledge of Holder, no event has occurred, and
no claim, dispute or other condition or circumstance exists, that might
reasonably be expected to directly or indirectly give rise to or serve as a
basis for the commencement of any such Proceeding.

    SECURITIES EXEMPTION.

    Holder acknowledges that 724 Solutions shall have no obligation, except as
otherwise provided in the Registration Rights Agreement, to register the
724 Solutions Shares under the Securities Act or any state securities laws or to
take any action that would make available any exemption from the registration
requirements of such laws.

    Holder further acknowledges that in the event the Permit is not issued, the
Merger may be consummated and 724 Solutions Shares shall be issued in connection
therewith pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act provided by Section 4(2) thereof. If the Permit is not issued
promptly following the Fairness Hearing, Holder shall execute and deliver to
724 Solutions, promptly upon request, a Registration Rights Agreement and shall
take such other reasonable steps as may be requested by 724 Solutions in
connection with such exemption and issuance. Holder understands that the
exemption pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act depends upon, among
other things, the bona fide nature of Holder's investment intent as expressed in
the Registration Rights Agreement.

    MERGER AGREEMENT; DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS.  Holder has received and carefully
reviewed copies of the Transaction Agreements (including the Escrow Agreement),
together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, and has had the opportunity to
discuss such Agreements with counsel and other advisors.

    WAIVER OF CERTAIN CLAIMS.  At the Effective Time of the Merger, Holder
waives any and all claims, demands, damages, actions, causes of action, suits or
proceedings, fixed or contingent, matured or unmatured, of whatever nature,
character, type of description that have been or in the future might be asserted
by Holder (or by any other person as successor to Holder) against Ezlogin or
against 724 Solutions or Merger Sub, or any of their respective predecessors,
successors or assigns, any past or present, direct or indirect, partner,
subsidiary, or affiliated entity or corporation, or any past or present
employee, agent, representative, attorney, officer, director or stockholder of
any of them acting in its capacity as such an employee, agent, representative,
attorney, officer, director or stockholder, arising out of facts or
circumstances occurring at any time on or prior to the date hereof and relating
to such person's ownership of Ezlogin Capital Stock or any rights or options to
acquire Ezlogin Capital Stock (either beneficially or of record), or any
federal, state or local law, statute or regulation, at law or in equity, or any
act or omission on the part of such parties, other than matters relating to
Dissenting Shares.

    TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS.

    Holder may not, directly or indirectly:

        (i) offer, sell, assign, transfer, encumber, pledge, contract to sell,
    sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to
    sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise
    dispose of, any 724 Solutions Shares or any securities convertible into or
    exercisable or exchangeable for 724 Solutions Shares,

        (ii) or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale,
    assignment, transfer, pledge, grant or disposal,

                                     C-1-3
<PAGE>
(collectively "Transfer") its 724 Solutions Shares received in connection with
the Merger or upon the exercise of Assumed Options unless the restrictions under
this SECTION 2 and SECTION 3 have been released or complied with.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Holder may Transfer such 724 Solutions Shares
(i) if required by court order or by operation of law or in connection with the
settlement of such holder's estate, (ii) to a family member, (iii) to a trust
controlled by or for the benefit of Holder or a family member solely for tax or
estate planning purposes, or (iv) to any corporation, partnership, limited
liability company or other entity that, directly or indirectly, controls or is
controlled by Holder, provided that in each of (i), (ii), (iii) and
(iv) transferee agrees in writing to assume all the obligations of Holder under
this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements. In addition, Holder may
Transfer up to one-half of the 724 Solutions Shares it receives in the Merger
other than Repurchase Shares (which may not be transferred until they lose their
status as such) to his or her ex-spouse (or, if such Holder is a trust, to the
ex-spouse of an affiliate of such Holder) pursuant to a valid, court approved
divorce decree or in connection with a valid and enforceable divorce settlement
(provided, that for purposes of this Agreement a divorce settlement shall be
deemed to be valid and enforceable upon filing with the court), provided that
such transferee agrees to be bound by a Non-Employee Holder Agreement in the
form attached the Merger Agreement, in which case such shares shall be subject
to such Agreement rather than this Agreement.

    IPO Lock-Up. Until July 25, 2000, Holder will not:

        (i) Transfer any 724 Solutions Shares or any securities convertible into
    or exercisable or exchangeable for 724 Solutions Shares;

        (ii) exercise any and all rights to request or demand registration
    pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of the 724 Solutions
    Shares; or

       (iii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that Transfers to another,
    in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the
    724 Solutions Shares,

whether any such transaction described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above is to
be settled by delivery of 724 Solutions Shares, such other securities, in cash
or otherwise (the "IPO Lock-Up"). None of the above provisions shall be deemed
to prohibit Holder from exercising an option or a warrant to purchase
724 Solutions Shares.

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, until July 25, 2000, Holder shall be
permitted to Transfer:

        (i) 724 Solutions Shares or securities convertible into or exercisable
    or exchangeable for 724 Solutions Shares in a gratuitous Transfer (including
    a Transfer into a Registered Retirement Savings Plan), so long as the
    recipient of such securities executes a written agreement stating that such
    recipient will be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, and

        (ii) shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock purchased on or after the date
    hereof in the open market.

    In addition, if Holder is a corporation, partnership, limited liability
company or other entity, Holder shall be permitted during the period set forth
above to Transfer such securities to any entity that controls Holder, that is
controlled by Holder, or that is under common control with Holder, so long as
the recipient of such securities executes a written agreement stating that it
will be bound by the provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the IPO Lock-Up shall be of no further force and effect if Credit
Suisse First Boston Corporation ("CSFB") shall have consented to at least 50% of
the shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock subject to the lock-up agreement among
CSFB and the holders of shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock in connection with
724 Solutions' initial public offering (the "Lock-Up Agreement") taking any
action otherwise prohibited thereby. The foregoing release from the IPO-Lockup
shall not apply to a secondary offering of 724 Solutions Common Stock.

    Agent shall be of no effect, and each notice delivered by 724 Solutions or
    any other 724 Solutions Indemnified Person to the Shareholders' Agent shall
    be effective as against Holder; provided that 724 Solutions and the other
    724 Solutions Indemnified Persons may elect at their sole discretion to give

the Shareholders' Agent, Holder shall promptly (and in any event within thirty

                      NON-EMPLOYEE SHAREHOLDERS' AGREEMENT

    THIS NON-EMPLOYEE SHAREHOLDERS' AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into
as of             , 2000 by and between 724 Solutions Inc., a corporation
amalgamated under the laws of Ontario ("724 Solutions"), and the undersigned
(the "Shareholder").

                                    RECITALS

    A. This Agreement is entered into in connection with the Agreement and Plan
of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of March 30, 2000, among 724 Solutions,
Ezlogin, Merger Sub and Shareholders' Agent, as the same may be amended (the
"Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into
Ezlogin. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

    B.  Shareholder holds and/or has options to acquire shares of Ezlogin
Capital Stock.

    C.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each
outstanding share of Ezlogin Capital Stock will be converted into the right to
receive shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock (the "724 Solutions Shares") and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares thereof.

    D. It is currently contemplated that the 724 Solutions Shares will be issued
to the Shareholder pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof, pursuant to a permit
(the "Permit") to be issued by the California Commissioner of Corporations after
a Fairness Hearing. In the event the Permit is not issued following the Fairness
Hearing, the 724 Solutions Shares shall be issued in a private placement as
"restricted securities" as defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act.

    E.  The 724 Solutions Shares issued in the Merger shall be subject to
certain contractual transfer restrictions, including a lock-up.

    F.  Shareholder is entering into this Agreement as a material inducement to,
and in consideration of, 724 Solutions' willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement.

                                   AGREEMENT

    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, representations,
warranties, covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the parties
mutually agree as follows:

    1.  REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS.  Shareholder hereby
       represents, warrants and covenants to 724 Solutions as follows:

       (a) Ownership of Ezlogin Capital Stock. Shareholder now owns and will own
           immediately prior to the Effective Time (including shares held both
           beneficially and of record and shares held either beneficially or of
           record) such number of shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock as is set
           forth on Schedule 1. Shareholder does not directly or indirectly own,
           either beneficially or of record, any shares of capital stock of
           Ezlogin or rights to purchase or acquire or otherwise receive any
           shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock or other securities of Ezlogin,
           whether vested, unvested or subject to any other contingency, other
           than the shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock listed on Schedule 1.

       (b) Absence of Liens and Encumbrances. Except as provided on Schedule 1
           attached hereto, the shares of Ezlogin Capital Stock owned by
           Shareholder (including shares held both beneficially and of record
           and shares held either beneficially or of record) are now and at the
           Effective Time will be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
           None of the liens or encumbrances listed on Schedule 1 will prevent,
           delay or otherwise interfere with the conversion of shares in the
           Merger. Prior to Closing, Shareholder shall obtain any such lien
           holder's agreement in writing to be bound by the terms of this
           Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, or in the absence of
           such written agreement, Shareholder shall discharge the lien prior to
           Closing.

                                     C-2-1
<PAGE>
       (c) Exercise of Options; Conversion of Preferred Stock. Immediately prior
           to the Effective Time of the Merger, Shareholder covenants to
           exercise its options, if any, to acquire Ezlogin Common Stock and to
           convert any Ezlogin Preferred Stock into Ezlogin Common Stock.

       (d) AUTHORITY, ENFORCEABILITY.

            (i) Shareholder has the authority, legal capacity and financial
                capability to enter into, execute, deliver and perform his
                obligations under this Agreement and each of the other documents
                contemplated to be executed by Shareholder in connection with
                the Merger Agreement, including, if applicable, the Voting
                Agreement, and to perform the obligations of the "Shareholders"
                under Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other
                Transaction Agreements. This Agreement and each of the other
                Transaction Agreements to which Shareholder is or is to become a
                party constitutes, or when executed and delivered by Shareholder
                will constitute, a valid and binding obligation of Shareholder
                enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with its terms,
                subject to laws of general application relating to bankruptcy,
                insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and other similar laws
                and equitable principles relating to or limiting creditors'
                rights generally, general equity principles, and limitations
                upon rights to indemnity.

            (ii) Shareholder has delivered evidence, reasonably satisfactory to
                 724 Solutions that (1) Shareholder (if not an individual) has
                 the authority and power to execute this Agreement and the
                 individual executing this Agreements has the authority to do so
                 on the Shareholder's behalf; provided that the execution and
                 delivery of a Certificate of Trust by a Shareholder that is a
                 trust, and an Incumbency Certificate by a Shareholder that is a
                 corporate entity or partnership (in the forms attached as
                 Exhibits 1 and 2 hereto) shall be deemed to satisfy this
                 condition; but provided further, that notwithstanding the
                 above, in the event 724 Solutions has a reasonable belief that
                 such certificate is materially untrue or contains a material
                 misstatement of fact, 724 Solutions may demand additional
                 reasonable evidence from such Shareholder as to such authority;
                 and (2) prior to the Closing Date, any lienholder over shares
                 of Ezlogin Capital Stock shall have agreed to be subject to the
                 transfer restrictions or Shareholder shall have discharged any
                 such lien.

           (iii) The execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by
                 Shareholder and each of the other Transaction Agreements to
                 which Shareholder is or is to become a party will not violate
                 any other agreement to which Shareholder is a party, other than
                 any violation that would not prevent, materially alter or delay
                 any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
                 such other Transaction Agreement or result in any cost to
                 724 Solutions or the Surviving Corporation. No consent,
                 approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification
                 of or by any person is required in connection with the
                 execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction
                 Agreements by Shareholder or the consummation of the
                 transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, other than any
                 consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or
                 qualification that would not prevent or materially alter or
                 delay any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
                 any such other Transaction Agreement.

            (iv) If Shareholder is married, and the 724 Solutions Shares
                 constitute community property, this Agreement and each of the
                 other Transaction Agreements to which Shareholder is or is to
                 become a party has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
                 by, and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of,
                 Shareholder's spouse, enforceable against such person in
                 accordance with its terms, subject to laws of general
                 application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
                 moratorium, and other similar laws and equitable principles
                 relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally, general
                 equity principles, and limitations upon rights to indemnity.

            (v) Shareholder has not, at any time, taken or been the subject of
                any action that may have an adverse effect on his ability to
                comply with or perform Shareholder's covenants or obligations
                under any of the Transaction Agreements to which Shareholder is
                or is to become a party.

                                     C-2-2
<PAGE>
            (vi) There is no private or governmental action, suit, proceeding,
                 claim, arbitration or investigation (collectively, a
                 "Proceeding") pending, and no person has threatened to commence
                 any Proceeding, that may have a material adverse effect on the
                 ability of Shareholder to either comply with or perform his
                 covenants or obligations under any of the Transaction
                 Agreements to which he is or is to become a party. To the
                 Knowledge of Shareholder, no event has occurred, and no claim,
                 dispute or other condition or circumstance exists, that might
                 reasonably be expected to directly or indirectly give rise to
                 or serve as a basis for the commencement of any such
                 Proceeding.

       (e) SECURITIES EXEMPTION.

            (i) Shareholder acknowledges that 724 Solutions shall have no
                obligation, except as otherwise provided in the Registration
                Rights Agreement, to register the 724 Solutions Shares under the
                Securities Act or any state securities laws or to take any
                action that would make available any exemption from the
                registration requirements of such laws.

            (ii) Shareholder further acknowledges that in the event the Permit
                 is not issued, the Merger may be consummated and 724 Solutions
                 Shares issued in connection therewith pursuant to an exemption
                 from the registration requirements of the Securities Act
                 provided by Section 4(2) thereof. If the Permit is not issued
                 promptly following the Fairness Hearing, Shareholder shall
                 execute and deliver to 724 Solutions, promptly upon request, a
                 Registration Rights Agreement and shall take such other
                 reasonable steps as may be requested by 724 Solutions in
                 connection with such exemption and issuance. Shareholder
                 understands that the exemption pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
                 Securities Act depends upon, among other things, the bona fide
                 nature of Shareholder's investment intent as expressed in the
                 Registration Rights Agreement.

       (f) MERGER AGREEMENT; DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS.  Shareholder has received and
           carefully reviewed copies of the Transaction Agreements (including
           the Escrow Agreement), together with all exhibits and schedules
           thereto, and has had the opportunity to discuss such Agreements with
           counsel and other advisors.

       (g) WAIVER OF CERTAIN CLAIMS.  At the Effective Date of the Merger,
           Shareholder waives any and all claims, demands, damages, actions,
           causes of action, suits or proceedings, fixed or contingent, matured
           or unmatured, of whatever nature, character, type of description that
           have been or in the future might be asserted by Shareholder (or by
           any other person as successor to Shareholder) against Ezlogin or
           against 724 Solutions or Merger Sub, or any of their respective
           predecessors, successors or assigns, any past or present, direct or
           indirect, partner, subsidiary, or affiliated entity or corporation,
           or any past or present employee, agent, representative, attorney,
           officer, director or stockholder of any of them acting in its
           capacity as such an employee, agent, representative, attorney,
           officer, director or stockholder, arising out of facts or
           circumstances occurring at any time on or prior to the date hereof
           and relating to such person's ownership of Ezlogin Capital Stock or
           any rights or options to acquire Ezlogin Capital Stock (either
           beneficially or of record), or any federal, state or local law,
           statute or regulation, at law or in equity, or any act or omission on
           the part of such parties, other than matters relating to Dissenting
           Shares.

    2.  TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS.  Shareholder may not directly or indirectly
       offer, sell, assign, transfer, encumber, pledge, contract to sell, sell
       any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to
       sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise
       dispose of, any 724 Solutions Shares or any securities convertible into
       or exercisable or exchangeable for 724 Solutions Shares or publicly
       disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, assignment,
       transfer, pledge, grant or disposal ("Transfer") its 724 Solutions Shares
       received in the Merger unless the restrictions under this Section 2 have
       been released or complied with. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
       Shareholder may Transfer such 724 Solutions Shares (i) if required by
       court order or by operation of law or in connection with the settlement
       of such holder's estate, (ii) to a family member, (iii) to a trust
       controlled by or for the benefit of a Shareholder solely for tax or
       estate planning purposes, or (iv) to any corporation, partnership,
       limited liability company or other entity that, directly or indirectly,
       controls or is

                                     C-2-3
<PAGE>
       controlled by the Shareholder, provided that in each of (i), (ii),
       (iii) and (iv) transferee agrees in writing to assume all the obligations
       of Shareholder under this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements.

       (a) IPO LOCK-UP.  Until July 25, 2000, Shareholder will not (i) Transfer
           any 724 Solutions Shares or any securities convertible into or
           exercisable or exchangeable for 724 Solutions Shares; (ii) exercise
           any and all rights to request or demand registration pursuant to the
           Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of the 724 Solutions Shares; or
           (iii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that Transfers to
           another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of
           ownership of the 724 Solutions Shares, whether any such transaction
           described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above is to be settled by
           delivery of 724 Solutions Shares, such other securities, in cash or
           otherwise. None of the above provisions shall be deemed to prohibit
           the Shareholder from exercising an option or a warrant to purchase
           724 Solutions Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until July 25,
           2000, the Shareholder shall be permitted to Transfer
           (i) 724 Solutions Shares or securities convertible into or
           exercisable or exchangeable for 724 Solutions Shares in a gratuitous
           Transfer (including a Transfer into a Registered Retirement Savings
           Plan) so long as the recipient of such securities executes a written
           agreement stating that such recipient will be bound by the provisions
           of this Agreement and (ii) shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock
           purchased on or after the date hereof in the open market. In
           addition, if the Shareholder is a corporation, partnership, limited
           liability company or other entity, the Shareholder shall be permitted
           during the period set forth above to Transfer such securities to any
           entity that controls the Shareholder, that is controlled by the
           Shareholder, or that is under common control with the Shareholder, so
           long as the recipient of such securities executes a written agreement
           stating that it will be bound by the provisions of this Agreement
           (the "IPO Lock-Up"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the IPO Lock-Up
           shall be of no further force and effect if Credit Suisse First Boston
           Corporation ("CSFB") shall have consented to at least 20% of the
           shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock subject to the lock-up agreement
           among CSFB and the holders of shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock in
           connection with 724 Solutions' initial public offering (the "Lock-Up
           Agreement") taking any action otherwise prohibited thereby. The
           foregoing release from the IPO-Lockup shall not apply to a secondary
           offering of 724 Solutions Common Stock.

       (b) COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.  Shareholder will observe and comply with the
           Securities Act and the General Rules and Regulations thereunder, as
           now in effect and as from time to time amended and including those
           hereafter enacted or promulgated, in connection with any Transfer of
           the 724 Solutions Shares or any part thereof.

       (c) AUTHORIZATION.  To the consistent with this Agreement, Shareholder
           authorizes 724 Solutions to cause 724 Solutions' transfer agent to
           decline Transfer and/or to note stop-transfer restrictions on the
           transfer books and records of 724 Solutions with respect to any
           724 Solutions Shares received by the Shareholder pursuant to the
           Merger and, in the case of any such shares for which Shareholder is
           the beneficial owner but not the record holder, agrees to cause the
           record holder to authorize 724 Solutions to cause the transfer agent
           to decline to Transfer and/or to note stop-transfer restrictions on
           such books and records with respect to such shares.

    3.  ADDITIONAL COVENANTS.

       (a) OBLIGATIONS; INDEMNIFICATION.  Shareholder will perform all of the
           obligations of the "Shareholders" described in the Merger Agreement
           and the other Transaction Agreements, including without limitation
           the Escrow Agreement and the obligation to indemnify 724 Solutions
           Indemnitees and the Shareholder Agent as provided in Article VIII of
           the Merger Agreement.

           Shareholder may have of first refusal, rights of co-sale,
           registration rights, information rights, preemptive rights, rights of
           redemption or repurchase, board observer rights and similar rights of
           Shareholder under any agreement, arrangement or understanding
           applicable to the Ezlogin Shares as the same may apply to the
           execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the consummation
           of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
           Agreement.

       (c) LEGEND.  All certificates representing the 724 Solutions Shares
           deliverable to Shareholder pursuant to the Merger Agreement and any
           certificates subsequently issued with respect thereto or in
           substitution therefor, shall bear a legend substantially as set forth
           in Section 1.11 of the Merger Agreement.

    4.  SHAREHOLDER AGENT.

       (a) Shareholder irrevocably authorizes, directs and appoints Alexandre
           Balkanski (the "Shareholder Agent") to act as the sole and exclusive
           agent, attorney-in-fact and representative of Shareholder and
           Shareholder's heirs, representatives and successors in connection
           with the Merger Agreement, as provided in Article VIII of the Merger
           Agreement.

       (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to the
           matters covered by or related to Article VIII of the Merger Agreement
           and the Escrow Agreement:

            (i) Shareholder irrevocably relinquishes his or her right to act
                independently and other than through the Shareholder Agent with
                respect to such subject matter (except with respect to
                appointment of a successor Shareholder Agent), and

            (ii) Shareholder shall not have any right to institute any suit,
                 action or proceeding against Ezlogin, 724 Solutions or the
                 Escrow Agent with respect to any such matter, any such right
                 being irrevocably and exclusively delegated to the Shareholder
                 Agent.

           (iii) Shareholder agrees that any notice delivered to 724 Solutions
                 or a 724 Solutions Indemnified Person by Shareholder other than
                 through the Shareholder Agent shall be of no effect, and each
                 notice delivered by 724 Solutions or any other 724 Solutions
                 Indemnified Person to the Shareholder Agent shall be effective
                 as against Shareholder; provided that 724 Solutions and the
                 other 724 Solutions Indemnified Persons may elect at their sole
                 discretion to give effect to any notice delivered by
                 Shareholder.

       (c) In the event of the death, physical or mental incapacity or
           resignation of the Shareholder Agent, Shareholder shall promptly (and
           in any event within thirty (30) days of notice of such event) appoint
           a successor Shareholder Agent.

    5.  MISCELLANEOUS.

       (a) AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION.  This Agreement may not be modified,
           amended, altered or supplemented except by the execution and delivery

           of this Agreement, to be successors, assigns, transferees and
           personal representatives of the respective parties hereto. If any
           transferee of any Shareholder shall acquire 724 Solutions Shares, in
           any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such
           724 Solutions Shares shall be held subject to all of the terms of
           this Agreement, and by taking and holding such 724 Solutions Shares

           and such person shall be entitled to receive the benefits hereof.

           incurred by the prevailing party, including, without limitation, all
           reasonable attorneys' and experts' fees.

       (d) COUNTERPART EXECUTION; FACSIMILE DELIVERY.  This Agreement may be
           executed in several counterparts and delivered by facsimile, each of
           which shall be an original, but all of which together shall
           constitute one and the same agreement.

           interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of

           jurisdiction and such process. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
           THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
           RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS OR

       (j) SEVERABILITY.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
           unenforceable for any reason, such provision and all other related
           provisions shall be modified rather than voided, if possible, in
           order to achieve the intent of the parties to this Agreement to the
           extent possible. In any event, all other unrelated provisions of this
           Agreement shall be deemed valid and enforceable to the full extent.

       (k) SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.  The parties hereto
           acknowledge that 724 Solutions will be irreparably harmed and that
           there will be no adequate remedy at law for a violation of any of the
           covenants or agreements of Shareholder set forth herein. Therefore,
           it is agreed that, in addition to any other remedies that may be
           available to 724 Solutions upon any such violation, 724 Solutions
           shall have the right to enforce such covenants and agreements by
           specific performance, injunctive relief or by any other means
           available to 724 Solutions at law or in equity and the Shareholder
           hereby waives any and all defenses which could exist in its favor in
           connection with such enforcement and waives any requirement for the
           security or posting of any bond in connection with such enforcement.

       (l) TERMINATION.  This Agreement may be terminated by either Shareholder
           or 724 Solutions, if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to
           June 30, 2000, or such other date, if any, as 724 Solutions and
           Shareholder shall agree upon; provided, that the party seeking to
           terminate this Agreement shall not have breached in any material
           respect its obligations under this Agreement.

                         REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

    THIS REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered into as of
            , 2000 by and between 724 Solutions Inc., a corporation amalgamated
under the laws of Ontario ("724 Solutions"), and each of the undersigned
shareholders (each, a "Shareholder") of 724 Solutions.

                                    RECITALS

    A.  This Agreement is entered into in connection with that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of March 30, 2000 (the "Merger
Agreement") among Ezlogin, 724 Solutions, Merger Sub and the Shareholders'
Agent, pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Ezlogin.
Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

    B.  Shareholder holds and/or has options to acquire shares of Ezlogin
Capital Stock.

    C.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each
outstanding share of the Ezlogin Capital Stock will be converted into the right
to receive shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock (the "724 Solutions Shares") and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares thereof.

    D.  The 724 Solutions Shares issued to the Shareholders pursuant to the
Merger will be issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act based on Section 4(2) of that Act, which requires, among other
things, certain representations and agreements to be made by Shareholder, some
of which are reflected in this Agreement.

    E.  Shareholder is entering into this Agreement as a material inducement to,
and in consideration of, 724 Solutions' willingness to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

                                   AGREEMENT

    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, representations,
warranties, covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the parties
mutually agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1
                           INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS

    1.1 REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS. SHAREHOLDER HEREBY
REPRESENTS, WARRANTS AND COVENANTS TO 724 SOLUTIONS AS FOLLOWS:

    (a) STATUS.

       Unless otherwise indicated on Schedule 1, Shareholder is an "accredited
       investor," as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D of the Securities
       Act, and, for the purpose of Section 25102(f) of the California
       Corporations Code, he or she is excluded from the count of "purchasers"
       pursuant to Rule 260.102.13 thereunder.

       If Shareholder is not an "accredited investor", then such Shareholder,
       either alone or through appropriate representation by a "purchaser
       representative" (as such terms used in the Securities Act and the rules
       promulgated thereunder), has such knowledge and experience in financial
       and business matters that such Shareholder is capable of evaluating the
       merits and risks of the prospective investment in the 724 Solutions
       Common Stock; provided that the execution and delivery of this Agreement
       with no exceptions to the representations and warranties and a customary
       investor questionnaire, with reasonably acceptable answers thereon, shall
       be deemed to satisfy this condition; but provided further, that
       notwithstanding the above, in the event 724 Solutions has a reasonable
       belief that any relevant representation or the questionnaire is
       materially untrue or contains a material misstatement of fact, 724
       Solutions may demand additional reasonable evidence from such Shareholder
       as to such Shareholders' investor status.

                                      D-1
<PAGE>
       The address listed below the signature of Shareholder is the principal
       residence of Shareholder. If Shareholder is not an accredited investor,
       Shareholder has indicated on Schedule 1 the name of any relative, spouse
       or relative of spouse of Shareholder who has the same principal residence
       as Shareholder and who is an accredited investor. If Shareholder is an
       accredited investor, Schedule 1 also indicates the name of any
       Shareholder who is not an accredited investor and who is a relative,
       spouse or relative of spouse of Shareholder having the same principal
       residence as Shareholder.

    (b) INVESTMENT INTENT.

           (i) Shareholder is acquiring, in connection with the Merger, the 724
       Solutions Shares for investment for Shareholder's own account, not as a
       nominee or agent and not with the view to, or any intention of, a resale
       or distribution thereof, in whole or in part, or the grant of any
       participation therein, but subject nevertheless to any requirement of law
       that the disposition of his property shall at all times be within his
       control.

           (ii) Shareholder understands that the 724 Solutions Shares are not
       registered under the Securities Act, on the basis that the sale provided
       for in the Merger Agreement and the issuance of securities thereunder is
       exempt from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to
       Section 4(2) thereof, and is exempt from registration under applicable
       state securities laws by reason of specific exemptions therefrom, and
       that 724 Solutions' reliance on such exemptions is predicated on each
       Shareholder's representations set forth herein. Shareholder realizes that
       the basis for these exemptions may not be present if, notwithstanding
       such representations, Shareholder has in mind merely acquiring the
       724 Solutions Shares for a fixed or determinable period in the future, or
       for a market rise, or for sale if the market does not rise. Shareholder
       does not have any such intention.

           (iii) Shareholder understands that the 724 Solutions Shares may not
       be sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of without registration under
       the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws or an
       exemption therefrom, and that, in the absence of an effective
       registration statement covering the 724 Solutions Shares or an available
       exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable
       state securities laws, the 724 Solutions Shares must be held
       indefinitely. In particular, each Shareholder is aware that the 724
       Solutions Shares may not be sold pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under
       the Securities Act unless all of the conditions of the applicable Rule is
       met. Shareholder represents that, in the absence of an effective
       registration statement covering the 724 Solutions Shares, he will sell,
       transfer, or otherwise dispose of the 724 Solutions Shares only in a
       manner consistent with his representations set forth herein and then only
       in accordance with the provisions hereof.

           (iv) Shareholder understands that 724 Solutions shall have no
       obligation, except as provided herein, to register any of the 724
       Solutions Shares under the Securities Act or any state securities laws or
       to take any action that would make available any exemption from the
       registration requirements of such laws. Shareholder hereby acknowledges
       that, because of the restrictions on transfer or assignment of the 724
       Solutions Shares, Shareholder may have to bear the economic risk of the
       investment commitment in the 724 Solutions Shares for an indefinite
       period of time. Shareholder is able, without materially impairing his
       financial condition, to hold the 724 Solutions Shares for an indefinite
       period of time.

    (c) MERGER AGREEMENT; DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS.

       Shareholder has received and carefully reviewed copies of the Merger
       Agreement and other Transaction Agreements (including the Escrow
       Agreement), together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, and has had
       the opportunity to discuss such Agreements with counsel and other
       advisors.

       Shareholder has received and carefully reviewed copies of the Rule 506
       Documents and has had the opportunity to discuss the Rule 506 Documents
       with counsel and other advisors.

       Shareholder, either alone or together with Shareholder's purchaser
       representative (as that term is used in Regulation D to the Securities
       Act ("Purchaser Representative")), has such knowledge and experience in
       financial and business matters such that Shareholder is capable of
       (1) evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in the 724
       Solutions Shares pursuant to the terms of the Merger

                                      D-2
<PAGE>
       Agreement and (2) protecting Shareholder's interests in connection
       therewith. If Shareholder has appointed a Purchaser Representative,
       Shareholder has delivered to 724 Solutions a written acknowledgement by
       Purchaser Representative of such appointment, in form and substance
       reasonably satisfactory to 724 Solutions.

       Shareholder understands that an investment in the 724 Solutions Shares is
       speculative in nature and involves substantial risks. Shareholder has
       been given the opportunity to make a thorough investigation of the
       proposed activities of 724 Solutions and has been furnished with
       materials relating to 724 Solutions and its proposed activities.
       Shareholder confirms that all documents, records and books pertaining to
       his investment in the 724 Solutions Shares and requested in writing by
       Shareholder have been made available or delivered to Shareholder.
       Shareholder has been afforded the opportunity to obtain any additional
       information deemed necessary by Shareholder to verify the accuracy of any
       representations made or information furnished to Shareholder and to ask
       questions of a person or persons acting on behalf of 724 Solutions
       concerning 724 Solutions' business and financial affairs and the terms
       and conditions of Shareholder's acquisition of the 724 Solutions Shares
       pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and all such questions have been
       answered to Shareholder's satisfaction, none of which answers are in any
       way inconsistent with any information otherwise provided to him or by or
       on behalf of 724 Solutions. Shareholder has taken full cognizance of and
       understands the risks relating to his acquisition of the 724 Solutions
       Shares. Shareholder has relied upon, and is making its decision solely
       upon, the 506 Documents.

    1.2 COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 144 AND THE SECURITIES ACT.

    (a) COMPLIANCE.  Shareholder will observe and comply with the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as now in effect and as
from time to time amended, in connection with any offer, sale, pledge, transfer
or other disposition of the 724 Solutions Shares. In furtherance of the
foregoing, and in addition to the restrictions contained in any Transaction
Agreement executed by Shareholder, Shareholder will not offer to sell, exchange,
transfer, pledge, or otherwise dispose of any of the 724 Solutions Shares unless
at such time at least one of the following is satisfied:

        (i) a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the 724
    Solutions Shares proposed to be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of,
    describing the manner and terms of the proposed sale, transfer or other
    disposition, and containing a current prospectus, shall have been filed with
    the SEC and made effective under the Securities Act;

        (ii) such transaction shall be permitted pursuant to the provisions of
    Rule 144 under the Securities Act;

        (iii) counsel representing Shareholder, satisfactory to 724 Solutions,
    shall have advised 724 Solutions in a written opinion letter reasonably
    satisfactory to 724 Solutions and its counsel, and upon which 724 Solutions
    and its counsel may rely, that no registration under the Securities Act
    would be required in connection with the proposed sale, transfer or other
    disposition; or

        (iv) an authorized representative of the SEC shall have rendered written
    advice to Shareholder (sought by Shareholder or counsel to Shareholder, with
    a copy thereof and of all other related communications delivered to 724
    Solutions) to the effect that the SEC would take no action, or that the
    staff of the SEC would not recommend that the SEC take action, with respect
    to the proposed sale, transfer or other disposition if consummated.

    (b) LEGEND.  All certificates representing the 724 Solutions Shares
deliverable to Shareholder pursuant to the Merger Agreement and any certificates
subsequently issued with respect thereto or in substitution therefor, unless a
sale, transfer or other disposition is executed pursuant to one or more of the
alternative conditions set forth in Section 1.3(a) shall have occurred, or
unless the conditions of paragraph (k) of Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act shall have been satisfied, shall bear a legend as set forth in
Section 1.11 of the Merger Agreement.

                              REGISTRATION RIGHTS

    2.1 PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

    (a) If, at any time 724 Solutions proposes to register shares of its common
stock ("724 Solutions Common Stock") under the Securities Act in connection with
any offering of 724 Solutions Common Stock (other than a registration statement
on Form S-8 or Form S-4, or their successors, or any other form for a limited
purpose or which otherwise does not include at least substantially the same
information as would be required to be included in a registration statement
covering the sale of registrable securities, or any registration statement
covering only securities proposed to be issued in exchange for securities or
assets of another entity or in a registration in which the only 724 Solutions
Common Stock being registered is 724 Solutions Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of debt securities which are also being registered), whether or not
for its own account, 724 Solutions shall furnish prompt (but in no event later
than twenty-one (21) days prior to the filing of the applicable registration
statement) written notice to Shareholder of its intention to effect such
registration and the intended method of distribution in connection therewith.
Upon the written request of Shareholder made to 724 Solutions within twenty-one
(21) days after the furnishing such notice by 724 Solutions, 724 Solutions shall
include in such registration the requested number of 724 Solutions Shares issued
pursuant to the Merger (the "Registrable Securities"), subject to the provisions
hereof and other customary terms, conditions and limitations relating to the
registration of securities generally, provided, that 724 Solutions shall not be
required to register any Registrable Securities the Transfer of which is
restricted by the terms of any other Transaction Agreement (other than the "IPO
Lock-Up" (as defined in such other Transaction Agreement), which restriction
shall be waived with respect to the shares included in any such registration).
All rights granted to Shareholder pursuant to this SECTION 2.1 shall terminate
with respect to any Registrable Securities held by Shareholder upon the earliest
to occur of (i) the time when all of the Registrable Securities may immediately
be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act within any ninety
(90) day period, (ii) upon any sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to a
registration statement or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or (iii) the date
two (2) years after the date hereof.

    (b) Nothing in this SECTION 2.1 shall create any liability on the part of
724 Solutions or any other person to Shareholder if 724 Solutions or any other
person should, for any reason, decide not to file a registration statement
proposed to be filed or to withdraw such registration statement subsequent to
its filing, regardless of any action whatsoever that Shareholder may have taken,
whether as a result of the issuance by 724 Solutions of any notice under this
Section 2.1 or otherwise.

    (c) It shall be a condition precedent to the obligation of 724 Solutions to
include any Registrable Securities in a registration statement pursuant to this
Section 2.1 that Shareholder shall furnish to 724 Solutions such information
regarding himself, the Registrable Securities held by him, and the intended
method of disposition of such securities as shall be required pursuant to the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder to effect the
registration of the Registrable Securities held by Shareholder. Any such
information, or any comments on any such information included in a draft of a
registration statement provided to Shareholder for his comment, shall be
provided to 724 Solutions within any reasonable time period requested by 724
Solutions.

    (d) 724 Solutions may suspend any applicable registration statement and
require that Shareholder immediately cease the sale of 724 Solutions Shares
pursuant to the registration statement in any period during which 724 Solutions
is engaged in any activity or transaction or preparations or negotiations for
any activity or transaction (the "724 Solutions Activity") that 724 Solutions in
good faith desires to keep confidential for business reasons, if 724 Solutions
determines in good faith (and so certifies to Shareholder) that the public
disclosure requirements imposed on 724 Solutions under the Securities Act in
connection with the registration statement would require disclosure of 724
Solutions Activity, or during which there exists any other material non-public
information relating to 724 Solutions which 724 Solutions determines in good
faith should not be disclosed; provided that (i) 724 Solutions shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the length of any such period of
suspension, and (ii) any such suspension shall be applied in the same manner to
all other security holders included in such registration statements and to any
other registration statement or proposed offering of 724 Solutions' securities
proposed or then in effect.

                                      D-4
<PAGE>
    (e) Shareholder shall notify 724 Solutions, at any time when a prospectus is
required to be delivered under applicable law, of the happening of any event as
a result of which the prospectus included in the applicable registration
statement, as then in effect, with respect to information provided or confirmed
by Shareholder, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing.
Shareholder shall immediately upon the occurrence of any such event cease using
such prospectus. If so requested by 724 Solutions, Shareholder promptly shall
return to 724 Solutions any copies of any prospectus in its possession (other
than permanent file copies) that contains an untrue statement of a material fact
or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then
existing.

    (f) 724 Solutions shall bear and pay all reasonable expenses incurred by it
in connection with any registration, filing or qualification of the Registrable
Securities pursuant to this Section 2.1, including (without limitation) all
registration, filing and qualification fees, printers' and accounting fees, fees
and disbursements of counsel for 724 Solutions, but excluding underwriting
discounts and commissions relating to the Registrable Securities. 724 Solutions
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses up to $15,000 of one counsel for all
Shareholders in connection with any registration, filing or qualification
hereunder, except to the extent mandated by applicable law, regulations,
policies or rules of governmental bodies or stock exchanges.

    (g) In connection with any underwritten offering of securities, 724
Solutions shall not be required under this SECTION 2.1 to register any of
Shareholder's Registrable Securities in connection with such underwritten
offering unless Shareholder accepts the underwriters selected by 724 Solutions
and executes an underwriting agreement with such underwriters containing such
provisions as are customary in an underwritten offering (including a market
stand-off agreement of up to 180 days if required by such underwriters) that
includes shares held by a shareholder. Registrable Securities shall be sold in
such offering only in such quantity as the lead managing underwriter determines,
in its sole discretion, will not jeopardize the success of the offering by 724
Solutions. To the extent that the lead managing underwriter advises 724
Solutions in writing that, in its opinion, the number of securities proposed to
be included in the offering exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering
without adversely affecting the price of the securities to be sold, then the
securities to be included shall be apportioned as follows: (i) first, 724
Solutions and any holders of securities of 724 Solutions exercising any demand
registration rights granted to such holders shall be entitled to register all
securities that 724 Solutions or such other holders propose to sell for their
own accounts, in such proportion as they shall agree upon; (ii) second, any
holders of 724 Solutions securities exercising piggyback registration rights as
and to the extent that such registration rights have priority over the
registration rights granted to Shareholder hereunder pursuant to agreements
entered into on or prior to the date of execution of the Merger Agreement; and
(iii) lastly, Shareholder, together with any holders of other 724 Solutions
securities exercising piggyback registration rights as and to the extent that
such registration rights rank pari passu with the piggyback registration rights
hereunder (it being understood that 724 Solutions shall not grant any piggyback
registration rights having priority over the rights granted hereunder on or
after the date of execution of the Merger Agreement), shall be entitled to
register, on a pro rata basis, up to that number of Registrable Securities and
other shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock that is equal to the remaining shares
of 724 Solutions Common Stock that the lead managing underwriter will permit to
be registered after giving effect to the apportionment set forth in clauses (i)
and (ii) above, in connection with such offering. If Shareholder disapproves of
the terms of any such underwriting, Shareholder may elect to withdraw therefrom
by written notice to 724 Solutions and the underwriter(s), delivered at least
ten (10) business days prior to the effective date of the registration
statement. Any Registrable Securities excluded or withdrawn from such
underwriting shall be excluded and withdrawn from the registration.

    (h) Whenever required to effect the registration of any Registrable
Securities under this Agreement, 724 Solutions shall:

        (i) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to
    such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such
    registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of
    the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered
    by such registration statement;

                                      D-5
<PAGE>
        (ii) Furnish to Shareholder such number of copies of a prospectus,
    including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of
    the Securities Act, and such other documents as Shareholder may reasonably
    request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities
    owned by Shareholder that are included in such registration; and

        (iii) Use its reasonable efforts to register and qualify the Registrable
    Securities covered by such registration statement under such other
    securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably
    requested by the Shareholder, provided that 724 Solutions shall not be
    required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do
    business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such
    states or jurisdictions.

    (i) Shareholder shall not have any right to obtain or seek an injunction
restraining or otherwise delaying any registration as the result of any
controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or
implementation of this Section 2.1.

    2.2 INDEMNIFICATION.

    (a) To the extent permitted by law, 724 Solutions will indemnify and hold
harmless Shareholder against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities to
which he may become subject under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or other federal or state law,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements,
omissions or violations (collectively a "Violation") by 724 Solutions: (i) any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final
prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
(iii) any violation or alleged violation by 724 Solutions of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law in
connection with the offering covered by such registration statement; and 724
Solutions will reimburse Shareholder for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by him in connection with investigating or defending any such loss,
claim, damage, liability or action; provided, that the indemnity agreement
contained in this Section 2.2(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement
of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is
effected without the consent of 724 Solutions, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, nor shall 724 Solutions be liable in any such case for
any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises
out of or is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection
with such registration by Shareholder.

    (b) To the extent permitted by law, Shareholder will, if the 724 Solutions
Shares held by Shareholder are included in the securities as to which such
registration, qualification or compliance is being effected, indemnify and hold
harmless 724 Solutions, each of its directors and officers, its legal counsel,

was timely furnished to the indemnified party and was not furnished to the
person asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the time
such action is required by the Securities Act.

                                ESCROW AGREEMENT

    THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (the "Escrow Agreement") is entered into this
June 15, 2000 by and among 724 Solutions Inc., a corporation amalgamated under
the laws of Ontario ("724 Solutions"), U.S. Bank Trust, National Association
(the "Escrow Agent), and Alexandre Balkanski, as representative (the
"Shareholders' Agent") for the shareholders and optionholders of Ezlogin (as
defined below).

                                    RECITALS

    A. This Agreement is entered into in connection with the First Amended and
Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the "Merger
Agreement"), dated as of May 9, 2000 and entered into by and among 724
Solutions, Ezlogin.com, Inc. ("Ezlogin"), Merger Sub and the Shareholders'
Agent, pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Ezlogin.
Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

    B.  Sections 1.7(d), 5.12 and 8.1 of the Merger Agreement provide that
(i) an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the shares of 724 Solutions Common
Stock issued in the Merger in respect of Ezlogin Capital Stock outstanding at
the Effective Time, and (ii) if 724 Solutions assumes the Ezlogin Options in
connection with the Merger, any Subject Shares (as defined below) will be held
in escrow to compensate 724 Solutions for certain indemnification obligations of
the Shareholders of Ezlogin.

    In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.  Deposit of Property.

        (a) Escrow Shares.  Pursuant to Section 1.7(d)(ii) of the Merger
    Agreement, as soon as reasonably practicable but not later than five days,
    after the Effective Date, 724 Solutions will distribute to the Escrow Agent
    a certificate or certificates for One Hundred Thousand Three Hundred
    Sixty-One and Twelve Hundredth (100,361.12) shares of 724 Solutions Common
    Stock (the "Escrow Shares") shares representing ten (10%) of the shares of
    724 Solutions Common Stock issued in the Merger in respect of Ezlogin
    Capital Stock outstanding at the Effective Time, at the following address:

       U.S. Bank Trust N.A.
       One California Street, Suite 2550
       San Francisco, CA 94111
       Account No.: 94416760
       Reference: 724 Solutions/Ezlogin
       Attn: Ann Gadsby

    The Escrow Shares shall be registered in the name of the Escrow Agent as
    nominee for the beneficial owners of such shares. The number of Escrow
    Shares beneficially owned by each Shareholder, the percentage interest of
    each Shareholder in the Escrow Fund and the address of each Shareholder are
    set forth in Schedule 1 attached hereto.

        (b) Subject Shares.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, if 724 Solutions
    assumes Ezlogin's Stock Option Plan and the outstanding Ezlogin Options, ten
    percent (10%) of the options to purchase 724 Solutions Common Stock
    resulting from the assumption of Ezlogin Options in connection with the
    Merger (the "Subject Options") shall be subject to cancellation as security
    for the Optionholders' indemnification obligations under the Merger
    Agreement. However, to the extent that an Optionholder exercises a Subject
    Option prior to the termination of the Escrow Period (or after the Escrow
    Period, if such Subject Option has been subject to cancellation to satisfy
    any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers' Certificate delivered to
    the Escrow Agent and the Shareholders' Agent prior to the termination of the
    Escrow Period with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to the
    expiration of the Escrow Period and until such claims have been resolved),
    724 Solutions shall distribute to the Escrow Agent, at the address set forth
    in Section 1(a) above and as soon as reasonably practical after the exercise
    of such Subject Option, a certificate or certificates representing the
    resulting shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock, subject to and in

                                      E-1
<PAGE>
    accordance with the provisions of Article VIII of the Merger Agreement (the
    "Subject Shares"). The Subject Shares shall be registered in the name of the
    Escrow Agent as nominee for the Optionholder and shall constitute Escrow
    Shares in all respects hereunder and under the Merger Agreement. As soon as
    reasonably possible after any delivery of Subject Shares to the Escrow
    Agent, 724 Solutions and the Shareholders' Agent will deliver to the Escrow
    Agent a new Schedule 1 to this Agreement, reflecting the additional Escrow
    Shares and the change in each Shareholder's pro rata portion of the Escrow
    Fund.

2.  Holding in Escrow; Earnings on Escrow Shares; Voting of 724 Solutions Common
    Stock.

        (a) Escrow Agent agrees to hold in escrow the Escrow Shares and any
    additional monies which may be delivered to it (the "Escrow Fund"), subject
    to the terms and conditions of this Escrow Agreement, shall treat such
    Escrow Fund as a trust fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
    and the Merger Agreement and not as the property of the 724 Solutions, and
    shall dispose of the Escrow Shares only in accordance with the terms hereof.

        (b) All dividends payable on the Escrow Shares held by Escrow Agent
    shall be paid or made to the Ezlogin Shareholders, by check mailed via first
    class mail, to the Shareholders at their addresses, and in the percentage
    interests, set forth in Schedule 1 attached hereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
    any dividend or other distribution payable ratably to all holders of 724
    Solutions Common Stock in the form of additional shares of 724 Solutions
    Common Stock, or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or
    indirectly, additional shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock, and any
    securities issued in exchange for 724 Solutions Common Stock, shall remain
    part of the Escrow Fund and shall not be paid to the Ezlogin Shareholders
    except pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 of this Escrow Agreement.

        (c) Each of the Shareholders of Ezlogin shall have the power to vote
    such Shareholder's share of the 724 Solutions Common Stock remaining in the
    Escrow Fund at any time, provided that each Shareholder shall not exercise
    voting power over any shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock that are
    distributed to 724 Solutions under SECTION 3 OR 5 hereof. The Escrow Shares
    shall be voted by the Escrow Agent, as record holder, in accordance with the
    instructions received by the Escrow Agent from the beneficial owners of such
    shares. In the absence of such instructions, the Escrow Agent shall be under
    no obligation to vote such shares.

3.  Payment for 724 Solutions Damages.

        (a) Upon 724 Solutions' delivery of an Officer's Certificate or
    Certificates identifying 724 Solutions Damages to the Escrow Agent as
    provided in SECTION 5 below and the determination that such amount is
    payable pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, 724 Solutions shall receive
    Escrow Shares from the Escrow Fund equal in value to the Shareholders' pro
    rata portion of the of 724 Solutions Damages (such Shareholders' pro rata
    amount to be specified in the Officers' Certificate); provided, however,
    that in no event shall 724 Solutions receive more than the number of shares
    of 724 Solutions Common Stock originally placed in the Escrow Fund or added
    to the Escrow Fund upon the exercise of any Subject Options. Payment of 724
    Solutions Damages shall be taken ratably from Escrow Shares and, if
    applicable, the cancellation of Subject Options by 724 Solutions with such
    Optionholder's vested and unvested Subject Options being cancelled ratably
    (including with respect to vesting dates). 724 Solutions shall receive
    Escrow Shares ratably from Shareholders' Escrow Shares not subject to an
    Unvested Share Repurchase Option, as defined in Section 5.2(c) of the Merger
    Agreement and as set forth on Schedule 1, and from Escrow Shares subject to
    an Unvested Share Repurchase Option (including with respect to lapsing
    dates).

        (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Shareholders'
    and Optionholders' total indemnification obligations pursuant to
    Article VIII of the Merger Agreement shall not exceed 10% of the Merger
    Consideration (the "Indemnification Cap") valued at the 724 Solutions Stock
    Price, and no Shareholder or Optionholder shall have liability for any 724
    Solutions Damages unless and until Officer's Certificates (as defined in
    SECTION 5 below) identifying aggregate 724 Solutions Damages in excess of
    $375,000 (the "Indemnification Threshold") have been received by the Escrow
    Agent, in which case 724 Solutions shall be entitled to recover all 724
    Solutions Damages; provided that all 724 Solutions Damages relating to the
    representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.2 and 2.38 of the
    Merger Agreement

                                      E-2
<PAGE>
    (collectively, the "Excluded Damages") shall not be subject to either the
    Indemnification Cap or the Indemnification Threshold.

4.  Escrow Period.

        (a) The escrow shall terminate on the one year anniversary of the
    Effective Time ("Escrow Period"); provided, however, that a portion of the
    Escrow Shares, which is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims
    specified in any Officer's Certificate theretofore delivered to the Escrow
    Agent prior to termination of the Escrow Period with respect to facts and
    circumstances existing prior to expiration of the Escrow Period, shall
    remain in the Escrow Fund until such claims have been resolved. 724
    Solutions shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate specifying the
    Effective Time.

        (b) If 724 Solutions assumes the Ezlogin Options in connection with the
    Merger, 724 Solutions shall hold the Subject Options as security for the
    Optionholders' indemnity obligations under the Merger Agreement for the
    entire Escrow Period (unless such Subject Option is exercised, in which case
    the Subject Shares issuable upon exercise thereof shall be delivered to the
    Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms hereof); provided, however, that a
    portion of the Subject Options which is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied
    claims specified in any Officer's Certificate theretofore delivered to the
    Escrow Agent and the Shareholders' Agent prior to termination of the Escrow
    Period with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to expiration
    of the Escrow Period and until such claims have been resolved, shall remain
    subject to cancellation and subject to the provisions of Article VIII of the
    Merger Agreement until such claims have been resolved.

        (c) Any amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund after the Escrow Period
    that are not in dispute relating to the indemnification obligations of the
    Shareholders arising under the Merger Agreement and this Escrow Agreement
    shall be promptly distributed to the Shareholders (including Shareholders of
    Subject Shares) and any Subject Options then outstanding that are not in
    dispute relating to the indemnification obligations of the Optionholders
    arising under the Merger Agreement shall be promptly released to the
    Optionholders. As soon as all such disputed claims have been resolved, the
    Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Shareholders all of the Escrow Shares and
    other property remaining in the Escrow Fund and not required to satisfy such
    claims and expenses. Each Shareholder shall receive that number of Escrow
    Shares equivalent to such Shareholder's percentage interest in the Escrow
    Fund as set forth in SCHEDULE 1 attached hereto.

5.  Claims upon Escrow Fund.

        (a) In order to receive Escrow Shares or cancel Subject Options as
    compensation for 724 Solutions Damages, 724 Solutions must first deliver to
    the Escrow Agent and the Shareholders' Agent, on or before the last day of
    the Escrow Period, a certificate signed by any officer of 724 Solutions (an
    "Officer's Certificate"), stating that 724 Solutions Damages exist and
    specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of such 724 Solutions
    Damages included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid,
    or properly accrued in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or arose, and the nature
    of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or claim to which such item is
    related and the specific representation, warranty or covenant alleged to
    have been the subject of such misrepresentation, breach or default. The
    Officer's Certificate shall also specify the amount of Escrow Shares and
    identify the category of shares to be delivered (as set forth in
    Section 3(a)) to 724 Solutions out of the Escrow Fund and, if applicable,
    the number and identity of Subject Options, if any, which shall be cancelled
    if the claim represented in the Officer's Certificate were to be paid. Upon
    receipt of the Officer's Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the
    provisions of SECTIONS 6 AND 7 below, deliver to 724 Solutions out of the
    Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, 724 Solutions Common Stock or other
    assets held in the Escrow Fund, having a value equal to the portion of such
    724 Solutions Damages attributable to the indemnity obligations of the
    Shareholders as specified in the Officer's Certificate.

        (b) For the purpose of compensating 724 Solutions for its 724 Solutions
    Damages pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Shares, and, if applicable,
    the Subject Options, shall be valued at the 724 Solutions Stock Price. 724
    Solutions shall set forth the 724 Solutions Stock Price in a certificate
    delivered to the Escrow Agent. If the value to be distributed to 724
    Solutions with respect to each Shareholder or

                                      E-3
<PAGE>
    Optionholder is not evenly divisible by the 724 Solutions Stock Price, the
    Escrow Agent shall round down the number of shares to be distributed to the
    next highest number of shares and shall distribute that number to 724
    Solutions. The fractional interests remaining will be aggregated with future
    claims against the Escrow Fund and Subject Options and will be delivered to
    724 Solutions or cancelled when any fractional shares in the aggregate are
    equal to a whole number of shares or options. Upon the release of the Escrow
    Fund, 724 Solution may direct the Escrow Agent to distribute the fractional
    interests to the Shareholders and Optionholders or to monetize such
    fractional interests in exchange for a pro rata payment of the 724 Solutions
    Stock Price, to be paid as provided with respect to fractional shares in the
    manner set forth in Section 1.6(c) of the Merger Agreement.

        (c) In lieu of the fractional interest not distributed, 724 Solutions
    shall furnish to the Escrow Agent cash equal to such fractional interest
    times the 724 Solutions Stock Price, and the Escrow Agent in turn will
    distribute to 724 Solutions a whole share of 724 Solutions Common Stock.
    Accordingly, the Escrow Agent, upon receipt of such funds, shall deliver the
    corresponding number of shares to 724 Solutions. In all events, 724
    Solutions shall so purchase only a whole number of shares. Any cash so
    received from 724 Solutions and not so immediately distributed by the Escrow
    Agent shall be retained by the Escrow Agent as part of the Escrow Fund, but
    need not be invested.

6.  Objections to Claims.  At the time of delivery of any Officer's Certificate
    to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such Officer's Certificate shall be
    delivered to the Shareholders' Agent and, for a period of forty-five
    (45) days after such delivery to the Escrow Agent of such Officer's
    Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery of 724 Solutions Common
    Stock or other property pursuant to Section 5 hereof unless the Escrow Agent
    shall have received written authorization from the Shareholders' Agent to
    make such delivery. After the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period,
    the Escrow Agent shall make delivery of the 724 Solutions Common Stock or
    other property in the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 5 hereof,
    provided that no such payment or delivery may be made if the Shareholders'
    Agent shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officer's
    Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow
    Agent and to 724 Solutions prior to the expiration of such forty-five
    (45) day period.

7.  Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.

        (a) In case the Shareholders' Agent shall so object in writing to any
    claim or claims by 724 Solutions made in any Officer's Certificate, 724
    Solutions shall have forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Escrow Agent
    and 724 Solutions of an objection by the Shareholders' Agent to respond in a
    written statement to the objection of the Shareholders' Agent. If after such
    forty-five (45) day period there remains a dispute as to any claims, the
    Shareholders' Agent and 724 Solutions shall attempt in good faith for sixty
    (60) days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to
    each of such claims. If the Shareholders' Agent and 724 Solutions should so
    agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and
    signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The
    Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall
    distribute the 724 Solutions Common Stock or other property from the Escrow
    Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.

        (b) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation,
    either 724 Solutions or the Shareholders' Agent may, by written notice to
    the other, demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage
    or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event
    arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both
    parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be
    settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Within fifteen
    (15) days after such written notice is sent, 724 Solutions and the
    Shareholders' Agent shall each select one arbitrator, and the two
    arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The decision of the
    arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's
    Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this
    Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in SECTION 6 hereof, the Escrow
    Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or
    withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.

        (c) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered
    in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in
    Santa Clara County, California under the commercial

                                      E-4
<PAGE>
    rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. For purposes
    of this SECTION 7(C), in any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the
    amount thereof stated in the Officer's Certificate is at issue, 724
    Solutions shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party unless the
    arbitrators award 724 Solutions more than one-half ( 1/2) of the amount in
    dispute, plus any amounts not in dispute; otherwise, the Shareholders and
    Optionholders for whom shares of 724 Solutions Common Stock otherwise
    issuable to them have been deposited in the Escrow Fund, or who hold Subject
    Options, as applicable, shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party. The
    Non-Prevailing Party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees
    of each arbitrator, the administrative fee of the American Arbitration
    Association, and the expenses, including without limitation, attorneys' fees
    and costs, reasonably incurred by the other party to the arbitration. If the
    Shareholders and the Optionholders are deemed to be the Non-Prevailing
    Party, such expenses and fees shall be paid first, from the Escrow Shares
    and the cancellation of Subject Options, and second, by 724 Solutions,
    provided that the Shareholders and Optionholders shall be and remain liable
    to 724 Solutions for the amount that the total of all such fees and expenses
    exceeds the total Escrow Shares and Subject Options, valued at the 724
    Solutions Stock Price (the "Excess Fees"), and the Shareholders and
    Optionholders, severally, hereby indemnify and hold harmless the 724
    Solutions Indemnified Persons from and against all such Excess Fees.

8.  Shareholders' Agent.

        (a) By executing an Employee Holders' Agreement or Non-Employee
    Shareholders' Agreement, voting to approve the Merger or accepting any
    Merger Consideration, each Shareholder and Optionholder appoints Alexandre
    Balkanski as agent (the "Shareholders' Agent") for and on behalf of such
    Shareholder and Optionholder to give and receive notices and communications,
    to authorize delivery to 724 Solutions of the 724 Solutions Common Stock or
    other property from the Escrow Fund and, if applicable, the cancellation of
    Subject Options, in satisfaction of claims by 724 Solutions, to object to
    such deliveries and cancellations, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
    settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with
    orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and
    to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
    Shareholders' Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may
    be changed by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund and
    the Subject Options from time to time upon not less than ten (10) days'
    prior written notice to 724 Solutions. No bond shall be required of the
    Shareholders' Agent, and the Shareholders' Agent shall receive no
    compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or from the
    Shareholders' Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the Ezlogin
    Shareholders and Optionholders.

        (b) The Shareholders' Agent shall not be liable for any act done or
    omitted hereunder as Shareholders' Agent while acting in good faith and in
    the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to
    the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The
    Ezlogin Shareholders and Optionholders shall severally indemnify the
    Shareholders' Agent and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or
    expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
    Shareholders' Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
    or administration of his duties hereunder.

        (c) The Shareholders' Agent shall have reasonable access to information
    about Ezlogin, the Surviving Corporation and 724 Solutions and the
    reasonable assistance of Ezlogin's, the Surviving Corporation's and 724
    Solutions' respective officers and employees for purposes of performing its
    duties and exercising its rights hereunder, provided that the Shareholders'
    Agent shall treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information
    from or about Ezlogin, the Surviving Corporation or 724 Solutions to anyone
    (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such
    information confidentially).

        (d) Alexandre Balkanski hereby agrees to act as the Shareholders' Agent
    pursuant to the terms hereof.

9.  Actions of the Shareholders' Agent.  A decision, act, consent or instruction
    of the Shareholders' Agent shall constitute a decision of all Shareholders
    with an interest in the Escrow Fund and all Optionholders holding Subject
    Options and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such
    Shareholder and Optionholder, and the Escrow Agent and 724 Solutions may
    rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders'
    Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every

                                      E-5
<PAGE>
    such Shareholder and Optionholder. The Escrow Agent, 724 Solutions, Ezlogin
    and the Surviving Corporation are hereby relieved from any liability to any
    person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
    consent or instruction of the Shareholders' Agent.

10. Third-Party Claims.  In the event 724 Solutions becomes aware of a
    third-party claim which 724 Solutions believes may result in a demand
    against the Escrow Fund or the Subject Options, 724 Solutions shall promptly
    notify the Shareholders' Agent of such claim, and the Shareholders' Agent,
    on behalf of the Shareholders and the Optionholders, shall be entitled, at
    the Shareholders' and Optionholders' expense, to participate in any defense
    of such claim. 724 Solutions shall have the right in its sole discretion to
    settle any such claim; provided, however, that 724 Solutions may not effect
    the settlement of any such claim without the consent of the Shareholders'
    Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event that
    the Shareholders' Agent has consented to any such settlement, the
    Shareholders' Agent shall have no power or authority to object under
    Section 6 or any other provision of Article VIII of the Merger Agreement to
    the amount of any claim by 724 Solutions against the Escrow Fund or the
    Subject Options for indemnity with respect to such settlement.

11. Fees and Expenses.  724 Solutions shall pay Escrow Agent compensation, as
    payment in full for the services to be rendered by Escrow Agent hereunder
    per the Fee Schedule as attached as Schedule 2 hereto. Any such
    reimbursement to which Escrow Agent is entitled shall be borne by 724
    Solutions. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed upon for
    services of Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for ordinary
    services as contemplated by this Escrow Agreement. In the event that the
    conditions of this Escrow Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if Escrow
    Agent renders any service not provided for in this Escrow Agreement, or if
    the parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if any
    controversy arises, or if Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in,
    any litigation pertaining to this escrow or its subject matter, Escrow Agent
    shall be reasonably compensated by 724 Solutions for such extraordinary
    services and reimbursed for all costs, attorney's fees, including allocated
    costs of in-house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay,
    controversy or litigation (collectively, "Extraordinary Expenses") and
    Escrow Agent shall have the right to retain all documents and/or other
    things of value at any time held by Escrow Agent in this escrow (other than
    the Escrow Funds) until such compensation, fees, costs, and expenses are
    paid.

12. Limitation on Escrow Agent's Liability.  The Escrow Agent's responsibilities
    and liabilities shall be limited as follows:

        (a) The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for or be required to
    enforce any of the terms or conditions of the Merger Agreement or any other
    agreement between the parties thereto. The Escrow Agent shall not be
    responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for the performance by the
    Shareholders' Agent or 724 Solutions of their respective obligations under
    the Merger Agreement or this Escrow Agreement, nor shall the Escrow Agent be
    responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for the failure of any other
    party to the Merger Agreement to honor any of the provisions of the Merger
    Agreement.

        (b) The duties and obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be limited to
    and determined solely by the express provisions of this Escrow Agreement and
    no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Escrow Agreement
    against the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent is not bound by and is under no
    duty to inquire into the terms or validity of any other agreements or
    documents, including any agreements which may be related to, referred to in
    or deposited with the Escrow Agent in connection with this Escrow Agreement.

        (c) The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon and shall be
    protected in acting in reliance upon any instruction, notice, information,
    certificate, instrument or other document which is submitted to it in
    connection with its duties under this Escrow Agreement and which the Escrow
    Agent in good faith believes to have been signed or presented by the proper
    party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability with respect to
    the form, execution, validity or authenticity thereof.

        (d) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act which the Escrow
    Agent may do or omit to do hereunder, or for any mistake of fact or law, or
    for any error of judgment, or for the misconduct of any

                                      E-6
<PAGE>
    employee, agent or attorney appointed by it, while acting in good faith,
    unless caused by or arising from its own gross negligence or willful
    misconduct.

        (e) The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to consult with counsel of its
    own selection and the opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete
    authorization and protection to the Escrow Agent in respect of any action
    taken or omitted by the Escrow Agent hereunder in good faith and in
    accordance with the opinion of such counsel.

        (f) The Escrow Agent shall have the right at any time to resign for any
    reason and be discharged of its duties as Escrow Agent hereunder by giving
    written notice of its resignation to the parties hereto at least thirty
    (30) calendar days prior to the date specified for such resignation to take
    effect. In addition, 724 Solutions and the Shareholders' Agent may jointly
    remove the Escrow Agent as escrow agent at any time with or without cause,
    by an instrument (which may be executed in counterparts) given to the Escrow
    Agent, which instrument shall designate the effective date of such removal.
    In the event of any such resignation or removal, a successor escrow agent
    which shall be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the
    United States of America or of the State of California having (or if such
    bank or trust company is a member of a bank company, its bank holding
    company has) a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000,
    shall be appointed by 724 Solutions with the approval of the Shareholders'
    Agent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any such successor
    escrow agent shall deliver to 724 Solutions and the Shareholders' Agent a
    written instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon it shall
    succeed to all the rights and duties of the escrow agent hereunder and shall
    be entitled to receive the Escrow Fund. All obligations of the Escrow Agent
    hereunder shall cease and terminate on the effective date of its resignation
    or removal and its sole responsibility thereafter shall be to hold the
    Escrow Fund, for a period of thirty (30) calendar days following the
    effective date of resignation or removal, at which time,

           (1) if a successor Escrow Agent shall have been appointed and written
       notice thereof shall have been given to the resigning or removed Escrow
       Agent by parties hereto and the successor Escrow Agent, then the
       resigning Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining Escrow Funds to the
       successor Escrow Agent; or

           (2) if a successor Escrow Agent shall not have been appointed, for
       any reason whatsoever, the resigning or removed Escrow Agent shall
       deliver the Escrow Funds to a court of competent jurisdiction in the
       county in which the Escrow Funds are then being held and give written
       notice of the same to 724 Solutions and the Shareholders' Agent.

           (3) The resigning or removed Escrow Agent shall be reimbursed by 724
       Solutions for any reasonable expenses incurred in connection with its
       resignation and transfer of the Escrow Funds pursuant to and in
       accordance with the provisions of this SECTION 12.

        (g) 724 Solutions agrees to indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent harmless
    from and against any and all liabilities, causes of action, claims, demands,
    judgments, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
    and expenses) that may arise out of or in connection with the Escrow Agent's
    good faith acceptance of and performance of its duties and obligations under
    this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to institute
    any suit, or to take any remedial procedures under this Escrow Agreement, or
    to enter any appearance or in any way defend any suit in which it may be
    made a defendant hereunder until it shall be indemnified as provided above.

        (h) In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its
    duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions with respect to the
    Escrow Funds which, in its sole discretion, are in conflict either with
    other instructions received by it or with any provision of this Escrow
    Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall have the absolute right to suspend all
    further performance under this Escrow Agreement (except for the safekeeping
    of the Escrow Funds) until such uncertainty or conflicting instructions have
    been resolved by alternative dispute resolution, to the Escrow Agent's sole
    satisfaction, pursuant to SECTION 7 hereof or by final judgment of a court
    of competent jurisdiction, joint written instructions from all of the other
    parties hereto, or otherwise. In the event that any controversy arises
    between one or more of the parties hereto or any other party with respect to
    this Escrow Agreement or the Escrow Funds, the Escrow Agent shall not be
    required to determine the proper resolution of such controversy or the
    proper disposition of the Escrow

                                      E-7
<PAGE>
    Funds and shall have the absolute right, in its sole discretion, to deposit
    the Escrow Funds with the clerk of a court of competent jurisdiction
    specified in SECTION 7 hereof, file a suit in interpleader in that court and
    obtain an order from that court requiring all parties involved to resolve
    their respective claims to the Escrow Funds pursuant to SECTION 7 or to
    litigate their respective claims arising out of or in connection with the
    Escrow Funds in that court. Upon the deposit by the Escrow Agent of the
    Escrow Funds with the clerk of that court in accordance with this provision,
    the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of all further obligations and released
    from all liability hereunder.

13. Notices.  Unless otherwise agreed, all notices, instructions and other
    communications required or permitted to be given hereunder or necessary or
