(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Delaware Merger Effective Time, Delaware Merger Sub will be merged
with and into the Company, and the separate existence of Delaware Merger Sub

the fifth Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be
satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 7_ (other than those conditions set forth in _Sections_
___6.6_ and _7.6_ , which are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions), or at such other
place, time or date as the Principal Parties may jointly designate.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _
1.3_, if the Closing would otherwise be required to occur under this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.3_ during the last seven days of any fiscal quarter of
Marvell, then, subject to the continued satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in ___Section_ __ _ 6_ and  _Section_ __ _ 7_ (other
than those conditions set forth in _Sections_ _6.6_ and _7.6_ , which are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each
of such conditions), the Closing shall occur instead on the earlier of (a) __
the second Business Day of the following fiscal quarter of Marvell and (b) __
the End Date, unless the Principal Parties jointly designate another date. The
date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the "

be included in the Bermuda Merger Application a request that the Registrar
issue the certificate of merger with respect to the Bermuda Merger (the "
_Bermuda Merger Certificate_ ") on the Closing Date at the time designated by
Marvell and set forth in the Bermuda Merger Application. The Bermuda Merger
shall become effective on the issuance of the Bermuda Merger Certificate by
the Registrar at the time and date shown on the Bermuda Merger Certificate
(the time at which the Bermuda Merger becomes effective being referred to as
the " _Bermuda Merger Effective Time_ ").

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger
satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL and specifying that the

Date, filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The
Delaware Merger will become effective as of the time specified in such

or a record date with respect to any such event occurs during the Pre-Closing
Period, then the Per Share Cash Amount and the Exchange Ratio will be
adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. If, during the Pre-
Closing Period, the issued and outstanding Marvell Common Shares or the
outstanding shares of HoldCo Common Stock are changed into a different number
or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if a stock
dividend is declared by Marvell or HoldCo during the Pre-Closing Period, or a
record date with respect to any such event occurs during the Pre-Closing
Period, then the Exchange Ratio (but not the Per Share Cash Amount) and the
consideration payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)(iii)_ will be
adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

 

(e) No fraction of a share of HoldCo Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Delaware Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any
such fractional share shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of HoldCo Common
Stock (after aggregating all fractions of a share of HoldCo Common Stock
issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and, upon
surrender of such holders Company Stock Certificate(s) or the transfer of
Uncertificated Company Shares, be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to
the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such
fraction by the closing price of a Marvell Common Share on the Marvell Stock
Exchange on the date the Delaware Merger becomes effective.

 

1.8 Closing of Transfer Books.

 

(a) At the Bermuda Merger Effective Time: (i) except for Marvell Common Shares
that continue to be held by a Subsidiary of the Surviving Bermuda Company or
an Inphi Entity following the Bermuda Merger

 



4

Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Bermuda Merger
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and all holders of certificates representing Marvell Common Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Bermuda Merger Effective Time
(each such certificate, a " _Marvell Share Certificate_ ") or uncertificated
Marvell Common Shares represented by book entry positions (each such share, an
" _Uncertificated Marvell Share_ ") shall cease to have any rights as
shareholders of Marvell, other than the rights, if any, that such holders may
have under Section 106(6) of the Bermuda Companies Act; and (ii) the share
transfer books of Marvell shall be closed with respect to all Marvell Common
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Bermuda Merger
Effective Time. No further transfer of any such Marvell Common Shares shall be
made on such share transfer books after the Bermuda Merger Effective Time. If,
after the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, a valid Marvell Share Certificate or
Uncertificated Marvell Share is presented to the Exchange Agent or to the
Surviving Bermuda Company or HoldCo, such Marvell Share Certificate or
Uncertificated Marvell Share shall be canceled and may be exchanged as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.10_.

(b) At the Delaware Merger Effective Time: (i) except for Disregarded Company
Shares, all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Delaware Merger Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Delaware Merger
Effective Time (each such certificate, a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") or
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book
entry positions (each such share, an " _Uncertificated Company Share_ ")
shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, other than the
rights, if any, that such holders may have under Section 262 of the DGCL;
and (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect
to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Delaware Merger Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of
Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the
Delaware Merger Effective Time. If, after the Delaware Merger Effective Time,
a valid Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Company Share is presented
to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving Delaware Corporation or HoldCo,
such Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Company Share shall be
canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.11_.

 

1.9 Exchange Fund. On or prior to the Closing Date, HoldCo shall, and Marvell
shall cause HoldCo to, select a reputable bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent in the Mergers (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.12_, promptly after the
Delaware Merger Effective Time on the Closing Date, HoldCo shall: (a) deposit
with the Exchange Agent certificates or book entry positions representing the
shares of HoldCo Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Sections 1.7(a)(iii)_ and
_1.7(c)(iii)_ ; and (b) cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent cash
sufficient to make payments of the cash consideration payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.7(c)(iii)_ (including payments to be made in lieu of
fractional shares). The HoldCo Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited
with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or distributions received
by the Exchange Agent with respect to the deposited shares of HoldCo Common
Stock are referred to collectively as the " _Exchange Fund_." The cash
portion of the Exchange Fund will be invested by the Exchange Agent as
directed by HoldCo; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such investments shall
be in short-term obligations of the United States with maturities of no more
than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall
relieve HoldCo or the Exchange Agent from promptly paying the
cash consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.11(a)_, and
following any losses from any such investment, HoldCo shall promptly provide
additional cash funds to the Exchange Agent in the amount of such losses to
the extent the funds in the Exchange Fund are insufficient for such purposes,
which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.

 

1.10 Exchange of Marvell Share Certificates. Each Marvell Share Certificate,
other than a certificate representing a Disregarded Marvell Share, will, from
and after the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, represent an equivalent number of
shares of HoldCo Common Stock. At the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent will credit in the stock ledger and other appropriate books
and records of HoldCo an equivalent number of shares of HoldCo Common Stock
for any Uncertificated Marvell Shares represented by book entry positions,

 



5

    

 other than Disregarded Marvell Shares. After the Bermuda Merger Effective
Time, if an exchange of Marvell Share Certificates for new certificates
representing shares of HoldCo Common Stock is required by applicable Legal
Requirements, or is desired at any time by HoldCo, then HoldCo may arrange, in
its sole discretion, for such exchange on a one-for-one-share basis.

 

1.11 Exchange of Company Stock Certificates.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within three Business
Days) after the Delaware Merger Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will mail
to the Persons who, as of immediately prior to the Delaware Merger Effective
Time, were record holders of Company Stock Certificates and Uncertificated
Company Shares: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (including a
provision confirming that delivery of a Company Stock Certificate or transfer
of an Uncertificated Company Share will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to such Company Stock Certificate or such Uncertificated Company Share
will pass, only upon proper delivery of such Company Stock Certificate or
transfer of such Uncertificated Company Share to the Exchange Agent); and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates
or transfer of Uncertificated Company Shares in exchange for Delaware Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange
Agent for exchange (or compliance with the reasonable procedures established
by the Exchange Agent for transfer of Uncertificated Company Shares),
together with the delivery of a duly executed letter of transmittal and such
other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or HoldCo,
the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Company Shares
will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Delaware Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.7_, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock Certificate or
Uncertificated Company Shares and the Company Stock Certificate or
Uncertificated Company Shares so surrendered or transferred will be canceled.
Until surrendered or transferred as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
1.11(a)_, each Company Stock Certificate and Uncertificated Company Share
shall be deemed, from and after the Delaware Merger Effective Time,
to represent only the right to receive Delaware Merger Consideration as
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.7(c)_.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
HoldCo Common Stock with a record date after the Delaware Merger Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate or to the holder of any Uncertificated Company Share that has not
been transferred, in each case with respect to the HoldCo Common Stock that
such holder has the right to receive in the Delaware Merger, until such holder
surrenders such Company Stock Certificate or transfers such Uncertificated
Company Share in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ (at which time
such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable escheat or
similar laws, to receive all such dividends and distributions, without
interest).

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company Common
Stock which are not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment of Delaware Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than
the holder in whose name the Company Stock Certificate formerly representing
such shares or Uncertificated Company Shares is registered if: (i) any such
Company Stock Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer; and (ii) such holder has paid any fiduciary or surety bonds and any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of such
Delaware Merger Consideration to a Person other than such holder (or has
established to the reasonable satisfaction of HoldCo that such bonds and Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable).

 

(d) If any Company Stock Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, HoldCo may,
in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Delaware
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide
an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as HoldCo may
direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange
Agent, HoldCo or the Surviving Delaware Corporation with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any
cash consideration payable to holders of Company Stock Certificates or in
respect of Uncertificated Company Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.7_.

 



6

    

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to former
holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of the date that is 365 days
after the date on which the Delaware Merger becomes effective will be
delivered to HoldCo upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company
Common Stock who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock
Certificates, or complied with the procedures established by the Exchange
Agent for transfer of Uncertificated Company Shares, in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 1.11_ may thereafter look only to HoldCo for satisfaction of
their claims for Delaware Merger Consideration and any dividends or
distributions with respect to the shares of HoldCo Common Stock included in
the Delaware Merger Consideration.

 

(f) If any Company Stock Certificate has not been surrendered, or any
Uncertificated Company Share has not been transferred, by the earlier of (i)
the fifth anniversary of the date on which the Delaware Merger becomes
effective and (ii) the date immediately prior to the date on which the
Delaware Merger Consideration that such Company Stock Certificate
or Uncertificated Company Share represents the right to receive would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body, then
such Delaware Merger Consideration will, to the extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, become the property of HoldCo, free and clear of any
claim or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of HoldCo,
the Surviving Bermuda Company, the Surviving Delaware Corporation or the
Exchange Agent will be liable to any holder or former holder of Company
Common Stock or to any other Person with respect to any Delaware Merger
Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect to shares of HoldCo
Common Stock included in the Delaware Merger Consideration) delivered to
any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law,
escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.

(g) Each of the Exchange Agent, HoldCo, the Surviving Bermuda Company and the
Surviving Delaware Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or any Marvell Common
Share, Company Equity Award or Marvell Equity Award such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other
applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts will
be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

1.12 Dissenting Company Stockholders.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has made a proper demand
for appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and who has otherwise complied with all applicable
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as "
_Dissenting Company Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect
or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive Delaware Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.7(c)(iii)_, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are
granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Company Shares.

 

(b) If any Dissenting Company Shares lose their status as such (through
failure to perfect or otherwise), then such Dissenting Company Shares will be
deemed automatically to have been converted into, as of the Delaware Merger
Effective Time, and to represent only, the right to receive Delaware Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.7_, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate representing such
shares or, if such shares are Uncertificated Company Shares, upon compliance
with the procedures established by the Exchange Agent for the transfer of
such Uncertificated Company Shares, and HoldCo shall promptly deposit (or
cause to be deposited) in the Exchange Fund additional cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the cash portion of the Delaware Merger Consideration in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock that are no longer Dissenting
Company Shares.

 



7

    

(c) The Company shall give Marvell: (i) prompt notice of any demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Delaware Merger Effective
Time pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other
demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Delaware
Merger Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not voluntarily make any
payment or settlement offer prior to the Delaware Merger Effective Time with
respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless Marvell has given its
prior written consent to such payment or settlement offer.

 

1.13 Dissenting Marvell Shareholders.

 

(a) At the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, all Dissenting Marvell Shares will
be canceled and, unless otherwise required by applicable Bermuda Legal
Requirements, converted into the right to receive the shares of HoldCo Common
Stock such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.7(a)(iii)_, and any holder of Dissenting Marvell Shares shall, if the fair
value of a Dissenting Marvell Share as appraised by the Supreme Court of
Bermuda under Section 106(6) of the Bermuda Companies Act (the " _Appraised
Fair Value_ ") is greater than the fair value of the share of HoldCo
Common Stock exchanged therefor, be entitled to receive such difference from
the Surviving Bermuda Company by payment made within 30 days after such
Appraised Fair Value is finally determined pursuant to such appraisal
procedure.

 

(b) If a holder of Dissenting Marvell Shares who sought to exercise such
holders right to appraisal fails to properly exercise, or effectively
withdraws or otherwise waives, such holders right to appraisal (such
withdrawal or waiver, an " _Appraisal Withdrawal_ "), then such holder shall
have no other rights with respect to such Dissenting Marvell Shares other
than as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)(iii)_.

1.14 Further Action. If, at any time after the Delaware Merger Effective
Time, any further action is determined by HoldCo to be necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Bermuda
Company or the Surviving Delaware Corporation with full right, title and
possession of and to all rights and property of Marvell, Bermuda Merger Sub,
the Company and Delaware Merger Sub, then the officers and directors of
HoldCo, the Surviving Bermuda Company and the Surviving Delaware Corporation
are fully authorized (in the name of Marvell, in the name of Bermuda Merger
Sub, in the name of the Company, in the name of Delaware Merger Sub or
otherwise) to take such action.

is currently being conducted; (ii) to own and use its assets in the manner in
which its assets are currently owned and used; and (iii) to perform its

Each of the Inphi Entities is qualified to do business as a foreign entity and
is in good standing (in jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good
standing), under the laws of all jurisdictions where the nature of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have or result in a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

bylaws and other charter and organizational documents of each of the Inphi

Company Equity Plan (if any) pursuant to which such Company Equity Award was
granted; (2) the employee identification number of the holder of such Company

Company RSU, whether such Company RSU is subject to Section 409A of the Code

applicable vesting schedule; and (11) whether the vesting of such Company
Equity Award would be accelerated, in whole or in part, as a result of the
Delaware Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions, alone or in
combination with any termination of employment or other event. The exercise

Option. All grants of Company Equity Awards were recorded on the Companys
financial statements (including any related notes thereto) contained in the
Company SEC Reports in accordance with GAAP, and no such grants involved any
"back dating," "forward dating" or similar practices with respect to the
effective date of grant (whether intentionally or otherwise). From the close

if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement,
then on the date of such filing): (i) each of the Company SEC Reports complied
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (as the case may be);
and (ii) none of the Company SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated

the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. With respect to
each annual report on Form 10-K and each quarterly report on Form 10-Q

principal financial officer of the Company have made all certifications
required by Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (each such required certification, a "
_Certification_ "), and the statements contained in each Certification are
accurate and complete as of its date. For purposes of this Agreement, (A) "
_principal executive officer_ " and " _principal financial officer_ " shall
have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (B) the
term " _file_ " and variations thereof, when used in reference to the SEC,
shall be broadly construed to include any manner in which any document or
information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC. As

information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or any other employee who has (or has had) a significant role in
the Companys internal control over financial reporting; and (ii) "disclosure

the Companys filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. The
Company has Made Available to Marvell accurate and complete copies of the

contained in the Company SEC Reports, except as described in the Company SEC
Reports or except as may have been required or permitted by any regulatory
authority. The reserves reflected in such financial statements have been
determined and established in accordance with GAAP and have been calculated in
a consistent manner.

2.5 Absence of Changes. Between December 31, 2019 and the date of this
Agreement, there has not been any Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and
no event has occurred or circumstance has arisen that, in combination with any
other events or circumstances, would reasonably be expected to have or result
in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Between June 30, 2020 and the
date of this Agreement, none of the Inphi Entities has taken any action, or
authorized, approved, committed, agreed or offered to take any action, that if
taken during the Pre-Closing Period would require Marvells consent under
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(iii)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(iv)_ (with respect to the
Company itself),  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(v)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(x)_,
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(xi)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(xii)_, _Section_ __ _
4.2(b)(xv)_,  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(xvi)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(xvii)_,

31, 2019, there has not been any change in any Inphi Entitys sales patterns,
pricing policies, accounts receivable or accounts payable or any "channel
stuffing" or other sale method (including entering into any strategic purchase
arrangement or providing any incentive (such as reduced pricing, extended
payment terms or other similar incentives) designed to encourage accelerated
purchases of Inphi Products) that would have, or would reasonably be expected
to have, the effect of artificially increasing the Inphi Entities
consolidated revenues for fiscal year 2020.

2.6 Title to Assets. Except with respect to the Inphi Entities real property
(which is covered by _Section_ __ _ 2.7)_ and with respect to the Inphi
Entities Intellectual Property Rights (which is covered by _Section_ __ _

Sheet (except for inventory sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary
course of business since the date of the Company

 



12

    

 Balance Sheet); and (b) all such other assets reflected in the books and
records of the Inphi Entities as being owned by the Inphi Entities. All of

Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances.

2.7 Real Property; Equipment; Leasehold.

(a) None of the Inphi Entities owns any real property or any interest in real

occupancy agreement pursuant to which any of the Inphi Entities leases,
subleases or occupies real property from any other Person (the " _Leases_ ").
(All real property leased or subleased to the Inphi Entities, including all
buildings, structures, fixtures and other improvements leased or subleased to
the Inphi Entities, are referred to as the " _Leased Real Property_.") Except
as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company: (i) the Inphi Entities have a valid
and binding leasehold interest in each Leased Real Property pursuant to a
Lease, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances;
(ii) all of the Leases are valid and in full force and effect; and (iii) to
the Knowledge of the Company, there is no default or event which, with the
passage of time, the giving of notice or both, would become a default by any
party under any Lease. The Company has Made Available to Marvell accurate and
complete copies of all Leases.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, all of the buildings,
fixtures, additions and other improvements to the Leased Real Property are
adequate and suitable in all respects for the purpose of conducting the Inphi
Entities business as presently conducted. There is no Legal
Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing
that materially adversely affects, or would materially adversely affect, the
continuation of any Inphi Entitys present use or operation of any Leased Real
Property. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no existing plan or study
by any Governmental Body or any other Person that challenges or otherwise
adversely affects the continuation of any Inphi Entitys present use or
operation of any Leased Real Property. The Company has not received any
written notice of any condemnation proceedings relating to any Leased Real
Property and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condemnation proceedings
relating to any Leased Real Property are pending or threatened in writing.

not exclusively licensed any of its APIs, firmware or other Software.

(c) The Inphi Entities own all right, title and interest in and to (i) the

Proceedings related to any Inphi Associate that are pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against any Inphi Entity by or before any
Governmental Body or arbitrator relating to any Employment Law.

 

(g) Since January 1, 2016, no allegation, complaint, charge or claim (formal
or informal) of sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, gender
discrimination or similar behavior (a " _Sexual Misconduct Allegation_ ") has
been made against any person who is or was an officer, director, manager or
supervisory-level employee of any Inphi Entity in such persons capacity as
such or, to the Knowledge of the Company, in any other capacity. No Inphi
Entity has entered into any settlement agreement, tolling agreement, non-
disparagement agreement, confidentiality agreement or non-disclosure
agreement, or any Contract or provision similar to any of the foregoing,
relating directly or indirectly to any Sexual Misconduct Allegation against
any Inphi Entity or any person who is or was an officer, director or manager
of any Inphi Entity.

(h) _Part 2.16(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains an accurate
and complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of each material Inphi
Employee Plan and each material Inphi Employee Agreement and separately
identifies each material Foreign Inphi Plan. Except as required by
this Agreement, or to the extent permitted pursuant to _Section_ __ _
4.2(b)_, none of the Inphi Entities intends, and none of the Inphi Entities
has committed, to establish or enter into any new arrangement that would
constitute an Inphi Employee Plan or Inphi Employee Agreement, or to
materially modify any Inphi Employee Plan or Inphi Employee Agreement (except
to conform any such Inphi Employee Plan or Inphi Employee Agreement to the
requirements of any applicable Legal Requirements, in each case as previously
disclosed to Marvell in writing). The Company has Made Available to Marvell,
in each case, to the extent applicable: (i) accurate and complete copies of
all documents setting forth the terms of each material Inphi Employee Plan
and each material Inphi Employee Agreement, including all amendments thereto;
(ii) the most recent summary plan description, together with summaries of the
material modifications thereto, if any, required under ERISA with respect to
each material Inphi Employee Plan; (iii) the most recently filed annual report
(Form 5500 Series and all schedules and financial statements attached
thereto), if any, required under ERISA or the Code in connection with each
Inphi Employee Plan; (iv) the trust agreement, insurance Contract or other
funding instrument, if any, with respect to each material Inphi Employee Plan;
(v) all discrimination tests required under the Code for each Inphi
Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code for
the three most recent plan years; and (vi) the most recent IRS determination
or opinion letter issued with respect to each Inphi Employee Plan intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

(i) Each Inphi Employee Plan has been established, maintained and operated in
all material respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements, including ERISA and
the Code. Any Inphi Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to be qualified under Section
501(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter (or opinion
letter, if applicable) as to its qualified status under the Code and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred since the date of the most
recent determination that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
such qualification. Each Foreign Inphi Plan intended to qualify for special
tax treatment satisfies all requirements for such treatment. No "prohibited
transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406
and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has
occurred with respect to any Inphi Employee Plan between the Company and such
Inphi Employee Plan or, to the Knowledge of the Company, between any other
Person and such Inphi Employee

 



26

    

 Plan. Each Inphi Employee Plan that does not constitute a contract can be
amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Closing in accordance
with its terms, without material Liability to HoldCo, the Marvell Entities,
the Inphi Entities or any ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration
expenses). There is no audit, inquiry or Legal Proceeding pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated by the IRS,
DOL or any other Governmental Body with respect to any Inphi Employee Plan.
None of the Inphi Entities or any ERISA Affiliate has ever incurred any
material penalty or Tax with respect to any Inphi Employee Plan under Section
502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code. Each of the Inphi
Entities and ERISA Affiliates have timely made all contributions and other
payments required by and due under the terms of each Inphi Employee Plan,
except as would not result in material Liability and, to the extent not yet
due, such contributions and other payments have been adequately accrued in the
consolidated financial statements (including any related notes) contained or
incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Reports. Each Foreign Inphi Plan
that is required to be registered or approved by any Governmental Body under
applicable Legal Requirements has been so registered or approved.

 

(j) None of the Inphi Entities, and none of their respective ERISA Affiliates,
has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed
to, or been obligated to contribute to or has any Liability in respect of,
any: (i) Inphi Pension Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code; (ii) "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section (3)(37) of
ERISA; or (iii) plan described in Section 413 of the Code. No Inphi Employee
Plan is or has been funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary
employees beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code. No Inphi Employee Plan subject to ERISA holds stock issued by the
Company or any of its current ERISA Affiliates as a plan asset. The fair
market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Inphi Plan, the Liability
of each insurer for any Foreign Inphi Plan funded through insurance, or the
book reserve established for any Foreign Inphi Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide in full for the
accrued benefit obligations, with respect to all current and former
participants in such Foreign Inphi Plan according to the reasonable actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to and obligations under such Foreign Inphi Plan, and none of
the Contemplated Transactions will cause any such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations.

 

(k) No Inphi Employee Plan or Inphi Employee Agreement provides (except at no
cost to the Inphi Entities or any Affiliate of any Inphi Entity), or reflects
or represents any Liability of any of the Inphi Entities or any Affiliate of
any Inphi Entity to provide, post-termination or retiree life insurance, post-
termination or retiree health benefits (except for COBRA
reimbursements pursuant to a severance agreement that do not continue for
more than 18 months) or other post-termination or retiree employee welfare
benefits to any Person for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or
other applicable Legal Requirements. 

(l) Except as set forth in _Part 2.16(l)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
and except as expressly required or provided by this Agreement, neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions will (either alone or in combination with another event, whether
contingent or otherwise): (i) result in any payment (whether of bonus, change
in control, retention, severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness
of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to
fund benefits with respect to any Inphi Associate; or (ii) create any
limitation or restriction on the right of any Inphi Entity to merge, amend or
terminate any Inphi Employee Plan or Inphi Employee Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount payable to any Inphi
Associate as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of any of the Contemplated Transactions (either alone or in
combination with any other event) would be an "excess parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G or would be nondeductible under Section
280G of the Code. None of the Inphi Entities has any obligation to compensate
any Inphi Associate for any Taxes incurred by such Inphi Associate under
Section 4999 of the Code.

 

(m) Each Inphi Employee Plan, Inphi Employee Agreement or other Contract
between any Inphi Entity and any Inphi Associate that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" subject to Section 409A is and has at all times
been administered in documentary and operational compliance with the
requirements of Section 409A. 

 



27

    

 No Inphi Entity has any obligation to gross-up or otherwise reimburse any
Inphi Associate for any tax incurred by such person pursuant to Section 409A.

(n) Each Inphi Entity is, and since May 1, 2020 has been, in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable guidelines and requirements from the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. federal Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, and all applicable non-U.S., state and
local Governmental Bodies regarding COVID-19 safety precautions. If any
employee of any Inphi Entity has tested positive for COVID-19, the Inphi
Entities have taken all responsive action required under applicable Legal
Requirements with respect to such employee, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a material Liability to any Inphi Entity. Since
March 1, 2020, no Inphi Entity has: (i) taken any material action adversely
affecting the terms or conditions of employment of its current or former
employees or other service providers related to the COVID-19 pandemic in any
material respect, including implementing workforce reductions, terminations,
furloughs, deferral of payment or providing compensation or benefits, or
temporary or permanent reductions in compensation, benefits or working
schedules or Inphi Employee Plans; or (ii) applied for or received any loan
or deferred Tax, or claimed any Tax credit, under any applicable Legal
Requirement or any directive issued by, or under any program implemented or
sponsored by, any Governmental Body or public health agency in connection
with the COVID-19 pandemic.

2.17 Environmental Matters.

 

(a) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have or result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, each
of the Inphi Entities is, and since January 1, 2015 has been, in compliance in
all material respects with, and is not subject to any material Liability
under, all applicable Environmental Laws, including timely applying
for, possessing, maintaining, and materially complying with the terms and
conditions of all material Governmental Authorizations required under
applicable Environmental Laws. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the
properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by any of the
Inphi Entities contains any Hazardous Materials in amounts exceeding the
levels allowed by, requiring investigation or remediation under, or otherwise
permitted by, applicable Environmental Laws and that would reasonably be
expected to result in a material Liability of any Inphi Entity.

(b) Since January 1, 2018, or earlier for matters that remain unresolved,
none of the Inphi Entities has received any written notice or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, other communication from any Person that alleges
that any of the Inphi Entities is not in material compliance with, or has any
material Liability under, any Environmental Law. Except as could not
reasonably be expected to result in a material Liability to any Inphi Entity,
there has been no Release at, on, under or from any Leased Real Property or
any other property that is or was owned, operated or leased by any of the
Inphi Entities or at any property or facility at which any Inphi Entity has
arranged for the transportation, disposal or treatment of Hazardous Materials.

 

(c) The Company has Made Available to Marvell copies of all material
environmental assessments, Governmental Authorizations, reports, audits and
other material documents in the Inphi Entities possession or under their
control that relate to the Inphi Entities compliance with or any Liability
under any Environmental Law or the environmental condition of any
real property that any of the Inphi Entities currently or formerly has owned,
operated, or leased.

2.18 Insurance. The Company has Made Available to Marvell a copy of all
material insurance policies and all material self-insurance programs and
arrangements relating to the business, assets and operations of the Inphi
Entities. Each of such insurance policies is in full force and effect, no
written notice of a material default or termination has been received by any
Inphi Entity in respect thereof and all premiums due thereon have been paid in
full. Since January 1, 2019, none of the Inphi Entities has received
any written notice or, to the Knowledge of the Company, other written
communication regarding any: (a) cancellation or invalidation of any material
insurance policy; (b) refusal of any coverage or rejection of any material
claim under any insurance policy; or (c) material adjustment in the amount of
the premiums payable with respect to any insurance policy.

 



28

    

2.19 Legal Proceedings; Orders.

 

(a) There is no Legal Proceeding pending, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no Person has threatened to commence any Legal Proceeding, against
or involving any Inphi Entity. None of the Legal Proceedings identified in
_Part 2.19(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule has had or, if adversely
determined, could reasonably be expected to have or result in, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
event has occurred, and no claim, dispute or other condition or circumstance
exists, that could reasonably be expected, as of the date of this Agreement,
to give rise to or serve as a basis for the commencement of any such Legal
Proceeding.

(b) There is no Order to which any of the Inphi Entities, or any of
the assets owned or used by any of the Inphi Entities, is subject that would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially impact
the business or operations of the Inphi Entities. To the Knowledge of the
Company, no officer or other key employee of any of the Inphi Entities is
subject to any Order that prohibits such officer or employee from performing
such officers or employees duties or responsibilities as officers or
employees of any of the Inphi Entities. 

2.20 Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement. The Company has the necessary
corporate power and authority to enter into and to perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, subject,
in the case of the consummation of the Delaware Merger, only to the adoption
of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Vote. The Companys
board of directors (at a meeting duly called and held) has: (a) unanimously
determined that the Delaware Merger is advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company and its stockholders; (b) unanimously authorized

and (d) to the extent necessary, adopted a resolution having the effect of
causing the Company not to be subject to any state takeover law or similar
Legal Requirement that might otherwise apply to the Delaware Merger or any of
the other Contemplated Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

2.21 Takeover Statutes; No Rights Plan. Assuming the accuracy of Marvells
representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.16_, the
Companys board of directors has taken all actions necessary to ensure that
the restrictions applicable to business combinations contained in Section 203
of the DGCL are, and will be, inapplicable to the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement as it relates to the Delaware Merger. None of
such actions by the Companys board of directors has been amended, rescinded
or modified. There are no other "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover statutes
or regulations (each, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") in the United
States applicable to this Agreement, as it relates to the Delaware Merger.
The Company has no stockholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar agreement
or arrangement designed to have the effect of delaying, deferring or
discouraging any Person from acquiring control of the Company.

2.22 No Existing Discussions. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the
Inphi Entities, and no Representative of any of the Inphi Entities, is
engaged, directly or indirectly, in any discussions or negotiations with any
other Person relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal.

shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting (the " _Required Company Stockholder Vote_ ") is the
only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Companys capital stock
necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger.

 



29

    

2.24 Non-Contravention; Consents. Neither the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation of the
Delaware Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions, will directly
or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time): (a) contravene,
conflict with or result in a violation of any of the provisions of the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other charter or organizational
documents of any of the Inphi Entities; (b) contravene, conflict with or
result in a violation of, or give any Governmental Body or other Person the
right to challenge the Delaware Merger or any of the other Contemplated

Entities or to any of the assets owned or used by any of the Inphi Entities;

or result in a default under, any provision of any Material Contract, or give
any Person the right to: (i) declare a default or exercise any remedy under
any Material Contract; (ii) a rebate, chargeback, penalty or change in
delivery schedule under any Material Contract; (iii) accelerate the maturity

value or use of such asset for its current and anticipated purposes in any
material respect); except with respect to clauses "(b)" through "(e)" above,
for any such contraventions, conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or
other occurrences that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to be material to the Inphi Entities, taken as a whole. Except as
may be required by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state securities or
"blue sky" laws, the DGCL, the HSR Act, any foreign antitrust Legal
Requirement, any Legal Requirement administered by any Requesting Authority,
the __ Bermuda Companies Act or the Nasdaq Rules and listing standards, none
of the Inphi Entities is, or will be, required to make any filing with or give
any notice to, or to obtain any Consent from, any Person in connection with
the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Mergers or any of the other Contemplated Transactions
by the Company, except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually

Contemplated Transactions, except as would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Inphi Entities, taken as a
whole.

 

2.25 Fairness Opinion. The Companys board of directors has received from
Qatalyst Partners LP (" _Qatalyst_ "), financial advisor to the Company, its
opinion to the effect that, as of the date of its opinion, and based upon and
subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other
matters set forth therein, the consideration to be received by the holders of
Company Common Stock in the Delaware Merger pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (other than
Marvell and its Affiliates) entitled to receive such consideration. The
Company shall furnish a complete copy of such written opinion to Marvell as
soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement for
informational purposes only, and the Company has received the consent
of Qatalyst to include such opinion in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders success, completion or similar

3.18 Financing.

 

(a) Marvell has delivered to the Company accurate and complete copies of (i)
the executed 364-day bridge facility commitment letter, dated as of the date
of this Agreement (the " _Bridge Commitment Letter_ "), by and between Marvell
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (" _JPMorgan_ ") and (ii) the executed
facilities commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Term Loan Commitment Letter_ " and together with the Bridge 

 



36

    

 Commitment Letter, the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ "), by and between
Marvell and JPMorgan, pursuant to which the Financing Sources have committed,
subject to the terms thereof, to lend initially to Marvell or, after the
Closing Date, HoldCo, the amounts set forth therein for purposes of funding
the Contemplated Transactions on the Closing Date (the debt financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, including, for purposes of
_Section_ __ _ 5.18_, any offering of debt securities contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters, being collectively referred to as the " _Debt
Financing_ "). Marvell has also delivered to the Company accurate and
complete copies of any fee letters with any Financing Source (redacted solely
to the extent necessary to mask the fees payable to the Financing Sources in
respect of the Debt Financing, the rates and amounts included in the
"market flex" provisions and other economic terms that would not reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the enforceability, conditionality or
availability of, or the aggregate amount available under, the Debt Financing)
relating to the Debt Commitment Letters (any such fee letter, a " _Fee
Letter_ ").

(b) Assuming (i) the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letters, (ii) the Companys compliance with its covenants and
obligations contained in this Agreement such that the condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ would be satisfied, (iii) the accuracy, as of the
Closing Date, of the representations and warranties made by the Company in
this Agreement as if made on and as of the Closing Date such that the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ would be satisfied and (iv) the
satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
6_ and _Section_ __ _ 7_, the aggregate net proceeds from the Debt Financing
when funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letters, together with all
other sources of cash or other financing sources available to Marvell and
HoldCo, will be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of HoldCos payment
obligations under this Agreement, including payment when due of the cash
consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.7(c)(iii)_, and all costs
and expenses of the Contemplated Transactions which become due or payable by
HoldCo, Marvell, the Surviving Bermuda Company, the Surviving Delaware
Corporation or any Inphi Entity in connection with the Mergers, and any
repayment or refinancing of indebtedness contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters (collectively, the " _Financing Uses_ ").

 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, each Debt Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letters have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded, the commitment
amount set forth in each Debt Commitment Letter has not been reduced, and,
except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.18_, the Debt Commitment Letters
have not otherwise been amended, supplemented or modified and Marvell has not
received any written communications from any of the Financing Sources that
would make the foregoing untrue. Each Debt Commitment Letter (i) is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Marvell, enforceable against Marvell in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions, and (ii),
to the knowledge of Marvell, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Financing Sources, enforceable against the Financing Sources in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than
as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters. Marvell has paid in
full any and all commitment fees or other fees and amounts owed in connection
with the Debt Commitment Letters that are due and payable on or prior to the
date of this Agreement and has satisfied all other terms required to be
satisfied as of the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts, understandings
or arrangements of any kind relating to the Debt Commitment Letters or the
Fee Letters that would reasonably be expected to affect the availability of
the Debt Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming (A) the
Companys compliance with its covenants and obligations contained in this
Agreement such that the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ would be
satisfied, (B) the accuracy, as of the Closing Date, of the representations
and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement as if made on and as of
the Closing Date such that the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_
would be satisfied and (C) the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6_ and _Section_ __ _ 7_, (1) no
event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would
constitute a default or breach or failure to satisfy a condition by Marvell
or, to the knowledge of Marvell, any other party thereto, under the terms of
the Debt Commitment Letters and (2) Marvell has no knowledge of any facts that
would result in any of the conditions to the Debt Financing set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letters not being satisfied by Marvell or HoldCo on or prior
to the Closing Date.

 



37

    

3.19 Solvency. Assuming (a) the representations and warranties contained in
_Section_ __ _ 2_ are accurate as of the date of this Agreement and will be
accurate as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date (in
each case, disregarding all "Material Adverse Effect" and other materiality
and similar qualifications limiting the scope of such representations and
warranties), (b) the satisfaction of all of the conditions contained in
_Section_ __ _ 6_, (c) that any pro forma financial statements, estimates,
projections or forecasts of the Inphi Entities were prepared in good faith and
were and continue to be based on reasonable assumptions and (d) immediately
prior to the Delaware Merger Effective Time, the Inphi Entities are
Solvent (substituting references to "HoldCo" in such definition with
references to the "Company"), immediately following the Closing, after giving
effect to the Contemplated Transactions, HoldCo and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Bermuda Company and the Surviving Delaware
Corporation), taken as a whole, will be Solvent. As used herein, " _Solvent_ "
means, with respect to HoldCo and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
immediately following the Closing, that: (i) the fair value of the property
of HoldCo and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately following the
Closing is greater than the total amount of liabilities, including, contingent
liabilities, of HoldCo and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately
following the Closing; (ii) the present fair salable value of the assets of
HoldCo and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately following the
Closing is not less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liability of HoldCo and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on their debts as
they become absolute and matured; (iii) immediately following the Closing,
HoldCo and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, do not have outstanding
debts or liabilities beyond their ability to pay such debts and liabilities
as they mature; and (iv) immediately following the Closing, HoldCo and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are not engaged in a business or a
transaction, and are not proposing to engage in a business or a transaction,
for which HoldCos and its Subsidiaries property, taken as a whole, would
constitute an unreasonably small amount of capital. The amount of contingent
liabilities at any time shall be computed under this _Section_ __ _ 3.19_ as
the amount that, in the light of all the facts and circumstances existing
immediately following the Closing, is probable to become an actual or matured
liability.

 

3.20 Fairness Opinion. Marvells board of directors has received the written
opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (" _J.P. Morgan Securities_ "),
financial advisor to Marvell, dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect
that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions,
limitations, qualifications and other matters considered in the preparation
thereof, the Delaware Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of
Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point
of view to Marvell. Marvell has received the consent of J.P. Morgan
Securities to include such opinion in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

3.21 Advisors Fees. Except for J.P. Morgan Securities, no Person is entitled
to any brokerage, finders, success, completion or similar fee or commission
in connection with the Mergers or any of the other Contemplated Transactions
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of any of the Marvell Entities.

3.22 Disclosure. None of the information to be supplied by or on behalf of
Marvell or HoldCo specifically for inclusion in the Form S-4 Registration
Statement will, at the time the Form S-4 Registration Statement becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. None of the
information to be supplied by or on behalf of Marvell or HoldCo specifically
for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the time the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is mailed to the stockholders of the Company
or the shareholders of Marvell or at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting or the Marvell Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by Marvell,
HoldCo, Delaware Merger Sub or Bermuda Merger Sub with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by
any Inphi Entity for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys

time of such meeting, the reasons for holding such meeting and a reasonably
detailed description of such Marvell Change in Circumstances; (C) Marvells
board of directors determines in good faith, after having taken into account
the advice of an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and the advice of Marvells outside legal counsel, that, in light
of such Marvell Change in Circumstances, the failure to make a Marvell Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to
Marvells shareholders under applicable Bermuda law; (D) no less than
four Business Days prior to making a Marvell Adverse Recommendation Change,
Marvells board of directors delivers to the Company a written notice (1)
stating that a Marvell Change in Circumstances has arisen, (2) stating that it
intends to make a Marvell Adverse Recommendation Change in light of such
Marvell Change in Circumstances and describing the intended Marvell Adverse
Recommendation Change and (3) containing a reasonably detailed description of
such Marvell Change in Circumstances; (E) throughout such four Business Day
period, Marvell engages (to the extent requested by the Company) in good faith
negotiations with the Company to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
the failure to make a Marvell Adverse Recommendation Change would not be
inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of Marvells board of directors to
Marvells shareholders under applicable Bermuda law in light of such Marvell
Change in Circumstances; and (F) at the time of making such Marvell Adverse
Recommendation Change, Marvells board of directors determines in good faith,
after taking into account the advice of an independent financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and the advice of Marvells outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make a Marvell Adverse Recommendation Change
would still be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of Marvells board
of directors to Marvells shareholders under applicable Bermuda law in light
of such Marvell Change in Circumstances; _provided_ , _however_ , that when
making such determination, Marvells board of directors shall be obligated to
consider any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Company
in writing as a result of the negotiations required by clause "(E)" above.

(g) Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit Marvell from: (i) taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) __ making any disclosure to its
shareholders if Marvells board of directors determines in good faith, after
having taken into account the advice of Marvells outside legal counsel, that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to
Marvell and Marvells shareholders under applicable Bermuda law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(g)_ shall not be deemed to permit
Marvell __ s board of directors to make a Marvell Adverse Recommendation
Change or take any of the actions referred to in 

 



54

    

 clause "(ii)" or clause "(iv)" of _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ except to the
extent permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_ (it being understood and agreed
that any disclosure of the type described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(g)_,
other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, shall be
deemed to be a Marvell Adverse Recommendation Change unless Marvells board of
directors publicly and unanimously reaffirms the Marvell Board Recommendation
in such disclosure).

 

(h) Subject to Marvells right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(k)_, Marvells obligation to call, give notice of and
hold the Marvell Shareholders Meeting in accordance with _Section_ __ _
5.3(a)_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the making,
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Disruptive
Marvell Superior Offer, by any Marvell Change in Circumstances or by any
withdrawal or modification of the Marvell Board Recommendation.

 

5.4 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

 

(a) At the Delaware Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Delaware Merger
and without any action on the part of any Person, each In-the-Money Company
Option that is vested and held by a Person who is not a Continuing Employee or
a Continuing Service Provider (each, a " _Company Cash-Out Option_") will be
canceled and extinguished, and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive
(subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes, or other amounts
required by applicable Legal Requirements to be withheld) an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Cash-Out Option, _multiplied by_ (ii) the excess of
(A) the Equity Award Cash Consideration Amount _over_ (B) the per share
exercise price for the Company Common Stock subject to such Company Cash-Out
Option. Following the Delaware Merger Effective Time, any such canceled
Company Cash-Out Option shall entitle the former holder of such Company Cash-
Out Option only to the payment described in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_,
which shall be made by the Surviving Delaware Corporation within 10 Business
Days after the Delaware Merger Effective Time.

 

(b) At the Delaware Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Delaware Merger
and without any action on the part of any Person, each In-the-Money Company
Option that is held by a Continuing Employee or a Continuing Service Provider,
whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by HoldCo and converted into an
option to purchase, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Option, that number of shares of HoldCo Common
Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option,
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Conversion Ratio, at an exercise price per share of
HoldCo Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
quotient obtained by  _dividing_ (A) the per share exercise price for the
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, _by_ (B) the Conversion
Ratio (each such assumed Company Option, as so adjusted, a " _Converted
Option_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that, following the Delaware Merger
Effective Time, all references to the "Company" in each Company Equity Plan
and each award agreement shall be deemed to be references to HoldCo, and no
portion of any Converted Option shall be exercisable prior to vesting. The
assumption and conversion of Converted Options contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 5.4(b)_ shall in each case be effected in a manner intended to comply
with Section 409A of the Code.

(c) At the Delaware Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Delaware Merger
and without any action on the part of any Person, each Out-of-the-Money
Option and each In-the-Money Company Option that is unvested and held by a
Person who is not a Continuing Employee or a Continuing Service Provider shall
be canceled and extinguished for no consideration.

(d) At the Delaware Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Delaware Merger
and without any action on the part of any Person, each Company RSU that is
outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Delaware Merger Effective
Time and held by a Continuing Employee or Continuing Service Provider shall be
converted into that number of HoldCo restricted stock units, rounded down to
the nearest whole share, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU, _multiplied by_ (ii) the
Conversion Ratio (each such assumed Company RSU, as so adjusted, a "
_Converted RSU_ "). Any Converted RSU

 



55

    

 issued pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_ shall be subject to
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company
RSU prior to the Delaware Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all references to the "Company" in each Company Equity Plan and each
award agreement shall be deemed to be references to HoldCo.

 

(e) At the Delaware Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Delaware Merger
and without any action on the part of any Person, each Company RSU and each
Company PSU that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Delaware
Merger Effective Time and held by a Person who is not a Continuing Employee or
a Continuing Service Provider shall be canceled and extinguished for no
consideration.

(f) At the Delaware Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Delaware Merger
and without any action on the part of any Person, each Company RSU that is
outstanding and vested (and with respect to which shares of Company Common
Stock have not yet been issued) immediately prior to the Delaware Merger
Effective Time (including those Company RSUs that become vested immediately
prior to or as of the Delaware Merger Effective Time) shall be canceled and
extinguished, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (subject to
any applicable withholding or other Taxes, or other amounts required
by applicable Legal Requirements to be withheld, which withholding shall
first be applied against the cash portion of the consideration paid in respect
of a vested Company RSU): (i) an amount in cash equal to the product of (A)
the Per Share Cash Amount, _multiplied by_ (B) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU; and (ii) a number of shares
of HoldCo Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the Exchange Ratio,
_multiplied by_  (B) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company RSU. Following the Delaware Merger Effective Time, any
such canceled Company RSU shall entitle the former holder of such Company RSU
only to the payment described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(f)_, which shall be
made by the Surviving Delaware Corporation within 10 Business Days after the
Delaware Merger Effective Time or at such other time or times following the
Delaware Merger Effective Time consistent with the terms of the Company RSU
to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of additional income Tax under
Section 409A of the Code.

 

(g) At the Delaware Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Delaware Merger
and without any action on the part of any Person, each Company MSU that is
outstanding (and with respect to which shares of Company Common Stock have not
yet been issued) immediately prior to the Delaware Merger Effective Time shall
be canceled and extinguished. Each such Company MSU shall be deemed to vest
in that percentage of the shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
Company MSU determined by (i) applying the formula set forth in the award
agreement governing the Company MSU, (ii) using the Closing Date as the end of
the performance period and (iii) using the Equity Award Cash Consideration
Amount as the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock at the end
of the performance period. The resulting number of shares of Company Common
Stock shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and shall be the "
_Vested Company MSU Shares_." The holder of each such Company MSU shall be
entitled to receive (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes, or
other amounts required by applicable Legal Requirements to be withheld, which
withholding shall first be applied against the cash portion of the
consideration paid in respect of such Company MSU): (A) an amount in cash
equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Cash Amount, _multiplied by_ (2)
the number of Vested Company MSU Shares; and (B) a number of shares of HoldCo
Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the Exchange Ratio, _multiplied by_
(2) the number of Vested Company MSU Shares. Following the Delaware Merger
Effective Time, any such canceled Company MSU shall entitle the former holder
of such Company MSU only to the payment described in this _Section_ __ _
5.4(g)_, which shall be made by the Surviving Delaware Corporation within 10
Business Days after the Delaware Merger Effective Time or at such other time
or times following the Delaware Merger Effective Time consistent with the
terms of the Company MSU to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of
additional income Tax under Section 409A of the Code. Any portion of the
Company MSU that does not constitute Vested Company MSU Shares shall be
canceled and extinguished for no consideration.

 

(h) At the Delaware Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Delaware Merger
and without any action on the part of any Person, each Company PSU that is
outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Delaware Merger Effective
Time and is held by a Continuing Employee or Continuing Service Provider shall
be

 



56

    

 assumed and converted into that number of HoldCo restricted stock units,
rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to the product of (i) the
target number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU,
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Conversion Ratio (each such assumed Company PSU, as
so adjusted, a " _Converted PSU_ "). Any Converted PSU issued pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(h)_: (A) shall vest based on the vesting date or
schedule set forth in the award agreement applicable to such Company PSU prior
to the Delaware Merger Effective Time, subject only to the continued service
of the grantee with the Surviving Delaware Corporation, Marvell or any of
their Affiliates through the applicable vesting date; (B) shall not be subject
to any performance-based vesting terms following the Delaware Merger Effective
Time; and (C) shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions
(modified as appropriate to reflect the assumption contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(h)_) as were applicable under such Company PSU prior to
the Delaware Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
references to the "Company" in each Company Equity Plan and each award
agreement shall be deemed to be references to Marvell. Each Converted PSU that
vests after the Delaware Merger Effective Time shall be settled in HoldCo
Common Stock.

(i) Effective immediately prior to the Delaware Merger Effective Time, each
Director Option and each Director RSU that is then outstanding and unvested
shall be vested in full.

(j) Prior to the Delaware Merger Effective Time, each of Marvell, HoldCo and
the Company shall take all actions necessary (including obtaining any required
consents) to effectuate the provisions set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5.4_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such action taken shall be required
to be irrevocable until immediately prior to the Delaware Merger Effective
Time. HoldCo agrees to file, as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event
later than 10 Business Days after the Delaware Merger Effective Time, a
registration statement on Form S-8 (if available for use by HoldCo) with
respect to the shares of HoldCo Common Stock issuable with respect
to Converted Options, Converted PSUs and Converted RSUs, in each case that
are eligible to be registered on Form S-8, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as the Converted Options, Converted PSUs and
Converted RSUs assumed in accordance with this Agreement remain outstanding.
In connection with the filing of a registration statement on Form S-8, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys
independent registered public accounting firm to consent to the incorporation
by reference of the audit reports included in the Companys annual audited
consolidated financial statements.

 5.5 Treatment of Company ESPP. As soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall take all action that may be necessary to provide
that: (a) no new offering period (or similar period during which shares may
be purchased) shall commence under the Company ESPP following the date of this
Agreement; (b) participants in the Company ESPP as of the date of this
Agreement may not increase their payroll deductions under the Company ESPP
from those in effect on the date of this Agreement; and (c) no new
participants may commence participation in the Company ESPP following the date
of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in any event
prior to the Closing), the Company shall take such action as may be necessary
to: (i) cause any offering period (or similar period during which shares may
be purchased) in progress under the Company ESPP as of the date of this
Agreement to be the final offering period under the Company ESPP and to be
terminated no later than five Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date (the " _Final Exercise Date_ "); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that
may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period (or similar period),
but otherwise treat such shortened offering period (or similar period) as a
fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the
Company ESPP; (iii) cause each participants then-outstanding share purchase
right under the Company ESPP (the " _Company ESPP Rights_ ") to be exercised
as of the Final Exercise Date; and (iv) terminate the Company ESPP as of the
Delaware Merger Effective Time. On the Final Exercise Date, the funds credited
as of such date under the Company ESPP within the associated accumulated
payroll withholding account for each participant under the Company ESPP shall
be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of the Company ESPP (as amended pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_),
and each share purchased thereunder immediately prior to the Delaware Merger
Effective Time will be canceled at the Delaware Merger Effective Time and
converted into the right to receive the Delaware Merger Consideration in
accordance with 

 



57

    

  _Section_ __ _ 1.7(c)_, subject to withholding of any applicable income
and employment withholding Taxes. Any accumulated contributions of each
participant under the Company ESPP as of immediately prior to the Delaware
Merger Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase shares in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company ESPP (as amended
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_), be refunded to such participant as
promptly as practicable following the Delaware Merger Effective Time (without
interest). No further Company ESPP Rights shall be granted or exercised under
the Company ESPP after the Final Exercise Date. The Company shall provide
timely notice to participants of the setting of the Final Exercise Date and
the termination of the Company ESPP in accordance with the terms of the
Company ESPP.

 

5.6 Treatment of Marvell Equity Awards.

 

(a) At the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Bermuda Merger and
without any action on the part of any Person, each Marvell Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, will be converted into a stock option in respect of shares
of HoldCo Common Stock, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Marvell Option immediately prior to the Bermuda Merger Effective
Time (including with respect to vesting), relating to the number of shares of
HoldCo Common Stock equal to the total number of Marvell Common Shares subject
to such Marvell Option immediately prior to the Bermuda Merger Effective Time
and with an exercise price per share of HoldCo Common Stock equal to the
exercise price per Marvell Common Share subject to such Marvell Option
immediately prior to the Bermuda Merger Effective Time.

(b) At the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Bermuda Merger and
without any action on the part of any Person, each Marvell RSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Bermuda Merger Effective Time will be
converted into a restricted stock unit award with the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Marvell RSU immediately prior to the
Bermuda Merger Effective Time (including with respect to vesting and timing of
payment), and relating to the number of shares of HoldCo Common Stock equal to
the total number of Marvell Common Shares subject to such Marvell RSU
immediately prior to the Bermuda Merger Effective Time.

(c) At the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Bermuda Merger and
without any action on the part of any Person, each Marvell PSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Bermuda Merger Effective Time will be
converted into a performance-based restricted stock unit with the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under such Marvell PSU immediately prior to
the Bermuda Merger Effective Time (including with respect to vesting, except
that the performance measures shall relate to HoldCo), and relating to the
number of shares of HoldCo Common Stock equal to the total number of Marvell
Common Shares subject to such Marvell PSU immediately prior to the Bermuda
Merger Effective Time.

 

(d) At the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Bermuda Merger and
without any action on the part of any Person, any rights to purchase Marvell
Common Shares under the Marvell ESPP that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Bermuda Merger Effective Time will be converted into rights to purchase
shares of HoldCo Common Stock on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under the Marvell ESPP immediately prior to the Bermuda
Merger Effective Time, and relating to the number of shares of HoldCo Common
Stock equal to the total number of Marvell Common Shares subject to the
Marvell ESPP immediately prior to the Bermuda Merger Effective Time.

(e) At the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, HoldCo shall assume the Marvell
Equity Plans. All references in a Marvell Equity Plan or award agreement
thereunder to a number of Marvell Common Shares shall be deemed amended to
refer instead to a number of shares of HoldCo Common Stock, and the
compensation committee of HoldCos board of directors shall succeed to the
authority and responsibility of Marvells board of directors or any committee
thereof with respect to the administration of any Marvell Equity Plan.

 

(f) Prior to the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, each of Marvell, HoldCo and
the Company shall take all actions necessary (including obtaining any
required consents) to effectuate the provisions set forth in this

 



58

    

  _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, except that no such action taken shall be required to
be irrevocable until immediately prior to the Bermuda Merger Effective Time.
HoldCo agrees to file, as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event
later than 10 Business Days after the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, a
registration statement on Form S-8 (if available for use by HoldCo) with
respect to the shares of HoldCo Common Stock issuable with respect to the
settlement of converted Marvell Equity Awards, and with respect to offerings
made under the Marvell ESPP, in each case that are eligible to be registered
on Form S-8, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status
of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the
Marvell Equity Awards and the Marvell ESPP assumed in accordance with this
Agreement remain outstanding.

 

5.7 Employee Benefits.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Delaware Merger Effective Time (but
only as long as the relevant Continuing Employee remains employed by HoldCo
or any of its Affiliates), and subject to the applicable Legal Requirements of
each jurisdiction, Marvell and HoldCo agree to, or to cause the Surviving
Delaware Corporation to, maintain, for each Continuing Employee: (i) base
salary that is no less than the base salary provided to such employee
immediately prior to the Delaware Merger Effective Time; and (ii) benefits
that are, in the aggregate, either (at Marvells discretion), (A) no
less favorable to the Continuing Employee than the benefits provided to the
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Delaware Merger Effective Time or
(B) that are substantially similar to the benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Marvell or the applicable Affiliate of HoldCo
(excluding for purposes of this clause "(ii)," any defined benefit plan
participation, employee stock purchase plan participation, any equity-based
compensation and any change in control, retention or similar one-time special
payments or benefits) and reasonably comparable in the aggregate to the
benefits provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Delaware
Merger Effective Time. Continuing Employees shall retain their target bonus
opportunity, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, for the remainder of
the bonus plan year in which the Delaware Merger Effective Time occurs. The
parties acknowledge and agree that Marvell does not have a profit sharing
plan that will be in effect after the Delaware Merger Effective Time.

(b) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by HoldCo or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Bermuda Company or the Surviving Delaware Corporation) in which any of the
Continuing Employees participate following the Delaware Merger Effective Time
(each, a " _Marvell Employee Plan_ "), and except to the extent necessary to
avoid duplication of benefits, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate and vesting, service with any Inphi Entity (or predecessor
employers, to the extent the applicable Inphi Entity provides past service
credit under its benefit plans) shall, to the extent permitted by the terms of
the applicable Marvell Employee Plan, be treated as service with HoldCo or
the applicable Marvell Entity. Each applicable Marvell Employee Plan shall,
to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable Marvell Employee Plan,
waive eligibility waiting periods and pre-existing condition limitations to
the extent waived or not included under the corresponding Inphi Employee Plan.
To the extent permitted under the applicable Marvell Employee Plan, HoldCo and
Marvell agree to give or cause to be given to Continuing Employees credit
under the applicable Marvell Employee Plan for amounts paid prior to the
Delaware Merger Effective Time during the calendar year in which the Delaware
Merger Effective Time occurs under a corresponding Inphi Employee Plan for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Marvell Employee Plan.

(c) Marvell and HoldCo agree that all Continuing Employees located in the U.S.
shall be eligible to continue to participate in the Surviving Delaware
Corporations health and welfare benefit plans, subject in each case to the
terms and conditions of such plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall: (i) be
construed to create a right in any Inphi Associate to employment with HoldCo,
the Surviving Bermuda Company, the Surviving Delaware Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates; (ii) be deemed to establish, amend, modify or
cause to be adopted any Inphi Employee Plan or any other benefit plan,

 



59

    

 program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by HoldCo, the
Surviving Bermuda Company, the Surviving Delaware Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates; or (iii) limit the ability of HoldCo, the Surviving
Bermuda Company, the Surviving Delaware Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates from establishing, amending, modifying or terminating any benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established,
sponsored or maintained by any of them, in each case, following the Delaware
Merger Effective Time. Except for Indemnified Persons (to the extent of their
rights pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.8_), no Inphi Associate shall be deemed
to be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section_
__ _ 5.7(a)_ shall limit the effect of _Section_ __ _ 9.7_.

 

(d) Unless otherwise requested by Marvell in writing at least two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken)
all actions that may be necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no
later than the day prior to the date on which the Mergers become effective,
any Inphi Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Company 401(k)
Plan_ "). If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan,
then the Company shall provide to Marvell prior to the Closing Date written
evidence of the adoption by the Companys board of directors of resolutions
authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to the prior review and approval of
Marvell), effective no later than the day prior to the date on which the
Mergers become effective. The Company also shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating such Company 401(k) Plan as Marvell may reasonably
request. If the distributions of assets from the trust of any Company 401(k)
Plan that is terminated pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.7(d)_ are
reasonably anticipated to cause or result in liquidation charges, surrender
charges or other fees to be imposed upon the account of any participant or
beneficiary of such Company 401(k) Plan or upon the Company or any
participating employer, then the Company shall take such actions as are
necessary to estimate the amount of such charges or other fees and provide its
estimate of that amount in writing to Marvell at least three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. In the event of such termination of the Company
401(k) Plan, promptly following the Closing Date, HoldCo and Marvell shall
cause such Marvell Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code which includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended to
qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code to accept eligible (i) rollover
contributions in cash of amounts distributed to Continuing Employees from the
Companys 401(k) Plan and (ii) in-kind rollovers of Continuing Employees loan
balances, and will provide for continued repayments of any such loans through
payroll deductions commencing not later than with the first payroll period
ending not more than 14 days following the date of such rollover.

(e) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements are
imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to any of the
Contemplated Transactions, the Company shall consult with Marvell and shall
ensure that such notification or consultation requirements are complied with
prior to the Delaware Merger Effective Time. Prior to making any written or
broad-based oral communications to any Inphi Associate prior to the Delaware
Merger Effective Time regarding post-Closing employment matters, including
post-Closing employee benefits and compensation or other compensation or
benefits matters related to or impacted by any of the Contemplated
Transactions (whether alone or in combination with additional
events), including the matters described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_, the
Company shall provide, and shall ensure that the other Inphi Entities and its
and their respective Representatives shall provide, Marvell with a copy of the
intended communication for its written approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

5.8 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) All rights to indemnification by the Company existing in favor of those
Persons who are now, or have been at any time prior to the Delaware Merger
Effective Time, directors and officers of any Inphi Entity (the " _Company_
_Indemnified Persons_ ") for their acts and omissions as directors and
officers occurring prior to the Delaware Merger Effective Time, as provided
in the Companys or the applicable Inphi Entitys certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents (as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement) and as provided in those indemnification
agreements between an Inphi Entity and such Company Indemnified Persons (as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement) Made Available to Marvell, will
survive the Delaware Merger and 

 



60

    

 continue in full force and effect (to the extent such rights to
indemnification are available under and consistent with applicable Delaware
law) for a period of six years following the date on which the Delaware
Merger becomes effective.

(b) All rights to indemnification by Marvell existing in favor of those
Persons who are now, or have been at any time prior to the Bermuda Merger
Effective Time, directors and officers of any Marvell Entity (the " _Marvell_
_Indemnified Persons_ " and, together with the Company Indemnified Persons,
the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") for their acts and omissions as directors and
officers occurring prior to the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, as provided in
Marvells or the applicable Marvell Entitys memorandum of association, bye-
laws or other organizational documents and as provided in any indemnification
agreements between a Marvell Entity and such Marvell Indemnified Persons, will
survive the Bermuda Merger and continue in full force and effect (to the
extent such rights to indemnification are available under and consistent with
applicable law) for a period of six years following the date on which the
Bermuda Merger becomes effective.

 

(c) From the date on which the Bermuda Merger Effective Time occurs until the
sixth anniversary of such date, HoldCo, the Surviving Bermuda Company and the
Surviving Delaware Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of
the Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions as directors
and officers occurring prior to the Delaware Merger Effective Time,
the existing policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by Marvell and the Company, respectively, as of the date of this
Agreement (and with respect to those policies maintained by the Company, in
the form Made Available to Marvell) (the " _Existing D andO Policies_"), to the
extent that such directors and officers liability insurance coverage is
available on commercially reasonable terms, except that: (i) each of
HoldCo, the Surviving Bermuda Company and the Surviving Delaware Corporation
may substitute for the Existing DandO Policies other policies of comparable
coverage; and (ii) none of HoldCo, the Surviving Bermuda Company or the
Surviving Delaware Corporation will be required to pay annual premiums for
such Existing DandO Policy (or for any substitute policies) in excess of 300% of
the annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement for the Existing
DandO Policy (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If any future annual premiums for an
Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute policy therefor) exceed the Maximum
Premium in the aggregate, then HoldCo, the Surviving Bermuda Company or the
Surviving Delaware Corporation may reduce the amount of coverage of such
Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute policy therefor) to the amount of
coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal to the Maximum Premium. The
Surviving Bermuda Company and the Surviving Delaware Corporation or, prior to
the Delaware Merger Effective Time, the Company shall have the right to
purchase a pre-paid, non-cancellable "tail" policy on any Existing DandO Policy
for a claims reporting or discovery period of six years from the Closing Date
and otherwise on terms and conditions that are no less favorable than the
terms and conditions of the applicable Existing DandO Policy; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that none of HoldCo, the Surviving Bermuda Company or the
Surviving Delaware Corporation shall be obligated to, and the Company shall
not (without the prior written consent of Marvell), expend an amount for such
"tail" policy in excess of the Maximum Premium. If such "tail" policy is
purchased by the Surviving Delaware Corporation or the Surviving Bermuda
Company (a " _Tail Policy Purchaser_ "), such Tail Policy Purchaser shall,
and HoldCo shall cause such Tail Policy Purchaser to, maintain such "tail"
policy in full force and effect in lieu of all other obligations of such Tail
Policy Purchaser under the first sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.8(c)_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by: (i) each of the Company Indemnified
Persons, who are intended third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _
5.8_ from and after the Delaware Merger Effective Time; and (ii) each of the
Marvell Indemnified Persons, who are intended third-party beneficiaries of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ from and after the Bermuda Merger Effective Time.

 

5.9 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.

other Contemplated

 



61

    

 Transactions, and to submit promptly any additional information requested by
any such Governmental Body. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

 

(i) the Company and Marvell shall: (A) promptly as practicable after the date

received from any state attorney general, foreign antitrust authority or other
Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or related matters; and

(ii) except to the extent Marvell determines otherwise, each Principal Party
shall (A) as soon as possible after a Requesting Authority asserts or
attempts to assert jurisdiction over, or requests, requires or attempts to
require a filing or submission relating to, the Bermuda Merger, the Delaware
Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions, and consistent with any
Legal Requirement, file and submit (in accordance with each Legal Requirement
that may be applicable or that such Requesting Authority asserts to be
applicable) all notices, reports and other non-privileged documents required
or requested by such Requesting Authority to be filed or submitted on behalf
of such Principal Party, and (B) respond as promptly as possible to any
inquiries or requests received from such Requesting Authority for additional
non-privileged information or non-privileged documentation.

 

(b) Subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Marvell and the Company each shall promptly supply the other

Subsidiaries set forth in) _Section_ __ _ 5.9(a)_.

Governmental Body, and subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)_ and the
confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, each Principal
Party shall: (i) consult with the other Principal Party in good faith prior to
taking a position with respect to any filing or submission required by
_Section_ __ _ 5.9(a)_; (ii) permit the other Principal Party to review and
discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other
Principal Party in connection with, any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, white papers, arguments, opinions or proposals before
making or submitting any of the foregoing to any Governmental Body on behalf
of any party hereto in connection with any filing or submission required by

with regulatory authority related to this Agreement or any of the Contemplated
Transactions; (iii) coordinate with the other Principal Party in preparing
and exchanging such information; (iv) promptly provide the other Principal
Party (and its counsel) with copies of all filings, notices, analyses,

submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made or submitted by
such Principal Party with or to any Governmental Body in connection with any
filing or submission required by _Section_ __ _ 5.9(a)_; and (v) provide the
other Principal Party with reasonable notice of and opportunity to participate
in any substantive conversation or meeting with a Governmental Body required
by _Section_ __ _ 5.9(a)_. Neither Marvell nor the Company shall commit to
or agree (or permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to commit to or
agree) with any Governmental Body to stay, toll or extend any applicable
waiting period under any applicable antitrust laws without the prior
written consent of the other Principal Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) Each Principal Party shall notify the other Principal Party promptly upon
the receipt of: (i) any communication from any official of any Governmental
Body in connection with any filing or submission made pursuant to this
Agreement; (ii) Knowledge of the commencement or threat of commencement of
any Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the
Delaware Merger, the Bermuda Merger or any of the other Contemplated
Transactions (and shall keep the other Principal Party informed as to the
status of

 



62

    

 any such Legal Proceeding or threat); and (iii) any request by any official
of any Governmental Body for any amendment or supplement to any filing or
submission made pursuant to this Agreement or any information required to
comply with any Legal Requirement applicable to the Delaware Merger, the
Bermuda Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions. Whenever any
event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to any filing or submission made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.9(a)_, each
Principal Party shall (promptly upon learning of the occurrence of such event)
inform the other Principal Party of the occurrence of such event and
cooperate in filing with or submitting to the applicable Governmental Body
such amendment or supplement.

(e) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.9(f)_, each of Marvell, HoldCo and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary to consummate the Mergers and make effective the
other Contemplated Transactions on a timely basis (other than with respect to
obtaining Consents under Contracts, for which each of Marvell, HoldCo and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, but subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.9(f)_, each
party: (i) shall make all filings (if any), give all notices (if any) and
provide all information (if any) required to be made, given or provided by
such party in connection with the Bermuda Merger, the Delaware Merger or any
of the other Contemplated Transactions; (ii) shall consult with such partys
employees to the extent required under any applicable Legal Requirement in
connection with the Mergers or any of the other Contemplated Transactions;
and (iii) shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain each Consent (if
any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement) by
such party in connection with the Delaware Merger, the Bermuda Merger or any
of the other Contemplated Transactions. Each Principal Party shall consult
with the other Principal Party with respect to all of the matters contemplated
by clauses "(i)," "(ii)" and "(iii)" of the preceding sentence, and will keep
the other Principal Party apprised of the status of matters relating to the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. At the request of Marvell, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the divestiture, holding
separate or taking of any other action with respect to any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of the Inphi Entities (provided that any such action
is conditioned upon the consummation of the Mergers).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.9(e)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement: (i) no Marvell Entity shall have any
obligation under this Agreement to: (A) propose, negotiate, commit to or
effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, disposition or license (or similar arrangement) of, or limit
Marvells freedom of action with respect to, any of the businesses, product
lines or assets of any Marvell Entity or any Inphi Entity, or otherwise
propose, proffer or agree to any other requirement, obligation, condition,
limitation or restriction on any of the businesses, product lines or assets of
any Marvell Entity or any Inphi Entity, unless the actions referred to in this
clause "(A)" (1) are reasonably necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth
in _Sections_ ___6.8_ and _7.8_ and (2) would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a significant impact on the
strategic or financial benefits of the Mergers to Marvell; (B) amend or
modify any of Marvells, HoldCos, Bermuda Merger Subs or Delaware Merger
Subs rights or obligations under this Agreement; or (C) restructure or commit
to restructure any of the Contemplated Transactions; (ii) none of the Inphi
Entities shall, except with the prior written consent of Marvell, agree,
commit or propose, or encourage any Governmental Body, to take or request any
of the actions described in clause "(i)(A)" above; (iii) Marvell shall have
no obligation to commence or contest, or cause any other Marvell Entity or any
of their respective Affiliates to commence or contest, any Legal Proceeding
relating to the Delaware Merger, the Bermuda Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions if Marvell reasonably determines in good faith that
contesting such Legal Proceeding would not be advisable; (iv) if Marvell
reasonably determines in good faith that contesting a Legal Proceeding
referred to in clause "(iv)" above would not be advisable, none of the Inphi
Entities shall have any obligation to contest such Legal Proceeding; and (v)
nothing in _Section_ __ _ 5.9(e)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall require Marvell to, directly or indirectly, divest, transfer or
otherwise dispose of, hold separate or commit to cause any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates to divest, transfer or otherwise dispose of or hold separate all
or any portion of (A) the ASIC business of the Marvell Entities, (B) the
copper PHY business of the Marvell Entities or (C) any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of any Inphi Entity.

 



63

    

5.10 Disclosure. Marvell and the Company: (a) have agreed to the text of the
joint press release and investor relations presentation announcing the signing
of this Agreement; and (b) shall consult with each other before issuing any
further press release or otherwise making any public statement, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior written consent of the other Principal Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing:
(i) each of Marvell and the Company may, without such consultation or
consent, make any public statement in response to questions from the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences and make internal
announcements to employees, so long as such statements or announcements are
consistent with (and not materially expansive of) previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements or announcements made jointly by the
Principal Parties (or individually, if approved by the other Principal
Party); (ii) Marvell or the Company may, without the prior consent of the
other Principal Party, issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement or statement as may be required by a Legal Requirement or the
Nasdaq Rules if it first notifies and consults with the other Principal Party
prior to issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement
or statement; (iii) the Company need not consult with (or obtain the consent
of) Marvell in connection with any press release, public statement or filing
to be issued or made with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal or any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and (iv) Marvell need not consult with
(or obtain the consent of) the Company in connection with any press release,
public statement or filing to be issued or made with respect to any Disruptive
Marvell Acquisition Proposal or any Marvell Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

5.11 Resignation of Officers and Directors. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Marvell at or prior to the
Delaware Merger Effective Time (or, at the option of Marvell, at a later date)
the resignation of each individual who is an officer or director of any of the
Inphi Entities, effective as of the Delaware Merger Effective Time (it being
understood that such resignation shall not constitute a voluntary termination
of employment under any Inphi Employee Agreement or Inphi Employee Plan
applicable to such individuals status as an officer or director of an Inphi
Entity).

5.12 Delisting. Prior to the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, the Company shall
cooperate with Marvell and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Legal Requirements
(including the Nasdaq Rules) to enable the de-listing by the Surviving
Delaware Corporation of the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq and the
deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly
as practicable after the Delaware Merger Effective Time.

5.13 Nasdaq Listing. HoldCo and Marvell shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause to be approved for listing (subject to official notice of
issuance) on Nasdaq at or prior to the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, under
the trading symbol "MRVL", (a) the shares of HoldCo Common Stock to be issued
in connection with the Mergers and (b) the shares of HoldCo Common Stock to be
reserved upon settlement or exercise of equity awards in respect of HoldCo
Common Stock.

 

5.14 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Bermuda Merger Effective Time, Marvell,
HoldCo and the Company shall take all steps that may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or Marvell Common Shares (including
derivative securities with respect to Marvell Common Shares) or
acquisitions of HoldCo Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to HoldCo Common Stock) resulting from the Mergers and the matters
contemplated by _Sections 5.4_ , _5.5_ and _5.6_ by each individual who is, or
as a result of the Contemplated Transactions will be, subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Marvell, the Company or HoldCo, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements.

5.15 Stockholder Litigation. Without limiting in any way the respective
obligations of Marvell and the Company under _Section_ __ _ 4.2(d)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)_, each of Marvell and the Company shall notify the
other

 



64

    

 Principal Party of any Legal Proceeding (including any class action or
derivative litigation) that is commenced or threatened against such Principal
Party or any of its officers or directors relating to the Mergers or any of
the other Contemplated Transactions promptly after becoming aware of such
Legal Proceeding. The Company shall give Marvell the opportunity to
participate, at Marvells expense, in the defense or settlement of any such
Legal Proceeding against the Company or any of its officers or directors, and
no such settlement shall be agreed to, and no agreement or arrangement with
any stockholder shall be entered into by the Company outside the ordinary
course of business, without the prior written consent of Marvell, which
consent with respect to any such settlement shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

5.16 Takeover Statutes and Rights. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to this Agreement, the Delaware Merger, the Bermuda Merger or any
of the other Contemplated Transactions, the Company and the board of directors
of the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals
and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
Takeover Statute on this Agreement, the Mergers and the other Contemplated
Transactions.

 

5.17 Tax Matters. The parties intend that (a) the Mergers, taken together,
qualify as a transaction described in Section 351 of the Code and (b) the
Bermuda Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. The parties hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan
of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code.
Each of Marvell, HoldCo and the Company will (and will cause its Subsidiaries
to) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Mergers, taken together, to
qualify, and will not take or knowingly fail to take any action (and will
cause its Subsidiaries not to take or knowingly fail to take any action) which
action or failure to act could reasonably be expected to impede or prevent the
Mergers, taken together, from qualifying, as a transaction described in
Section 351 of the Code. Each of Marvell, HoldCo and the Company will (and
will cause its Subsidiaries to) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Bermuda Merger to qualify, and will not take or knowingly fail to take any
action (and will cause its Subsidiaries not to take or knowingly fail to take
any action) which action or failure to act could reasonably be expected to
impede or prevent the Bermuda Merger from qualifying, as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

5.18 Financing.

 

(a) Marvell and HoldCo shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
do all things necessary or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the
Debt Financing on or prior to the date the Closing is required to be effected
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, on the terms and conditions
(including, to the extent applicable, the "flex" provisions) described in the
Debt Commitment Letters (it being understood that, for purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.18_, references to the Debt Commitment Letters shall be
deemed to include any Fee Letter), including using their respective
reasonable best efforts to: (i) enter into definitive agreements with respect
to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions (as such terms may be
modified or adjusted in accordance with the terms, and within the limits, of
the "flex" provisions contained in any Fee Letter or as otherwise agreed by
Marvell, HoldCo and the Financing Sources, subject to the restrictions on
amendments of the Debt Commitment Letters set forth below) contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters (the " _Definitive Debt Financing Agreements_ "); and
(ii) satisfy (or obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions and
comply with all obligations applicable to Marvell and HoldCo, including
with respect to the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees,
in the Debt Commitment Letters and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements to
the extent a failure to do so would result in a failure of a condition
precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing. If all conditions to the Debt
Financing have been satisfied and the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
6_ have been satisfied or waived, Marvell and HoldCo shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take all actions within its control to cause the
Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing at or prior to Closing, including
to seek to enforce its rights with respect to funding under the Debt
Commitment Letters and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements in the event
of a breach thereof by the Financing Sources party thereto.

 



65

    

(b) Marvell and HoldCo shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to
any condition, or waive any of their respective rights, under the Debt
Commitment Letters or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements without the
prior written consent of the Company if any such amendment, modification or
waiver of the Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements would (x) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an
amount that, together with HoldCos and Marvells cash on hand, would be less
than an amount reasonably required to consummate the Mergers, (y) impose new
or additional conditions or (z) otherwise amend, modify or expand any
conditions to the initial funding of the Debt Financing, in each case, in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to: (i) materially delay or prevent
the Closing from occurring; or (ii) adversely impact the ability of Marvell or
HoldCo to (A) enforce their respective rights against the other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements or (B)
cause the Mergers to be timely consummated (it being understood that Marvell
and HoldCo may amend, restate, modify or supplement each of the Debt
Commitment Letters or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters, syndication agents or
similar entities that have not executed such Debt Commitment Letters as of the
date of this Agreement, to provide for the assignment and reallocation of a
portion of the debt financing commitments contained in such Debt Commitment
Letters or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements and to grant customary
approval rights to such additional arrangers and other Entities in connection
with such appointments as expressly set forth in such Debt Commitment
Letters, in each case, without the Companys consent, provided that such
amendment would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
Closing). Marvell and HoldCo shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters (and any Definitive
Debt Financing Agreements) until the earliest to occur of the Closing, the
consummation of the Debt Financing and the valid termination of this
Agreement. 

(c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letters, and such portion of the Debt Financing is reasonably
determined by Marvell to be required to consummate the Mergers and perform its
other obligations under this Agreement, then Marvell shall promptly notify
the Company in writing and use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, arrange and obtain from
alternative sources of debt financing that are reasonably acceptable to
Marvell in an amount (together with all other sources of cash or other
financing sources available to Marvell) sufficient to satisfy the Financing
Uses. The exercise of such reasonable best efforts shall not require Marvell
or HoldCo to obtain additional equity or debt with an all-in yield or tenor
that is different than the debt financing set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters (after giving effect to the maximum amount of any "flex"
provisions contained therein). The new debt commitment letter and fee letter
entered into in connection with any such alternative financing pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.18(b)_ or this _Section_ __ _ 5.18(c)_, are referred to,
respectively, as a " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ " and a " _New Fee Letter_."
None of Marvell, HoldCo, Delaware Merger Sub or Bermuda Merger Sub shall enter
into such New Debt Commitment Letter without the consent of the Company if
the terms thereof, or if the conditions to funding thereunder, would
reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or prevent the Closing or
would, when taken as a whole, be materially less favorable to Marvell or
HoldCo than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters. If Marvell and/or
HoldCo enter into any New Debt Commitment Letter: (i) any reference in this
Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall mean the debt financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to clause "(ii)" below;
and (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letters" (and
any definition incorporating the term "Debt Commitment Letters," including
the definition of "Definitive Debt Financing Agreements") shall be deemed to
include (A) the Debt Commitment Letters and any Fee Letter to the extent not
superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter, as the case may
be, at such time, and (B) any New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter to
the extent then in effect.

(d) Marvell shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to, keep the Company informed as promptly as practicable upon
written request in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Marvell
shall: (i) upon the Companys written request, furnish the Company with
executed copies of any amendments to the Debt Commitment Letters (with any fee
letter redacted in a customary manner) promptly upon their execution; and
(ii) give the Company prompt written notice (A) of any amendment to the Debt
Commitment Letters, (B) of any

 



66

    

 default or material breach (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would give rise to any default or material breach) under, or
repudiation of, the Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements by any Financing Source party thereto, in each case, of which
Marvell becomes aware, (C) of any termination of the Debt Commitment Letters,
(D) of the receipt of any written notice from any Person with respect to any
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt
Commitment Letters or any Definitive Debt Financing Agreement relating to the
initial availability or amount of the Debt Financing and (E) if for any
reason Marvell believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive
Debt Financing Agreements, as the case may be.

(e) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall ensure that
each of the other Inphi Entities and its and their respective Representatives
shall, use reasonable best efforts to provide to or at the direction of
Marvell and HoldCo all cooperation reasonably requested by Marvell or HoldCo
in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (or any replacement,
amended, modified, alternative or substitute financing or refinancing,
including an underwritten offering of securities, permitted by this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.18_ (each, an " _Alternative Financing_ ")), including using
reasonable best efforts to:

 

(i) cooperate reasonably with any customary due diligence investigation
reasonably conducted by the Financing Sources in connection with the Debt
Financing or any Alternative Financing, including by providing any documents
or other information requested that is customarily provided in connection with
transactions of that type and by causing the management of the Company, with
appropriate seniority and expertise, outside counsel and external auditors to
participate in a reasonable number of due diligence sessions, in each case,
upon reasonable notice and at mutually agreeable dates and times;

 

(ii) cause management of the Company, with appropriate seniority and
expertise, and other representatives to participate in a reasonable number of
telephone calls, meetings (including lender meetings), presentations,
roadshows, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies, in each case,
upon reasonable notice and at mutually agreeable dates and times;

 

(iii) provide reasonable and customary assistance with the preparation of
customary offering and syndication documents and materials, including rating
agency presentations, road show materials, lender and investor presentations,
bank information memoranda, prospectuses and bank syndication materials,
offering documents, private placement memoranda and similar documents
customarily required (which may incorporate, by reference, periodic and
current reports filed by the Company with the SEC) in connection with the
marketing and syndication of the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing,
and upon reasonable request, identify any material non-public information
contained in such materials and make such disclosures as may be required to
comply with Regulation FD to the extent applicable to such material non-public
information;

(iv) (A) obtain customary payoff letters (in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Marvell) at or prior to Closing and such other documents
reasonably requested by Marvell or the Financing Sources relating to the
repayment of the existing indebtedness for borrowed money of any of the
Inphi Entities and the release of any related liens, provided the Company
shall not be required to deliver any notice of prepayment or redemption or
similar notice or document in respect of repayment, redemption or defeasance
of indebtedness (or termination of commitments) that is not conditioned on
the consummation of the Mergers or that if the Mergers are not consummated
results in liability to the Company and (B) provide, at least five Business
Days before the Closing Date, all documentation and other information
required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable "know-your-customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT
Act, relating to any of the Inphi Entities, in each case as requested by
Marvell;

(v) furnish to or at Marvells discretion, within a reasonable amount of time
following Marvells reasonable request, financial and other information
relating to the Company and the other Inphi Entities to the extent (i)
maintained, prepared or updated by the Company or its Representatives in the
ordinary course

 



67

    

 of business or the Company or its Representatives are able to provide such
information without undue burden or expense as determined by the Company in
its sole discretion and (ii) customarily provided in connection with
transactions of the type contemplated by the Debt Financing in accordance with
the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters as in effect on the date of this
Agreement or any substantially similar terms of any Alternative Financing,
including delivery of (A) GAAP audited consolidated balance sheets and related
audited statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows of the
Company for each of the three fiscal years most recently ended at least 60
days prior to the Closing Date and (B) GAAP unaudited consolidated balance
sheets and related unaudited statements of income, stockholders equity (to
the extent available) and cash flows of the Company for each subsequent
fiscal quarter ended at least 40 days prior to the Closing Date, which
financial statements in each case shall meet in all material respects the
requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and all other
accounting rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable
to a registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-3, provided
that the public filing of any required financial statements or other public
information filed with the SEC shall constitute delivery of such financial
statements or other public information;

 

(vi) provide reasonable assistance to Marvell and HoldCos preparation of pro
forma financial information (meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X under
the Securities Act) and projections customarily provided in connection with
transactions of the type contemplated by the Debt Financing or any Alternative
Financing (provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.18_, the Company and its Representatives shall not (x) be
required to provide any information that the Company does not maintain, or
provide any information at times as the Company does not prepare or update,
in each case, in the ordinary course of business (other than any information
that the Company is able to provide without undue burden or expense as
determined by the Company in its sole discretion), and (y) be responsible for
the preparation of such pro forma financial information (or any related pro
forma adjustments or assumptions) or such projections);

 

(vii) take such actions as are reasonably requested by Marvell to facilitate
the satisfaction on a timely basis of all conditions precedent to obtaining
the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing that are within the Companys
control;

 

(viii) cause its independent auditors to participate in a reasonable number of
drafting sessions and accounting due diligence sessions and cooperate with
the Debt Financing and any Alternative Financing consistent with their
customary practice, including requesting that they provide customary comfort
letters (including "negative assurance" comfort), agreed-upon procedures
letters and customary consents or authorization letters to the inclusion of
the Companys auditor reports, in each case, to the extent required in
connection with the marketing and syndication of the Debt Financing (as set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letters as in effect on the date of this
Agreement) or as are customarily required in any other Alternative Financing;

 

(ix) assist with the preparation and enter into (as of the Closing) Definitive

9.9 Cooperation. Each Principal Party agrees to cooperate with the other
Principal Party and to execute and deliver such further documents,
certificates, agreements and instruments and to take such other actions as may
be reasonably requested by the other Principal Party to evidence or
reflect the Contemplated Transactions and to carry out the intent and
purposes of this Agreement.

9.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto
agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid
and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision. In the event that the parties are unable to agree to such
replacement, the parties agree that the court making the determination
referred to above shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so modified.

9.11 Remedies. The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement required to
be performed by any of the parties were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by any party of any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, any non-breaching party shall be
entitled to obtain, without proof of actual damages (and in addition to any
other remedy to which such non-breaching party may be entitled at law or in
equity): (a) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce
the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation; and (b) an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. Each of the parties
hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with any such remedy. Except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __
_ 8.3(i)_, any and all remedies in this Agreement expressly conferred upon a
Principal Party shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred by this Agreement, or by law or equity upon such Principal
Party, and the exercise by a Principal Party of any one remedy shall not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or
injunctive relief. Without limiting the rights of Marvell under the Debt
Commitment Letter or the rights of any of the Marvell Entities under any
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, the Company agrees that none of the (i)
Financing Sources or (ii) their respective Affiliates or any of such Financing
Sources or their Affiliates respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, shareholders, managers, members, agents,
officers, directors, employees, accountants, advisors or representatives or
any of their respective successors or assigns (the Persons described in this
clause "(ii)" being collectively referred to as the " _Financing Source
Related Parties_ ") shall have any liability or obligation to the Company,
its stockholders or its Affiliates relating to this Agreement or any of the
Contemplated Transactions (including the Debt Financing), whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall

applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." All
references in this Agreement to "dollars" or "$" shall mean United States
Dollars.
