Kenexa Technology or the Surviving Corporation any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of such consideration to a Person other
than that of the registered holder of the Membership Unit Certificates or
BRINC Share Certificates so surrendered, or such Person shall establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of Kenexa Technology or the Surviving Corporation
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

  

### (d) In the event that any Membership Unit Certificates or BRINC Share
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Kenexa Technology or
Parent shall pay such portion of the Membership Units Consideration or Merger
Consideration as may be required pursuant to this Agreement in exchange
therefor upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof,
together with an unsecured indemnity in customary form in favor of

Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_ prior to that time
thereafter will look only to Kenexa Technology or the Escrow Agent, if
applicable, for payment of any applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
in respect thereof. None of Kenexa Technology, BRLLC or BRINC shall be liable
to any Equityholder for cash from the Membership Units Consideration or
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any

stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for its capital
stock.

such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Laws
with respect to Taxes. If BRLLC, BRINC, Kenexa Technology, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds any such amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid on behalf of the applicable Person in respect of which
BRLLC, BRINC, Kenexa Technology, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

  

## Section 2.14. _Working Capital Adjustments_.

  

### (a) (i) The parties have contemplated that the Working Capital of BRLLC
as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date (the " **Closing Working Capital** "), as calculated in
accordance with this Agreement and the Statement of Net Working Capital
attached hereto as **_Exhibit A_** (the " **Form Working Capital Statement**
"), will equal the Working Capital Target.

  

#### (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, Working Capital shall be calculated
in accordance with this Agreement (including **_Exhibit A_** to this
Agreement and _Section 2.15_ ) and with GAAP applied using the
same accounting methods, policies, practices and procedures, with
consistent classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were
used in preparation of the Audited Financial Statements; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (1) Working Capital shall be calculated to exclude (A) any
changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting
adjustments, or (B) other changes arising from or resulting as a consequence
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (2)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.14(a)(ii)_, to
the extent any provision of this _Section 2.14(a)(ii)_ is inconsistent with
**_Exhibit A_** attached hereto, the provisions of such **_Exhibit
A_** shall prevail and be controlling.

  

### (b) No later than four (4) Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing,
BRLLC shall cause to be prepared **** and delivered to Kenexa Technology, a
certificate signed by the Chief Financial Officer of BRLLC attaching a
reasonable and good faith estimate of the Closing Working Capital (the "
**Estimated Working Capital** "). The Estimated Working Capital shall
be calculated in the same manner as Working Capital is to be calculated
pursuant to this Agreement and shall be presented in the same form as the
Form Working Capital Statement. Upon delivery of the Estimated Working
Capital to Kenexa Technology, BRLLC shall provide Kenexa Technology and its
representatives with reasonable access to the officers, employees, agreements
and books and records of BRLLC and BRINC to verify the reasonableness of such
amount.

  

### (c) In the event that the Estimated Working Capital is less than the
Working Capital Target (the amount by which the Estimated Working Capital is
less than the Working Capital Target shall be referred to herein as the "
**Estimated Working Capital Deficiency** "), then, at Closing: (i) the
Enterprise Value (and as a result, the Net Enterprise Value, the Membership
Units Consideration and the Merger Consideration) shall be reduced by an
amount equal to one half of the Estimated Working Capital Deficiency and (ii)
the Indemnity Escrow

     

   



  

### Amount shall be reduced by an amount equal to one half of the Estimated
Working Capital Deficiency.

  

### (d) Kenexa Technology shall cause to be prepared and, as soon as
practical, **** but **** in no event later than **** 120 days after the
Closing Date, **** shall cause to be delivered to the Representative, a
calculation **** of the Closing Working Capital (the " **Initial**
**Calculation** "), together with **** such schedules and data with respect
to the determination of the Closing Working Capital as may be reasonably
necessary to support such Initial Calculation and allow for its verification
and a report of BDO Seidman, LLP on the Initial Calculation, which report
shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination. The
Initial Calculation shall be prepared in accordance with this Agreement
(including in compliance with the provisions of _Section 2.14(a)(ii)_,
_Section 2.15_ and **_Exhibit A_** attached hereto) and shall be in the
same form as the Form Working Capital Statement. Kenexa Technology agrees
that, following the Closing through the date that the Closing Working Capital
becomes final and binding on the parties hereto in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, it will not take, and it will not permit the Surviving
Corporation, BRLLC or any of their respective Subsidiaries to take, any
actions with respect to any accounting books, records, policies or procedures
on which the Closing Working Capital is to be based or derived from that
would impede or delay the determination of the Closing Working Capital in the
manner and utilizing the methods required by this Agreement.

  

### (e) If the Representative disagrees in whole or in part with the Initial
Calculation, then within 60 days after its receipt of the Initial
Calculation, it shall notify Kenexa Technology of such disagreement in
writing (the " **Notice of Disagreement** "), setting forth in reasonable
detail the particulars of any such disagreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such objection shall be limited to any failure to prepare the
Initial Calculation in accordance with this _Section 2.14_ , _Section 2.15_
and  ** _Exhibit A_**, any inaccuracy in any supporting data or failure of
Kenexa Technology to provide any existing supporting documentation, and to
mathematical or similar errors. During such 60-day period, the
Representative shall have access to the working papers, schedules and
calculations of Kenexa Technology used in the preparation of the Initial
Calculation and the determination of Closing Working Capital.  To be
effective, any such Notice of Disagreement shall include a copy of Kenexa
Technologys Initial Calculation marked to indicate those specific line items
that are in dispute (the " **Disputed Line Items** ") and shall be
accompanied by the Representatives calculation of each of the Disputed Line
Items and the Representatives revised Initial Calculation setting forth its
determination of the Closing Working Capital. To the extent the Representative
provides a Notice of Disagreement within such 60-day period, all items that
are not Disputed Line Items shall be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes hereunder. In the event that the Representative does not provide a
-Notice of Disagreement within such 60-day period, the Representative shall
be deemed to have accepted in full the Initial Calculation as prepared
by Kenexa Technology, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for
all purposes hereunder. In the event any Notice of Disagreement is timely
provided and contains the proper information as aforesaid, Kenexa Technology
and the Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period
of 60 days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any
Disputed Line Items. During such 60-day period, Kenexa Technology and the
Representative shall have access to the working papers, schedules
and calculations of the other used in the preparation of the Initial
Calculation and the Notice of Disagreement and the determination of the
Closing Working Capital and Disputed

     

   

### Line Items. If, at the end of such period, Kenexa Technology and the
Representative are unable to resolve such Disputed Line Items, then Grant
Thornton LLP or, failing such independent accounting firms willingness to so
serve, such other independent accounting firm of recognized national standing
as may be mutually selected by Kenexa Technology and the Representative shall
resolve any remaining Disputed Line Items; _provided_ ,  _however_ , if
Kenexa Technology and the Representative are unable to so agree within 5 days
after Grant Thornton LLP informs either Kenexa Technology or the
Representative of its unwillingness to so serve (the " **Decline Date** "),
then within 10 days after the Decline Date, each of Kenexa Technology and the
Representative shall select an office of an independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing and such two firms shall, within 15 days after
the Decline Date, then select a third independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing to resolve any remaining Disputed Line Items
(any such accountants selected pursuant to this _Section 2.14_ to resolve
Disputed Line Items, the " **Settlement Accountants** "). Kenexa Technology
and the Representative will enter into reasonable and customary arrangements
for the services to be rendered by the Settlement Accountants under this
_Section 2.14_. The Settlement Accountants shall determine as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 60 days from the date that the dispute
is submitted to it), whether the Initial Calculation was prepared in
accordance with this _Section 2.14_ , _Section 2.15_ and **_Exhibit
A_** and whether and to what extent (if any) the Closing Working Capital
requires adjustment, limiting its review, however, only to the Disputed Line
Items so submitted. The Settlement Accountants shall only resolve each
Disputed Line Item by choosing the amounts submitted by either Kenexa
Technology or the Representative for such Disputed Line Item. Kenexa
Technology and the Representative shall each furnish to the Settlement
Accountants such work papers and other documents and information relating to
the disputed issues, and shall provide interviews and answer questions, as
such Settlement Accountants may reasonably request. The determination of the
Settlement Accountants shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties.
The fees and expenses of the Settlement Accountants shall be paid one half by
each of Kenexa Technology and the Equityholders (acting through the
Representative).

  

### (f) " **Negative** **Adjustment Amount** " shall mean the amount by which
(i) the Closing Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance with
this _Section 2.14_ , is less than (ii) the Estimated Working Capital;
provided, that if the Closing Working Capital, as finally determined in
accordance with this _Section 2.14_ , is greater than or equal to
the Estimated Working Capital, there shall be no Negative Adjustment Amount.
" **Positive Adjustment Amount** " shall mean the amount by which (i) the
Closing Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance with this
_Section 2.14_ , is greater than (ii) the Working Capital Target; provided,
that if the Closing Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance with
this _Section 2.14_ , is less than or equal to the Working Capital Target,
there shall be no Positive Adjustment Amount.

  

### (g) If there is a Negative Adjustment Amount, then Kenexa Technology and
the Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent to deliver from the Indemnity Escrow Account to Kenexa Technology,
BRLLC or the Surviving Corporation, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Kenexa Technology, an amount
equal to the Negative Adjustment Amount, together with interest thereon from
the Closing Date to the date of payment at a rate of interest of 4% per
annum. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in
_Article X_ , to the extent that any

     

   



  

### portion of the Negative Adjustment Amount (together with the referenced
interest) paid to Kenexa Technology, BRLLC or the Surviving Corporation under
this _Section 2.14(f)_ exceeds $1,000,000 (any such excess, an " **Excess
Negative Adjustment Amount** ") and, as a result thereof, the Indemnity
Escrow Amount is insufficient to satisfy claims by the Kenexa Indemnified
Parties for indemnification pursuant to _Article X_  (the amount of such
insufficiency, the " **Indemnity Escrow Amount Shortfall** "), the applicable
limitations of _Section 10.2(c)_  shall not apply to limit the amount
otherwise payable to Kenexa Indemnified Parties with respect to claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Article X_  and the Equityholders shall be
severally but not jointly liable to the Kenexa Indemnified Parties for the
Indemnity Escrow Amount Shortfall but only up to the Excess Negative
Adjustment Amount.

  

### (h) If there is a Positive Adjustment Amount, then Kenexa Technology or
Parent shall promptly deposit such Positive Adjustment Amount in the
Indemnity Escrow Account (to be held and disbursed in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement), and such
Positive Adjustment Amount shall be allocated among the Equityholders in
proportion to the respective portions of the Indemnity Escrow Amount
allocated to Equityholders as set forth in Equityholder Allocation Statement.

  

### (i) Any Negative Adjustment Amount or Positive Adjustment Amount paid
pursuant to this _Section 2.14_ shall be deemed an adjustment to the
Enterprise Value. For purposes of this _Section 2.14_ , all computations of
interest shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days, in each case for
the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last
day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. Any payments
made by any Person pursuant to this _Section 2.14_ shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds within thirty (30) days after the
date on which the Closing Working Capital is final and binding on the
parties.

  

## Section 2.15. _Calculations_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement, the parties hereto covenant and agree that no amount
shall be (or is intended to be) included, in whole or in part (either as an
increase or a reduction), more than once in the calculation of (including any
component of) the Enterprise Value, the Net Enterprise Value, the Membership
Units Consideration, the Merger Consideration, Estimated Working Capital or
any other calculated amount pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such
additional inclusion (either as an increase or a reduction) would be to cause
such amount to be over- or under-counted for purposes of such calculation.
The parties hereto further covenant and agree that if any provision of this
Agreement requires an amount or calculation to be "determined in accordance
with this Agreement and GAAP" (or words of similar import), then to the
extent that the terms of this Agreement (including **_Exhibit
A_**) conflict with, or are inconsistent with, GAAP in connection with
such determination, the terms of this Agreement (including **_Exhibit A_**)
shall control.

  

## Section 2.16. _Dissenting Shares_.

  

### (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of the capital stock of BRINC that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and are held by Stockholders who have not voted in
favor of, or consented in writing to, the Merger and who have exercised and
perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance

   

26   

 

  

### with and complied in all respects with Section 262 of the
DGCL (collectively, the " **Dissenting Shares** ") shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be
cancelled and cease to exist and the holder or holders of Dissenting Shares
shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to them under Section
262 of the DGCL. All Dissenting Shares held by Stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their right
to appraisal of such shares under the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

  

### (b) BRINC shall give Kenexa Technology prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by BRINC, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by BRINC;
provided that if any such demands, withdrawals or other related instruments
are received by the Surviving Corporation or the Parent after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and/or the Parent shall give such notice to
the Representative rather than to Kenexa Technology. After the Effective
Time, the Representative shall direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time,
BRINC shall not, except with the prior written consent of Kenexa Technology
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
settle any such demands. After the Effective Time, the Representative shall
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the DGCL, but shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Kenexa Technology which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands. If, as a result of any
settlement or a determination, any Stockholder is entitled to receive as
payment for his or its shares of Common Stock, Series C Preferred Stock,
Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock or Series F
Preferred Stock in an amount that exceeds the Common Stock Per Share
Merger Consideration, **** Series C Consideration, Series D Consideration,
Series E Consideration or Series F Consideration, respectively, (the
aggregate of such excess payments with respect to all Dissenting Shares is
referred to as the " **Dissenting Shares Reduction Amount** "), then Kenexa
Technology and the Representative shall provide joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to deliver from the Indemnity Escrow Account to the
Surviving Corporation by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated in writing by the Surviving Corporation, an amount
equal to the Dissenting Shares Reduction Amount.

contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with its terms and conditions.
In the event that any such party shall fail to obtain any such approval or
consent described in _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ hereof, such party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any actions

     

   



  

## reasonably requested by Kenexa Technology, to minimize any adverse effect
upon Parent, Kenexa Technology, Acquisition Sub and their
Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, BRLLC, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries) resulting, or which could
reasonably be expected to result after the Effective Time, from the failure
to obtain such approval or consent.

  

## Section 6.8. _Additional Agreements; Reasonable Efforts_.  Subject to the
terms and conditions herein provided, each of the Parent, Kenexa Technology,
Acquisition Sub, BRINC and BRLLC agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions and to do or cause to be
done all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Laws or otherwise to consummate and make effective this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) contesting any legal
proceeding seeking to enjoin the Transactions and (ii) executing
any additional instruments necessary to consummate this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
If at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary to

action as is commercially reasonable.

  

## Section 6.9. _Employee Benefits_. Parent or Kenexa Technology will provide,
or will cause BRLLC, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to provide to the employees of BRLLC, BRINC or any of their
respective Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the " **Affected
Employees** "), for the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on
December 31, 2006, with base salary and employee benefits (not including any
equity or bonus plans or programs) which in the aggregate are at least
substantially comparable to those currently provided by BRLLC, BRINC or any
of their respective Subsidiaries to their employees (not including any equity
or bonus plans or programs); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that with respect to
severance, in the event that Parent or Kenexa Technology amends or causes the
Surviving Corporation to amend its severance policy after the Effective Time
but on or before December 31, 2006 (any such amended policy being referred to
as an " **Amended Severance Policy** "), any such Amended Severance
Policy shall provide that the severance benefit shall be on the same terms
and conditions to which an Affected Employee may be eligible under the
BRINC severance policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement and shall
not be less than the severance benefit to which such Affected Employee would
have been eligible under the BRINC severance policy in effect as of the date
of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that to the extent that
any federal, state or local law, including, without limitation, so called
"plant closing" laws, requires Parent, Kenexa Technology or the Surviving
Corporation to give advance notice or make a payment of any kind to an
Affected Employee because of such Affected Employees involuntary termination
due to a layoff, reduction in force, plant or facility closing, sale of
business, or similar event, the severance benefit shall be reduced by 60
calendar days of such Affected Employees base salary and benefits at the
date of termination of such Affected Employees employment by the Surviving
Corporation, but in no event shall such severance benefit be reduced below
zero. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, nothing contained herein
shall be construed as requiring Parent, Kenexa Technology, BRLLC, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of BRLLC or the Surviving Corporation
to continue any specific Employee Plan, including but not limited to any
BRINC severance policy, practice or other arrangement. Nothing in this
Agreement requires Parent, Kenexa Technology, BRLLC, the

     

   



  

## Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of BRLLC or the
Surviving Corporation to continue the employment of any specific Person after
the Effective Time.

  

## Section 6.10. _Public Announcements_. On and after the date hereof and
through the Effective Time, BRLLC, BRINC, the Selling Members and the
Accel Parties, on the one hand, and Parent, Kenexa Technology and Acquisition
Sub, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing any
press releases or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the parties
shall issue any press release or make any public statement prior to obtaining
the other parties written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, except that no such approval shall be necessary to the extent
disclosure is required by applicable Laws.

  

## Section 6.11. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, any Transaction Document, the Transactions
(including the Merger) or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Transaction Document, each of the parties hereto and their
respective boards of managers or directors shall (a) take all necessary
action to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and (b) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects
of such Takeover Statute.

  

## Section 6.12. _Financing_. The Parent, Kenexa Technology and
Acquisition Sub shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain any financing
necessary to enable the Parent, Kenexa Technology and Acquisition Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

## Section 6.13. _Section 280G_. Prior to the Closing Date, BRINC shall
submit to a stockholder vote the right of any "disqualified individual" (as
defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive any and all payments (or
other benefits) that could be deemed "parachute payments" under Section
280G(b) of the Code, in a manner that satisfies the stockholder approval
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and any regulations
promulgated thereunder. Consistent with the requirements of
Section 280G(b)(5) and the regulations, such vote shall establish the
"disqualified individuals" right to the payment, benefit or other
compensation, and before the Closing Date, BRINC shall provide adequate
disclosure to all stockholders of BRINC of all material facts concerning all
payments that, but for such vote, could be deemed "parachute payments" to a
"disqualified individual" under Section 280G of the Code in a manner that
satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and any regulations
promulgated thereunder.

  

## Section 6.14. _Termination of 401(k) Plan_. Prior to the Closing Date,
BRINC shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions that are necessary
or appropriate to terminate (including, without limitation, adoption by the

the Effective Time, any Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred
arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, including,
without limitation, the BrassRing, Inc. 401(k) Plan.

  

## Section 6.15. _Defense of Litigation_. Neither BRLLC nor BRINC shall

respective Subsidiaries to settle or offer to settle, any Action against
BRLLC, BRINC, any of their respective Subsidiaries or (if BRLLC,

     

   



  

## BRINC or any such Subsidiary is a party to such Action) any of
their respective managers, directors or officers by any Member of BRLLC
or Stockholder of BRINC arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written
consent of Kenexa Technology (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

BRLLC, BRINC, any Selling Member or any Accel Party shall give prompt written
notice to Kenexa Technology of (a) the existence or occurrence, or failure to
occur, of any fact or event of which it obtains actual knowledge that would
be reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of BRLLC, BRINC,
any Selling Member or any Accel Party contained in this Agreement or in any
other Transaction Document to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect
at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time assuming
such representation or warranty is made at such time; (b) the failure of
BRLLC, BRINC, any Selling Member or any Accel Party to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant to be complied with by it hereunder; (c)

Schedule. Following the Effective Time, for indemnification purposes

     

   



  

### under _Article X_ , the representations, warranties and covenants of
BRLLC, BRINC, the Selling Members and the Accel Parties shall be deemed to be
qualified by the Disclosure Schedule as supplemented or modified
in accordance with this _Section 6.17(b)_ at or prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.17(a)_ or this
_Section 6.17(b)_ , other than any supplement or modification resulting from
events in the Ordinary Course of Business, unless Parent or Kenexa Technology
consents in writing to any supplement to or modification of the Disclosure
Schedule in accordance with this _Section 6.17(b)_ or Parent, Kenexa
Technology and Acquisition Sub consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby by waiving the condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section
7.3(b)_ , as applicable, no supplement to or modification of the Disclosure
Schedules (i) shall be included for the purposes of determining whether the
conditions in _Section 7.3(a)_  or _Section 7.3(b)_ have been met, or (ii)
shall limit the rights and remedies of Parent, Kenexa Technology and
Acquisition Sub under _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Article X_.

  

### (c) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Kenexa Technology or Acquisition Sub
shall give prompt written notice to BRLLC, BRINC, the Selling Members and the
Accel Parties of (a) the existence or occurrence, or failure to occur, of any
fact or event of which it obtains actual knowledge that would be reasonably
likely to cause any representation or warranty of Parent, Kenexa Technology
or Acquisition Sub contained in this Agreement or in any other Transaction
Document to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from
the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time assuming such representation
or warranty is made at such time; (b) the failure of Parent, Kenexa

respect any covenant to be complied with by it hereunder; (c) any written
notice or other written communication from any Person alleging that the

negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person or group of
Persons (other than Parent, Kenexa Technology, Acquisition Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates) concerning any Alternative Transaction, or (ii)
enter into any agreement, letter of intent or memorandum of understanding
involving an Alternative Transaction or which could reasonably be expected to
result in BRLLC, BRINC or any of their respective Subsidiaries abandoning,
terminating or failing to consummate the Transactions (including the Merger)
and the other transactions contemplated hereby.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to obtaining the Requisite BRINC Vote, BRINC or BRLLC may
furnish non-public information concerning the business, properties or assets
of BRINC or BRLLC, a Subsidiary of BRINC or BRLLC or a division of BRINC or
BRLLC to another party and may engage in discussions or negotiations with
such party, if (A) BRINC or BRLLC receives from such party an unsolicited
bona fide written offer to acquire (whether by way of merger, consolidation,
share exchange, stock or unit purchase or asset purchase) all of the
outstanding capital stock or Units or all or substantially all of the assets
of BRINC or BRLLC,

   

68   

 

  

other than as a result of a breach of this _Section 6.15_ , and (B) the Board
of Directors of BRINC or the manager of BRLLC, as applicable, concludes,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the fiduciary duties of
the Board of Directors or the manager under applicable law require BRINC or
BRLLC to do so.

the Effective Time, and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified
Executive against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys

in settlement incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing,
to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law (and the Parent, Kenexa
Technology and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law, provided the
Indemnified Executive to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified
Executive is not entitled to indemnification).

  

### (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, BRLLC and BRINC shall obtain an
extended reporting period endorsement, or "tail coverage," with respect to
BRLLCs and BRINCs directors and officers liability insurance policy (a
copy of which has been heretofore delivered to the Parent), covering those
persons who are currently covered by such policy for claims against them in

Time (the " **D andO Tail**").

European Union, Kenexa Technology further agrees to satisfy the requirements
of Member State law on the protection of individuals with regard to the
processing and free movement of such EU Personal Data.

BRLLC, BRINC and any of their respective Subsidiaries required to be filed
(taking into account extensions) prior to the Closing Date. All Tax Returns

required by law. The Equityholders shall deliver each Final Tax Return to
Kenexa Technology no later than 45 days prior to the due date for filing such
Final Tax Return, for Kenexa Technologys review and approval. Kenexa
Technology shall be deemed to have approved a Final Tax Return unless it
delivers a written notice of disagreement to the Representative within 10
days of the receipt of such Final Tax Return. If Kenexa Technology delivers
a notice of disagreement, Kenexa Technology and the Representative will
negotiate in good faith to resolve the issues, but if they have not resolved
the issues within five (5) days of the Representatives receipt of the notice
of disagreement, the items of disagreement shall be submitted to the
Settlement Accountants for review, with instructions that no items shall be
resolved in the favor of the Representative unless the Settlement Accountants
advise, in writing, that the position of the Representative is more likely
than not to be accepted by the relevant Tax authority.

  

#### (ii) _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_.
Kenexa Technology and/or the Surviving Corporation shall prepare or cause to
be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of BRLLC, BRINC and

Technology and/or the Surviving Corporation shall permit the Representative
to review and comment upon such Tax Returns.

  

### (b) _Cooperation in Filing Tax Returns_. Kenexa Technology, the

information, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with
the filing of any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund,
determining liability for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes, or
in conducting any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect
to Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with relevant
accompanying schedules and relevant work papers, relevant documents relating
to rulings and other determinations by taxing authorities, and relevant
records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property, which any such
party may possess.  Each party will retain all Tax Returns, schedules, work
papers, and all material records and other documents in its possession
relating to Tax matters of BRLLC, BRINC and any of their respective
Subsidiaries for the Tax period first ending after the Closing Date and for
all prior Tax periods until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notice is provided with respect thereto, any
extensions thereof) for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other
documents relate. Each party shall make its employees reasonably available on
a mutually convenient basis at its cost to provide explanation of any
documents or information so provided.

  

### (c) _Allocation of Certain Taxes_.

  

#### (i) If BRLLC, BRINC or any of their respective Subsidiaries is permitted
but not required under applicable Tax laws to treat the Closing Date as the
last day of a taxable period, then the parties shall treat that day as the
last day of a taxable period.

  

#### (ii) In the case of any Taxes for a Straddle Period, the portion of such
Tax which relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing
Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes, other than Income Taxes, be deemed
to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire taxable period, and (ii) in the case of any Income Tax, be
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable
period ended as of the end of the Closing Date. All determinations necessary
to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner
consistent with the prior practice of BRLLC, BRINC and their respective
Subsidiaries.

  

### (d) _Payment of Transfer Taxes and Fees_. Kenexa Technology, on the one
hand, and the Equityholders, on the other hand, each shall pay one half of
all Transfer Taxes arising out of or in connection with the transactions
effected pursuant to this Agreement and Kenexa Technology and the
Equityholders shall file all necessary documentation and Tax Returns
with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

  

### (e) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any and all Tax allocation
or sharing agreements or other agreements or arrangements binding BRLLC,
BRINC or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of the
day before the Closing Date and, from and

respective Subsidiaries shall be obligated to make any payment to any Person
pursuant to any such agreement or arrangement for any past or future period.

the Equityholders, Kenexa Technology will promptly notify the Representative

issue for which the Kenexa Indemnified Parties are not entitled
to indemnification hereunder, Parent, Kenexa Technology and their
Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, BRLLC, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries) shall have the sole right, at
their expense, to conduct the contest and/or settlement of such issue, and
(ii) with respect to any such issue for which the Kenexa Indemnified Parties
may be entitled to indemnification from the Equityholders hereunder, the
Representative shall have the sole right, at the Equityholders expense, to
conduct the contest and/or settlement of such issue; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any settlement would materially impact a Tax Return of Parent, Kenexa
Technology or any of their Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time,
BRLLC, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries) with
respect to any period beginning after the Closing Date, Kenexa Technology and
the Representative shall mutually agree on the terms of such settlement.

  

## Section 9.5. _No Recourse Against Customers_. In the event any taxing
authority shall assess any sales, goods and services or other similar Taxes,
or in the event any Kenexa Indemnified Party shall submit a claim
for indemnification with respect to such Taxes hereunder, the Equityholders
shall have no recourse against, and no Equityholder shall seek reimbursement
from, the customers of BRLLC, BRINC or their respective Subsidiaries with
respect to which such Taxes shall have been assessed, _provided_ , _however_
, that the Kenexa Indemnified Parties shall use commercial reasonable efforts
to seek reimbursement for such Taxes from the customer before
seeking indemnification under this Agreement.

  

## Section 9.6. _Miscellaneous_. During the period from the date of
this Agreement to the Effective Time, BRLLC, BRINC shall promptly notify
Kenexa Technology of any Action or audit pending or threatened against BRLLC,

BRLLC or BRINC permit any of its respective Subsidiaries to make, revoke,
adopt or change, any material Tax election or Tax accounting method without

delayed).

claims described in clauses (A) through (D) of _Section 10.2(c)_ shall first

### Indemnity Escrow Account; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent
that the aggregate distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Account for any
such claims (" **Fundamental Representation Distributions** ") diminish the
Indemnity Escrow Amount so that the Indemnity Escrow Amount is insufficient
to satisfy other claims by the Kenexa Indemnified Parties which are otherwise
limited to the Indemnity Escrow Amount, then: (i) in the case of any claims
pursuant to clauses (A) through (C) of _Section 10.2(c)_ , the limitation to
the Indemnity Escrow Amount set forth in _Section 10.2(c)_ shall not apply to
limit the amount payable to the Kenexa Indemnified Parties by any

the limitation to the Indemnity Escrow Amount set forth in _Section 10.2(c)_
shall not apply to limit the amount payable to the Kenexa Indemnified Parties
severally by the Equityholders to the extent (but only to the extent) of any
Fundamental Representation Distributions for which the Equityholders are
severally liable.

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 10.2(c)_ or

parties, but shall also include Damages incurred or sustained by a Kenexa

hereto will be liable to another party hereunder for any punitive,
consequential, incidental or special damages, including loss of revenue or
income, diminution in value, business interruption, cost of capital or loss
of business reputation or opportunity, relating to any claim for which such
party may be entitled to recover under this Agreement other than damages
relating to a claim for actual fraud of such party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that for the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes payable by a Kenexa Indemnified
Party (for purposes of this proviso only, "Kenexa Indemnified Party" includes
BRINC, BRLLC and their respective Subsidiaries) as the result of a
misrepresentation or breach of warranty contained in _Section 3.13_ shall
constitute Damages for purposes of this _Article X_ ; provided, further that
if a Kenexa Indemnified Party makes such a claim for Damages, the Kenexa
Indemnified Parties shall provide the Equityholders Representative with
reasonable access to the Tax books and records of BRLLC, BRINC and the

contrary, no Kenexa Indemnified Party or its successors or assigns shall have

Damages relating to any matter arising under the provisions of this Agreement
to the extent that any such Kenexa Indemnified Party or its successors and
assigns had already recovered Damages with respect to the same matter
pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement.

     

   



  

### (h) Any payments made pursuant to _Article IX_ or this _Article X_
shall constitute an adjustment to the Net Enterprise Value for Tax purposes
and shall be treated as such by the parties hereto and the Surviving
Corporation on their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by law.

  

## Section 10.3. _Limitation on Indemnity_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Equityholders shall not be liable under _Article IX_  or
this _Article X_ unless and until (i) with respect to claims
for indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)(xiii)_ , the aggregate Damages for
which the Equityholders would otherwise be liable under this _Article X_
exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) with respect to any one Off-the Shelf
Software License (at which point the Equityholders shall become liable for
the aggregate Damages with respect to any one such Off-the Shelf Software
License and not just amounts which exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000)) or
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) with respect to all Off-the-Shelf Software
Licenses in the aggregate (at which point the Equityholders shall become

($50,000)), and (ii) with respect to all other claims for indemnification
under _Article IX_ or this _Article X_ , the sum of the Negative Adjustment

## Section 10.4. _Notice of Claims_.

  

### (a) Any Kenexa Indemnified Party seeking indemnification hereunder shall,
within the limitation period provided for in _Section 10.1_ above, give to
the Representative, a written notice (a " **Claim Notice** ") describing in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claims for indemnification
hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount
or the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to
the provision of this Agreement or any agreement, certificate or instrument
executed pursuant hereto or in connection herewith upon which such claim is
based; _provided_ , that a Claim Notice in respect of any action at law or
suit in equity by a third Person as to which indemnification will be sought
shall be given promptly after the action or suit is commenced; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that failure to give such written notice shall not relieve
the Equityholders of their obligations hereunder, except to the extent they
shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure.

  

### (b) The Equityholders, acting through the Representative, shall have
thirty (30) days after the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto to (i)
agree to the amount or method of determination set forth in the Claim Notice
or (ii) provide such Kenexa Indemnified Party with written notice that it
disagrees with the amount or method of determination set forth in the Claim
Notice (the " **Dispute Notice** ").  Within fifteen (15) days after the
giving of any Dispute Notice, the Representative and the Kenexa Indemnified
Party shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the matter. In the event
that the controversy is not resolved within thirty (30) days of the giving of
the Dispute Notice, the parties shall thereupon proceed to pursue any and
all available remedies at law. If the Representative agrees to the Claim
Notice pursuant to clause (i) above or fails to provide a timely Dispute
Notice pursuant to clause (ii) above, then the

     

   



  

### Kenexa Indemnified Party shall be entitled to receive from the Indemnity
Escrow Account the amount set forth in the Claim Notice, and
Kenexa Technology and the Representative shall promptly execute a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release such amount to such
Kenexa Indemnified Party.

  

### (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this _Section 10.3_
shall not apply in the case of a Claim Notice provided in connection with a
claim by a third Person made against a Kenexa Indemnified Party, which claims
are provided for by _Section 10.6_.

  

## Section 10.5. _Mitigation; Exclusivity of Remedy_. Upon any Kenexa
Indemnified Party becoming aware of any claim as to which indemnification may
be sought by such Kenexa Indemnified Party pursuant to _Article IX_ or this
_Article X_ , a Kenexa Indemnified Party shall utilize all reasonable
efforts, consistent with normal practices and policies and good commercial
practice, to mitigate such Damages.  From and after the Effective Time, the
remedies in _Article IX_ and this _Article X_ shall be the exclusive remedies
of the parties with respect to any and all matters covered by _Article IX_ or
this _Article X_ (as applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this _Section 10.5_ , no party hereto shall be deemed to have waived any
rights, claims, causes of action or remedies if and to the extent such
rights, claims, causes of action or remedies may not be waived under
applicable law, or actual fraud, intentional misrepresentation or active
concealment is proven on the part of a party by another party hereto, and
such rights, claims, causes of action or remedies shall not be limited to the
Indemnity Escrow Account.

  

## Section 10.6. _Third Person Claims_. If a claim by a third Person is made
against a Kenexa Indemnified Parties, and if such party intends to seek
indemnity with respect thereto under this _Article X_ , such Kenexa
Indemnified Parties shall promptly notify the Representative in writing of
such claims, setting forth such claims in reasonable detail. The
Equityholders, acting through the Representative, shall have fifteen (15)
days after receipt of such notice to undertake through counsel of their own
choosing and at their own expense, the conduct of the settlement or defense
thereof, and if the Equityholders so undertake, then they will control such
settlement and defense and the Kenexa Indemnified Parties shall cooperate
with the Equityholders in connection therewith; _provided_ , that the Kenexa
Indemnified Parties may participate in such settlement or defense through
counsel chosen by such Kenexa Indemnified Parties and paid at its own
expense; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if in the reasonable opinion of
counsel for such Kenexa Indemnified Parties, there is a reasonable likelihood
of a conflict of interest between the Equityholders and the Kenexa
Indemnified Parties, the Equityholders shall be responsible for the
reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to Kenexa Indemnified Parties in
connection with such defense. So long as the Representative is reasonably
contesting any such claim in good faith, the Kenexa Indemnified Parties shall
not pay or settle any such claim without the consent of the Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Representative does
not notify the Kenexa Indemnified Parties in writing within fifteen (15) days
after receipt of the Kenexa Indemnified Parties written notice of a claim
of indemnity hereunder that the Equityholders are electing to undertake
the defense thereof, the Kenexa Indemnified Parties shall have the right
to undertake, at the Equityholders cost, risk and expense, the
defense, compromise or settlement of the claim, but shall not thereby waive
any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement.  Subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Section 10.6_ , the Equityholders shall pay
the Kenexa Indemnified Parties reasonable,

     

   



  

## documented expenses as and when incurred, provided that until the General
Survival Date, such expenses shall first be paid out of the Indemnity Escrow
Account to the extent of funds available therein. The Representative shall
not, except with the consent of the Kenexa Indemnified Parties, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, enter into any
settlement or consent to entry of any judgment that (a) does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person or Persons asserting
such claim to all Kenexa Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release from
all Liability with respect to such claim, (b) involves non-monetary relief
or remedy, including any restrictions on the Kenexa Indemnified Parties
ability to operate or compete, or (c) exceeds the remaining amount in
the Indemnity Escrow Account.

  

## Section 10.7. _Calculation of Damages_. The amount of any Damage for
which indemnification is provided shall be (a) net of any reserves or current
liabilities included in the final determination of Closing Working Capital,
(b) net of any amounts recovered by the Kenexa Indemnified Party under
insurance policies with respect to such Damages and (c) computed after taking
into account all Tax consequences to the Kenexa Indemnified Party of (i) the
receipt of (or the right to receive) the indemnification payment and (ii) the
event or the incurrence of the liability that has given rise to the right to
receive the indemnification payment.  Thus, it is the intention of the
parties that the Kenexa Indemnified Party be held harmless with respect to
the liability that gave rise to the indemnification payment on an after-Tax
basis.  In the event that any claim for indemnification asserted hereunder
is, or may be, the subject of any insurance coverage or other right to
indemnification or contribution from any third Person, the Kenexa Indemnified
Party expressly agrees to promptly notify the applicable insurance carrier of
any such claim or loss and tender defense thereof to such carrier, and shall
also promptly notify any potential third party indemnitor or contributor
which may be liable for any portion of such losses or claims. The Kenexa
Indemnified Party agrees to pursue such claims diligently and to
reasonably cooperate with each applicable insurance carrier and third party
indemnitor or contributor. The Kenexa Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to seek recoveries under insurance policies
and shall reimburse the Equityholders for any Damage indemnified by the
Equityholders, which is subsequently recovered by the Kenexa Indemnified
Party under any such insurance.

  

## Section 10.8. _Appointment of the Representative_.

  

### (a) The Selling Members and the Accel Parties hereby appoint and, in the
event that the Merger is approved by the Requisite BRINC Vote, effective upon
the Requisite BRINC Vote and without the further act of any Person, the other
Stockholders and Optionholders shall be deemed to have appointed, the
Representative as each Equityholders true and lawful attorney-in-fact and
agent to execute in the name and on behalf of such Equityholder the Escrow
Agreement and to make all decisions with respect to the defense and/or
settlement of any claims for which a Kenexa Indemnified Party may claim to be
entitled to indemnity under _Article IX_ or this _Article X_ and with respect
to disbursements from the Indemnity Escrow Account. The Representative shall
not have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in
this Agreement, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities,
duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or shall
otherwise exist against the Representative.

     

   



  

### (b) Each Equityholder that accepts payment of any consideration in
respect of the Transactions as contemplated herein shall be deemed, by such
acceptance of payment, or by his, her or its execution of a Letter of
Transmittal, or by the approval of this Agreement, as the case may be, to
have agreed that the provisions of _Article IX_ or this _Article X_ shall be
binding upon such Equityholder and the successors and assigns of such
Equityholder.

  

### (c) In addition, each Equityholder that accepts payment of any
consideration in respect of the Transactions as contemplated herein shall be
deemed, by such acceptance of payment, or by his, her or its execution of the
Letter of Transmittal, or by the approval of this Agreement, as the case may
be, to have acknowledged and agreed that neither he, she or it nor any of
his, her or its respective Affiliates will have any claims or rights to
contribution or indemnity from Parent, Kenexa Technology, Acquisition Sub,
BRLLC, BRINC, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the respective Affiliates of the foregoing Persons
with respect to any amounts paid by any Equityholder pursuant to _Article IX_
or this _Article X_ or any liabilities that such Equityholder may have for
actual fraud, _provided_ , that nothing contained in this _Section 10.8(c)_
shall be deemed to constitute a waiver or release by any Person of any rights
to indemnification from BRLLC, BRINC or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
the DGCL, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, the Operating Agreement
or the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of BRINC or any applicable
policy of director and officer liability insurance.

  

### (d) The Representative shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any statements furnished to it by any
Equityholder, Parent, Kenexa Technology or Acquisition Sub, or any other
evidence deemed by the Representative to be reliable. The Representative
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing or take any action under this
Agreement unless it shall have received such advice or concurrence of the
Equityholders as it deems appropriate or unless it shall have been expressly
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Equityholders severally against any
and all liability and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action. The Representative shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or refraining from acting, under this Agreement
in accordance with a request of Equityholders who have a right to receive
a majority of the Net Enterprise Value paid to the Equityholders, and
such request, and any such action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto,
shall be binding upon all of the Equityholders.

  

### (e) The Representative shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or
any action taken or omitted to be taken hereunder except in the case of its
intentional wrongdoing for personal benefit. The Representative shall be
entitled to consult with counsel of its choosing and shall be fully protected
in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by it in good faith in accordance
with the advice of counsel.

  

### (f) The Representative shall not be paid any fee for services to be
rendered hereunder. The Representative shall be reimbursed from the
Indemnity Escrow Account for up to $35,000 of all reasonable fees and
expenses incurred by the Representative in performing its duties hereunder
(including under _Sections 2.14_ and _2.17_ and  _Articles IX_ and _X_ ) or
under the Escrow Agreement and thereafter by the Equityholders for all such
reasonable fees and expenses in excess of $35,000.

     

   



  

### (g) The Equityholders, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold
the Representative harmless against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable costs of
investigation, attorneys fees, and disbursements that may be imposed on the
Representative or incurred by the Representative in connection with the
performance of its duties under this Agreement, including any litigation
arising from this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or involving their
subject matter, unless such loss, liability, claim or expense shall have been
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be a result of the
Representatives intentional wrongdoing or for personal benefit. Except in
the case of fraud by an Equityholder, such Equityholders liability under
_Article IX_  or this _Article X_ shall not exceed the portion of the Net
Enterprise Value received by such Equityholder pursuant to this Agreement.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall
the Representative be liable to the Equityholders for special, indirect or
consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including lost profits),
even if the Representative has been advised of the likelihood of such damages
and regardless of the form of action.

  

### (h) The Representative may resign at any time.  The Representative may
be removed at any time by a writing signed by Equityholders who have the
right to receive a majority of the Net Enterprise Value paid or payable to
the Equityholders.  If the Representative or any successor shall resign, be
so removed, or become unable to act as the Representative, a replacement
shall promptly be appointed by a writing signed by Equityholders who have the
right to receive a majority of the Net Enterprise Value paid or payable to
the Equityholders. The Representative shall promptly notify Kenexa Technology
and the Escrow Agent of any such resignation, removal or appointment.

  

### (i) Parent, Kenexa Technology, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on the actions taken by the
Representative, and that each action taken by the Representative shall be
binding on each of the Equityholders as if such action had been performed by
each such Equityholder. The Equityholders, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Kenexa Indemnified Parties and the Escrow
Agent from and against any losses that any Kenexa Indemnified Party or the
Escrow Agent may suffer, sustain or become subject to as the result of any
claim by any of the Equityholders that an action taken by the Representative
purportedly on behalf of the Equityholders pursuant to the authorization in
_Article IX_ or this _Article X_ is not binding on or enforceable against any
of the Equityholders.

  

## Section 10.9. _Disbursements from the Escrow Account_. If any Kenexa
Indemnified Party shall be entitled, upon completion of any applicable
dispute resolution procedures set forth in _Article IX_ or this  _Article X_
, to recover any amounts from the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to this
Agreement, Kenexa Technology and the Representative shall promptly provide a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver such amounts to
Kenexa Technology (or any Person designated by Kenexa Technology). If, after
the General Survival Date, there are any amounts remaining in the Indemnity
Escrow Account, then each Equityholder shall be entitled to receive his, her
or its pro rata share (in proportion to his, her or its allocated portion of
the Indemnity Escrow Amount as set forth in the Equityholder Allocation
Statement) of such amounts, and Kenexa Technology and the Representative
shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver such
amounts, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to

     

   



  

## an account, in the name of Parent, as agent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if prior to the General Survival Date, the Representative has received one or
more Claim Notices which set forth indemnification claims under _Article IX_
or this _Article X_ for Damages that are unresolved on the General Survival
Date, then an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the amount of the aggregate
Damages claimed in, and reasonably expected to be incurred in connection
with, each such unresolved Claim Notice, or (b) the amount remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Account, shall continue to be held by the Escrow Agent in
the Indemnity Escrow Account to pay such claims and any other amounts
associated therewith that are payable pursuant to _Article IX_ or this
_Article X_ ; and _provided further_ , from time to time promptly after final
resolution of each such indemnification claim set forth in any such Claim
Notice, the Representative and Kenexa Technology will authorize the Escrow
Agent to disburse all amounts remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account to
Parent, as payment agent, in the same manner as described above, subject
to the condition that if at such time there remains unresolved any claim
for Damages described in any Claim Notice, an amount equal to the lesser
of (i) the amount of the aggregate Damages claimed in, and
reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with, each such Claim Notice
or (ii) the amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account shall
be maintained in the Indemnity Escrow Account.  Kenexa Technology and the
Representative shall direct and cause Parent, as payment agent, to transmit
to each Equityholder his, her, or its pro rata share (in proportion to his,
her or its allocated portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount as set forth in
the Equityholder Allocation Statement) of any amounts paid by the Escrow
Agent to Parent, as payment agent, pursuant to the second sentence of
_Section 10.9_ promptly upon receipt of such amounts by Parent.
