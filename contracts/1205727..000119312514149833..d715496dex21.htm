the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their
respective stockholders, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled
Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into and shall thereafter represent
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $10.00 (such amount of cash
hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the
holder thereof, without interest, in accordance with Section 3.02. The
parties agree that the sum of (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration
(excluding with respect to shares of Company Restricted Stock issued in
accordance with Section 6.01(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter) and (ii)
the aggregate Option Consideration will not exceed $323,426,610.00 plus the
aggregate of the exercise prices of any Company Options exercised after the
Capitalization Date and prior to or on the Closing Date (the "
_Aggregate Merger Consideration Cap_ "). In the event the Aggregate Merger
Consideration Cap would be exceeded, the Merger Consideration will be adjusted
accordingly.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common
Stock converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article 3
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") and each holder of a non-certificated share of
Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_
"), in each case outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock, shall thereafter cease
to have any rights with respect to such securities, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest.

(c) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall
occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon
with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or stock dividend
thereon.

(d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned
directly by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective

 



14  Time or held in treasury of the Company (in each case, other than any such
Company Common Stock held on behalf of Third Parties) (the " _Cancelled
Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof
and shall cease to exist and no payment shall be made in respect thereof.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.02 Surrender and Payment.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust
company (the identity of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company)
to act as Paying Agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment
of (i) the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time represented by a
Certificate and each Book-Entry Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, in each case, other than the Cancelled Shares and except for
any Dissenting Shares and (ii) the Option Consideration payable by the Paying
Agent pursuant to Section 3.05. Concurrently with the Effective Time and
subject to Section 3.05(a), Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with
the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration and Option Consideration required to be paid by the
Paying Agent in accordance with this Agreement (such cash shall be referred to
in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to make the payments in connection with the Merger
Consideration contemplated by Section 3.01 or the Option Consideration
contemplated by Section 3.05, Parent shall promptly deposit or cause to be
deposited additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal
to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Paying
Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 3.01 and the
Option Consideration contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 3.05 out of
the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the third Business Day following the Effective Time,
Parent will cause the Paying Agent to send to each holder of record of a
Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of
Company Common Stock (other than the Cancelled Shares and except for any
Dissenting Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) to the Paying Agent) in such form as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree, for use in effecting delivery of shares of Company Common
Stock to the Paying Agent, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(c) Upon the later of the Effective Time and surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with a letter of transmittal duly

 



15  completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay in exchange therefor as
promptly as practicable, the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions
of this Article 3, and the Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
appropriate amount of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying
Agent) and as a condition to such payment the Person requesting such payment
shall pay, or cause to be paid, any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or
an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article
3. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry
Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time
(or at any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares shall be so converted)
be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of
each such Book-Entry Share, the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be
paid or accrue on any cash payable to holders of Book-Entry Shares.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company
(" _DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 2:00 p.m.
Eastern time on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its
nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds
equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock held of record by DTC or
such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger
Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the Closing
occurs after 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will
transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first Business Day after the Closing
Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC
Payment. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the DTC Payment.

(f) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Applicable Law.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Paying Agent,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article 3.

 



16 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock or holders of Company Options after the date
which is one year following the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent
upon demand. Any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has not
exchanged his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.02 and any holder of a Company
Option who has not received the Option Consideration in accordance with
Section 3.05 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
delivery of the Merger Consideration or Option Consideration in respect of
such holders shares of Company Common Stock or Company Options.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Options for any Merger Consideration or Option Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by
shares of Company Common Stock at such time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority will
become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent or
its designee, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(h) All Merger Consideration or Option Consideration issued and paid upon
conversion of the Company Common Stock or the Company Options, respectively,
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company
Common Stock or Company Options, as the case may be.

(i) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Section 3.02 to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for
which appraisal rights shall have been perfected shall be returned to Parent
upon demand.

 

Section 3.03 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this
Article 3.

Section 3.04 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment pursuant to the Code or
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



17 Section 3.05 Treatment of Company Compensatory Awards.

 

(a) Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option
that is outstanding and unexercised shall (i) vest in full, and (ii) by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration less the exercise
price per share of such Company Option, subject to any applicable withholding
or other Taxes required by Applicable Law to be withheld in accordance with
Section 3.04 (the " _Option Consideration_ "). Each holder of an outstanding
Company Option shall be entitled to receive in exchange for the cancellation
thereof the Option Consideration, if any, with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock subject to such outstanding Company Option and Parent
shall cause such payment to be made to the holder of such Company Option, if
a current or former employee of the Company, through the payroll system of the
Surviving Corporation or, if not a current or former employee of the Company,
through the Paying Agent, in each case, payable as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date (and, in the case of current or former employees of
the Company, in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run
of the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date). For the avoidance
of doubt, if the exercise price per share of any Company Option, whether
vested or unvested as of the Effective Time, is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, then by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders thereof, the Company Option will automatically terminate and be
cancelled without payment of any consideration to the holder thereof.

 

(b) Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time,

 

(i) except as provided in Section 6.01(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
each share of Company Restricted Stock the vesting of which is time-based
shall automatically become fully vested and the restrictions thereon shall
lapse; and

(ii) each Company Restricted Stock Award the vesting of which is performance-
based shall automatically become fully vested, and the restrictions thereon
shall lapse, with respect to that number of shares of Company Restricted Stock
subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award determined based on the
achievement of the applicable performance goals set forth in such Company
Restricted Stock Award, as measured at the Effective Time in accordance with
the terms of such Company Restricted Stock Award, and any remaining unvested
shares of Company Restricted Stock shall be immediately forfeited without
payment of any consideration to the holder thereof.

 

(c) Not less than ten days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall send
a written notice in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent to each holder of
an outstanding Company Option or Company Restricted Stock Award that shall
inform such holder of the treatment of the Company Options and Company
Restricted Stock Awards provided in this Section 3.05.

 



18 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions
that are necessary for the treatment of Company Compensatory Awards as set
forth in Section 3.05.

 

(e) Following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Compensatory Award or
any participant in any Company Stock Plan, or other Company Employee Plan or
employee benefit arrangement of the Company or under any employment agreement
shall have any right hereunder to acquire any capital stock or other equity
interests (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.06 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock as to which
the holder thereof shall have (i) not voted in favor of the Merger, (ii)
properly complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as to demand
appraisal rights and (iii) not effectively withdrawn or lost its rights to
appraisal (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), if any, such Dissenting Shares
shall not be converted into a right to receive any portion of the Merger
Consideration and the holders thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as
are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who
becomes entitled to payment for such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) if any holder of
Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance
with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) the right to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (y) if any holder
of Dissenting Shares fails to establish his, her or its entitlement
to appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL or (z) if any holder of
Dissenting Shares takes or fails to take any action the consequence of which
is that such holder is not entitled to payment for his, her or its shares
under Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock held by
such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall thereupon cease to
constitute Dissenting Shares, and each such share of Company Common Stock
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, thereafter be
deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive, without interest thereon, the Merger
Consideration. The Company will give Parent reasonable notice of all written
notices received by the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. Without
the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment.
From and after the Effective Time, no holder of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to vote his, her or its Dissenting Shares for any purpose or receive
payment of dividends or other distributions with respect to his, her or its
Dissenting Shares (except dividends and distributions payable to stockholders
of record at a date which is prior to the Effective Time).

Documents that such disclosure is relevant to a particular Section of this
Article 4 (it being understood that this clause (ii) shall not be applicable
to Section 4.02 or Section 4.05), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub:

Section 4.01 Corporate Existence and Power.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in

The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and,
where such concept is recognized, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in

the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Section 4.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of the Companys Subsidiaries, each of which (i) has

Material Adverse Effect; and (iii) has all corporate or equivalent power and
authority required to carry on its business as currently conducted.

authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement, this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by

Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any other applicable U.S. state or
federal securities, takeover or "blue sky" laws, (vi) compliance with any

Company Material Adverse Effect, or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or to consummate the Transactions.

 

Section 4.04 Non-Contravention. Except as set forth on Section 4.04 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the execution, delivery and performance by the

Transactions do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with or result in

of its Subsidiaries (the "Leased Real Property"). Except as set forth on
Section 4.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, (i) the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries has a valid and enforceable leasehold estate in, and enjoys
peaceful and undisturbed possession of, all Material Leased Real Property,
subject to the Enforceability Exceptions and any Permitted Liens, (ii)
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects
performed all obligations required to be performed by it under each Contract
in respect of Material Leased Real Property, and (iii) as of the date of this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any written
notice from any lessor of such Material Leased Real Property of, nor does the
Company have Knowledge of the existence of, any default, event or circumstance
that, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by
the party that is the lessee or lessor of such Material Leased Real Property.

 



26 Section 4.13 Intellectual Property.

 

(a) Section 4.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter accurately identifies as
of the date hereof each material item of Registered IP owned by any Acquired
Company and the jurisdiction in which such item of Registered IP has been
registered or filed and the applicable application, registration, or serial or
other similar identification number and any other Person that has
an ownership interest (other than a Permitted Lien) in such item of
Registered IP. To the Knowledge of the Company, each material item of
Registered IP is valid and subsisting and (except for applications)
enforceable. To the Knowledge of the Company, the Acquired Companies have
made all filings and payments and taken all other actions required to be made
or taken to maintain each material item of Registered IP.

 

(b) The Acquired Companies exclusively own all right, title and interest to
and in the Company IP free and clear of any Liens (other than Permitted Liens
and non-exclusive licenses granted by the Acquired Companies in the ordinary
course). Except as set forth in Section 4.09(a)(vi) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, no Acquired Company has granted any exclusive right to use
any material Company IP to any Person. The Acquired Companies have a policy
requiring each Person who is or was an employee, officer, director, consultant
or contractor of any Acquired Company and who is or was involved in the
creation or development of any Company IP to sign an agreement containing (i)
an assignment to the applicable Acquired Company of all Intellectual Property
Rights in such Persons contribution to the Company IP, and (ii) non-
disclosure obligations for the protection of trade secrets of the Acquired
Companies.

(c) To the Knowledge of the Company, each of the Acquired Companies owns
or otherwise has the right to use all Intellectual Property Rights which are
material to the conduct of business of the Acquired Companies as currently
conducted, taken as a whole, and are used in, held for use in, or necessary
for the conduct the business of the Acquired Companies as currently
conducted.

(d) To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Acquired Companies
are currently infringing or misappropriating any Intellectual Property Right
of any other Person. No material claims of infringement, misappropriation, or
similar claim involving Intellectual Property Rights of another Person or
related Proceeding or investigation is pending or to the knowledge of the
Company threatened against any Acquired Company. No Acquired Company has from
January 1, 2012 through the date hereof, received any written notice alleging
infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property Right of
another Person.

(e) The Acquired Companies take commercially reasonable measures to protect,
safeguard and maintain the confidentiality of all material proprietary
information which is owned by an Acquired Company and which the Acquired
Companies hold as a trade secret.

 

Section 4.14 Insurance Coverage. The Company has made available to Parent true
and complete copies of all material insurance policies and all material self-
insurance programs and arrangements relating to the business, assets and
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Insurance Policies_ ").
Each of the Insurance Policies is in full force and effect, all premiums due
thereon have been paid in full and the Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with the terms and conditions of such
Insurance Policies. There is no claim in excess of $250,000 by any
Acquired Company pending under any of the Insurance Policies as to which
coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed. No Acquired Company has
received written notice of any pending or threatened cancellation with respect
to any Insurance Policies.

 



27 Section 4.15 Regulatory Matters.

 

(a) Except as set forth on Section 4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
and except with respect to licenses, approvals, consents, registrations and
permits required under applicable Environmental Laws (as to which certain
representations and warranties are made pursuant to Section 4.18), the Company
and its Subsidiaries hold all material permits, approvals, authorizations,
certificates, registrations and licenses issued by the FCC or the state public
service or public utility commissions or other similar state regulatory bodies
(" _State PSCs_ "), and all other material regulatory permits, approvals,
licenses and other authorizations, including franchises, ordinances and other
agreements granting access to public rights of way, issued or granted to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by a Governmental Authority (the "
_Company Licenses_ ") that are required for the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries to conduct its business, as presently conducted, except where the
failure to hold Company Licenses has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect or materially impair the ability of the Company to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions.

 

(b) Each Company License is valid and in full force and effect and has not
been suspended, revoked, cancelled or adversely modified, except where the
failure thereof to be in full force and effect, or the suspension, revocation,
cancellation or modification thereof, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. No Company License is subject to (i) any conditions or
requirements that have not been imposed generally upon licenses in the same
service, unless such conditions or requirements are set forth on the face of
the applicable authorization or would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) any pending proceeding by or before
the FCC or State PSCs to suspend, revoke or cancel such Company License, or
any judicial review of a decision by the FCC or State PSCs with respect
thereto, unless such pending proceeding or judicial review has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect or materially impair the ability of the
Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions. To the Knowledge of the Company, there has not been any event,
condition or circumstance that would preclude any Company License from being
renewed in the ordinary course (to the extent that such Company License is
renewable by its terms), except where the failure thereof to be renewed would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
materially impair the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions.

(c) The licensee of each Company License is in compliance with such Company
License and has fulfilled and performed all of its obligations with respect
thereto, including all reports, notifications and applications required by the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Communications Act_ "), or the
rules, regulations, written policies and orders of the FCC (together with the
Communications Act, the " _FCC Rules_ ") or similar state telecommunications
laws (the " _State Telecommunications Laws_ ") and the rules, regulations,
written policies and orders of State PSCs (collectively with the State
Telecommunications Laws, the, " _PSC Rules_ "),

 



28  and the payment of all regulatory fees and contributions, except (i) for
exemptions, waivers or similar concessions or allowances and (ii) where such
failure of such licensee to be in compliance, fulfill or perform its
obligations or pay such fees or contributions has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or materially impair the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions.

(d) Section 4.15(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all
material regulatory permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates,
registrations and licenses issued or granted to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by the FCC or any PSC, in each case, that constitute Company
Licenses, together with the name of the entity holding such Company License.
The Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company directly or indirectly
owns one hundred percent (100%) of the equity interests and controls one
hundred percent (100%) of the voting power and decision-making authority of
each licensee of the Company Licenses, except where the failure to own such
equity or control such voting power and decision making authority of such
licensees has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. No
Company License, order or other agreement, obtained from, issued by or
concluded with any State PSC would impose restrictions of the ability of any
Subsidiary of the Company to make payments, dividends or other distributions
to the Company or any other Subsidiary that limits, or would reasonably be
expected to limit, the cash funding and management alternatives of the
Company on a consolidated basis in a manner disproportionate to restrictions
applied by other State PSCs.

 

Section 4.16 Tax Matters. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect,

(a) all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to an Acquired
Company have been timely filed (taking into account any extension of time
within which to file) and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete
in all respects; no Acquired Company is currently the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return;

(b) all Taxes of each Acquired Company (whether or not shown to be due and
payable on any Tax Return) have been timely paid (other than Taxes being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate
reserves have been established on the Company Financial Statements in
accordance with GAAP);

 

(c) no deficiency for any amount of Taxes has been proposed, asserted or
assessed, in each case, in writing by any Governmental Authority against any
Acquired Company that remains unpaid;

(d) there are no audits, examinations or other Proceedings ongoing or pending
with respect to any Taxes of any Acquired Company;

(e) there are no waivers or extensions of any statute of limitations currently
in effect with respect to Taxes of any Acquired Company (other than
extensions that arise as a result of filing Tax Returns by the extended due
date therefor);

 



29 (f) all Taxes required to be withheld or collected by an Acquired Company have
been withheld and collected and, to the extent required by Applicable Law,
timely paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority;

(g) there are no Liens for Taxes upon any property or assets of any Acquired
Company, except for Liens for current Taxes not yet delinquent that may
thereafter be paid without interest or penalty, and Liens for Taxes being
contested in good faith by (if then applicable) appropriate proceedings and
for which adequate reserves have been established on the Company Financial
Statements in accordance with GAAP;

 

(h) in the last two years, no Acquired Company has been a party to any
transaction treated by the parties as a distribution to which Section 355 of
the Code applies;

(i) no Acquired Company (i) has been a member of an affiliated group (within
the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code) filing a United States
consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than the affiliated group of
which the Company is the common parent), (ii) has any liability for the Taxes
of any other Person (other than another Acquired Company) under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law or as a transferee or successor or by Contract or otherwise;
or (iii) is a party to any Tax sharing agreement, in the case of clauses (ii)
and (iii), other than pursuant to any Contracts or agreements not primarily
related to Taxes; and

 

(j) no Acquired Company has engaged in a listed transaction within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

 

Section 4.17 Employees and Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(a) Section 4.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate
and complete list identifying each material "employee benefit plan," as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, each material employment, severance or
similar Contract and each other plan or arrangement (written or oral)
providing for compensation, bonuses, commission, profit-sharing, stock
option or other stock related rights or other forms of incentive or deferred
compensation, vacation benefits, insurance (including any self-insured
arrangements), health or medical benefits, employee assistance program,
disability or sick leave benefits, workers compensation, supplemental
unemployment benefits, severance benefits, change of control payments, post-
employment or retirement benefits and other time-off benefits (including
compensation, pension, health, medical or life insurance benefits) which is
maintained, administered or contributed to by any Acquired Company or any
ERISA Affiliate and covers any employee or former employee of any Acquired
Company, or with respect to which such Acquired Company has any liability,
other than governmentally administered plans and plans mandated by Applicable
Law. Such plans are referred to collectively herein as the " _Employee
Plans_." Except as set forth in Section 4.17(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there are no stock option, restricted stock or other stock related
Employee Plans other than the Company Stock Plans.

(b) No Acquired Company or any ERISA Affiliate (nor any predecessor thereof)
maintains, contributes to, or has any obligation with respect to, or has in
the preceding six years maintained, contributed to, or had any obligation with
respect to any pension plan subject to Title

 



30  IV of ERISA or Section 412 or Section 430 of the Code, any multiemployer
plan, as defined in Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, a multiple employer
plan, as defined in Section 413(c) of the Code, or a multiple employer
welfare arrangement, as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA.

(c) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate a Company Material Adverse Effect, each
Acquired Company (i) has performed all obligations required to be performed by
such Acquired Company under each Employee Plan established or maintained for
the benefit of any employee or service provider (or former employee or service
provider) who performs services in the United States of America (the " _U.S.
Employee Plans_ ") and (ii) is not in default with respect to or in violation
of, and has no Knowledge of any default or violation by any other party to,
any U.S. Employee Plan. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate a Company Material Adverse
Effect, each U.S. Employee Plan has been established and maintained in
accordance with its terms and in compliance with Applicable Law, including
ERISA and the Code. Each U.S. Employee Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter (or, in the case of an Employee Plan that is maintained
pursuant to the adoption of a master or prototype or volume submitter plan
document, the sponsor of the master or prototype or volume submitter document
has obtained from the IRS an opinion letter to the effect that the form of
such document is acceptable for the establishment of a qualified retirement
plan), or has pending or has time remaining in which to file, an application
for such determination from the IRS, and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
there is no reason why any such determination (or opinion) letter should be
revoked or not be reissued.

 

(d) Except as provided in this Agreement or as required by Applicable Law, and
except as set forth in Section 4.17(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
consummation of the Transactions will not (either alone or together with any
other event, including a subsequent termination of employment or services)
entitle any current or former employee or independent contractor of
any Acquired Company to severance pay or accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or trigger any payment of funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Employee Plan
(including any acceleration of vesting with respect to a Company Compensatory
Award held by employees of an Acquired Company as a result of the Transaction
or any termination of employment in connection therewith). Except as set
forth in Section 4.17(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, no payment or
benefit (including vesting of Company Compensatory Awards) that will or may be
made by any Acquired Company or their ERISA Affiliates to any current or
former employee or other service provider of any Acquired Company is
reasonably expected to be characterized as a "parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. There is no Contract by which
any Acquired Company is bound to compensate any employee for excise Taxes
paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.

(e) Except as set forth on the Company Balance Sheet or as set forth in
Section 4.17(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, no Acquired Company or ERISA
Affiliate has any current or projected liability in respect of post-retirement
health, medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current
employees of any Acquired Company or any ERISA Affiliate, except as required
under Section 4980B of the Code or under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA or except for the continuation of coverage through the end of the
calendar

 



31  month in which termination from employment occurs. No condition exists that
would prevent any Acquired Company or any ERISA Affiliate from amending or
terminating any Employee Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA in accordance with its terms.

(f) No Acquired Company is a party to or bound by, or is currently
negotiating in connection with entering into, any collective bargaining
agreement or other labor-related contract or arrangement with a labor union,
works council or similar organization. There are no labor unions or other
organizations representing, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, purporting to
represent or attempting to represent, any employee of the Acquired Companies,
nor has any such action or attempt occurred within the past three
years. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
labor strike, dispute, walkout, work stoppage, slowdown or lockout with
respect to employees of the Acquired Companies, and no such strike, dispute,
walkout, slowdown or lockout has occurred within the past three years. Except
as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Acquired Company is
in compliance with all Applicable Laws regarding employment, employment
practices, terms and conditions of employment, employment safety and health,
immigration, wages and hours, and employee-independent contractor
classification, and with respect to employees each Acquired Company (i) is
not liable for any arrears of wages, severance pay or any Taxes or any
penalty for failure to comply with any of the foregoing and (ii) is not liable
for any payment to any trust or other fund governed by or maintained by or on
behalf of any Governmental Authority, with respect to unemployment
compensation benefits, social security or other benefits for employees (in
each case, other than routine payments to be made in the normal course of
business, and not yet overdue, and consistent with past practice). There are
no pending, or the Knowledge of the Company, threatened Proceedings or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, investigations, pertaining to employment or
employment practices between any Acquired Company and any of its respective
current or former employees, in each case, as would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Acquired Companies are in
compliance in all material respects with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Act of 1998, as amended.

(g) No Acquired Company has engaged in any transaction with respect to any
Employee Plan that would be reasonably likely to subject any Acquired Company
to any Tax or penalty (civil or otherwise) imposed by ERISA, the Code or other
Applicable Law that could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. There do not exist any pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened Proceedings (other than routine claims for benefits) with
respect to any Employee Plan that could reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(h) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, each
Employee Plan or other Contract to which one of the Acquired Companies is a
party and that is a "non-qualified deferred compensation plan" (as such term
is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) (i) has, at all times since the
adoption of Section 409A of the Code, been administered in all material
respects in good-faith compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code and applicable guidance issued thereunder, (ii) has been, since
the later of (A) January 1, 2009 and (B) such Employee Plans or Contracts
inception date, in a written form that complies with, and has been

 



32  administered in compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and the final
regulations promulgated and in effect thereunder, and (iii) no amount under
any such plan or arrangement is or has been subject to the interest and
additional Tax set forth under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any other Acquired Company has any obligation to gross-up or
indemnify any individual with respect to any such Tax. 

Section 4.18 Environmental Matters. Except as set forth on Section 4.18 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Company and its Subsidiaries are and at all
times since January 1, 2012 have been in compliance with, and are not and have
not been in default under or in violation of any Environmental Laws, except
for any such instance of non-compliance that has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Section 4.18 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company and its Subsidiaries hold all permits required
under applicable Environmental Laws to permit the Company and its Subsidiaries
to operate their assets in a manner in which they are now operated and
maintained and to conduct the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted, except where the absence of any such permit has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Section
4.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this Agreement,
there are no written claims or notices of violation pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, issued to or threatened, against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries alleging violations of or liability under any
Environmental Law, except for any such claim or notice that has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. This Section 4.18 provides the sole
and exclusive representations and warranties of the Company in respect of
environmental matters, including any and all matters arising under
Environmental Laws.

 

Section 4.19 Information in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement (and any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto) at the date mailed to the Companys
stockholders and at the time of any meeting of the Companys stockholders to
be held in connection with the Merger, and at the time of any amendments
thereof or supplements thereto, will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to
statements therein based on information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement. Any financial projections or forward-looking
statements in the Proxy Statement will be prepared by the Company in good
faith. The Proxy Statement (and any amendment thereof or supplement thereto)
will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act and any other applicable federal securities laws.

Section 4.20 No Brokers. Except for UBS Securities LLC (the " _Company
Financial Advisor_ "), there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other
financial intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who might be entitled to any
fee or commission from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the Transactions.

 



33 Section 4.21 Networks.

 

(a) Section 4.21(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the
date hereof, the following information related to the network of the Company
and its Subsidiaries: (i) a list of all switch locations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and (ii) maps that depict generally the fiber routes operated
by the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Network Facilities_
"). The Network Facilities described in Section 4.21(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, taken as a whole, are in all material respects in good
operating condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted. With respect
to each Network Facility, except as set forth on Section 4.21(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, to the Knowledge of the Company, any notices or
other actions required to be taken to renew the term of such Network Facility
for any upcoming renewal term have been taken or given in the manner and
within the time provided in such Network Facility agreement or contract (or
the time period provided for giving of such notice or to undertake such action
has not expired) to effectively renew the term of such Network Facility
agreement or contract for the upcoming term thereof to the extent that such
Network Facility agreement or contract is renewable by its terms and the
Company or its applicable Subsidiary intends to renew such Network Facility
agreement or Contract. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred, or circumstance exists, that, but for the
passage of time or giving of notice, would preclude any Network Facility
agreement or Contract from being renewed in accordance with the terms thereof
to the extent the Company or its applicable Subsidiary intends to renew such
Network Facility agreement or contract. Each of the Network
Facilities described in Section 4.21(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter is
free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), subject, however, to
the terms of the agreements or contracts pursuant to which such Network
Facilities were acquired. 

(b) Section 4.21(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists, as of the date
hereof, material interconnection agreements entered into pursuant to Sections
251 and 252 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the " _Telecommunications
Act_ ") in the states of California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Texas and Washington which represent the highest revenue-producing states for
the Companys and its Subsidiaries regulated businesses, including amendments
to implement the FCCs Triennial Review Remand Order, to the extent such
amendments have been adopted (the " _Interconnection Agreements_ "), between
the Company or its Subsidiaries and the largest incumbent local exchange
carriers in such states. All Interconnection Agreements include the general
terms, conditions and pricing for any unbundled network elements (" _UNEs_
"), collocation or other network facilities or services provided under
Sections 251 and 252 of the Telecommunications Act.

 

Section 4.22 Personal Property. Except as has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company owns and has good
title to all of its personal property and has valid leasehold interests under
enforceable leases in all of its leased properties, in the case of each of
the foregoing, free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens.

Section 4.23 Opinion. The Company Board has received an opinion from the
Company Financial Advisor to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion
and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth in
such opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of shares of
Company Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of
this Agreement.

 



34 Section 4.24 Takeover Statutes. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations contained in Section 5.07, the Company Board has taken all
necessary actions so that the restrictions applicable to business combinations
contained in the Takeover Statute are, and will be, inapplicable to the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement.

Section 4.25 No Additional Representations or Warranties. Except as provided
in this Article 4, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates, nor any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, partners,
members or other Representatives has made, or is making, any representation or
warranty whatsoever to Parent or Merger Sub or their Affiliates and no such
party shall be liable in respect of the accuracy or completeness of any
information provided to Parent or Merger Sub or their Affiliates.

Section 5.01 Corporate Existence and Power. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all corporate power
and authority required to carry on its business as currently conducted. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and, where such concept is recognized, is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so

Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions.

Section 5.02 Corporate Authorization. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution, delivery and performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of Parent and Merger Sub (subject, with respect to Merger Sub, only to
approval by its sole stockholder), and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of Parent and Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or for each of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State). Assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, this
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

 

Section 5.03 Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the

Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, (ii) compliance with Antitrust
Laws, (iii) receipt of the FCC Consents, (iv) receipt of the PSC Consents,

would not materially impair or delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Transactions or perform their respective obligations under
this Agreement on a timely basis. Parent does not have Knowledge of any facts
(including with respect to the direct or indirect ownership of Parent) that
would materially impair, delay or preclude Parents ability to obtain any FCC
Consents or PSC Consents.

Section 5.04 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement, the consummation by each of
Parent or Merger Sub of the Transactions and the compliance by each of Parent
or Merger Sub with any of the provisions of this Agreement does not and will
not (i) contravene, conflict with or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the Charter Documents of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) assuming the
consents, approvals, authorizations and compliance with the matters referred
to in Section 5.03 have been received and any condition precedent to such
consents, approvals, authorizations and compliance has been satisfied,
conflict with or result in a violation of breach of any Applicable Law nor
(iii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.03,
require any consent by any Person under, constitute a default, or an event
that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default, under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation,
acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the loss of any
benefit to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any
Contract, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such violation,
breach, default, right, termination, amendment, acceleration, cancellation or
loss that would not materially impair or delay the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to consummate the Transactions or perform their respective obligations
under this Agreement on a timely basis.

Section 5.05 Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, lawsuits, actions, suits,
claims or other proceedings at law or in equity or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, investigations before or by any Governmental Authority against Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to materially
impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions or
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement on a timely basis.
There is no unsatisfied judgment or any open injunction binding upon Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to materially
impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions or
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement on a timely basis. 

Section 5.06 No Brokers. Except for Lazard Freres and Co LLC, there is no
investment banker, broker, finder or other financial intermediary that has
been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of any of Parent or its
Subsidiaries who might be entitled to any fee or commission from Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions. 

 



36 Section 5.07 Ownership of Company Capital Stock.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries do not
beneficially own (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities of the
Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company Common
Stock or other securities of, or any other economic interest (through
derivative securities or otherwise) in, the Company.

(b) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any agreement,
arrangement, understanding or other Contract, or authorized, committed or
agreed to enter into any agreement, arrangement, understanding or other
Contract, (i) with respect to the acquisition, disposition, voting or holding
of Company Common Stock with any beneficial owner thereof or any Affiliates of
any beneficial owner (other than this Agreement) or (ii) pursuant to which:
(A) any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration
of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration, (B) any
stockholder of the Company (x) agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the
Merger or (y) agrees to vote against, or not to tender its shares of Company
Common Stock in, any Acquisition Proposal or (C) any third party has agreed to
provide, directly or indirectly, equity capital to Parent or the Company to
finance in whole or in part the Merger.

 

Section 5.08 Financial Resources.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies
(provided that the associated fee letter has been redacted with respect to
customarily redacted fee and "market flex" terms) of Debt Commitment Letters
to provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in an
aggregate amount set forth therein (being collectively referred to as
the "Financing"). As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letters have not been amended, modified, withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in
any respect, and do not contain any material misrepresentation by Parent. As
of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letters, in the form so
delivered, are in full force and effect and are legal, valid and binding
obligations of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions, and no event has occurred
which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach thereunder on the part of Parent or Merger
Sub. No amendment or modification to, or withdrawal, termination or
rescission of, any of the Debt Commitment Letters is contemplated. Parent has
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the
Debt Commitment Letters that are payable on or prior to the date of
this Agreement and will pay all additional fees as and when they become due.
As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing would not reasonably be
expected to be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing would not
reasonably be expected to be available to Parent and Merger Sub on the date on
which the Closing should occur pursuant to Section 2.01. As of the date of
this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of any party to
the Debt Commitment Letters under any term or condition of the Debt Commitment
Letters or that would, individually or in the aggregate, permit the financial
institutions party thereto to terminate, or to not make the funding of the
facilities to be established thereunder upon satisfaction of all conditions
thereto; provided that Parent is not making any representations in this
Section 5.08 regarding the effect of the inaccuracy of any of the
representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement. Neither
Parent nor Merger Sub has incurred any 

 



37  obligation, commitment, restriction or liability of any kind, and neither of
them is contemplating or aware of any obligation, commitment, restriction or
liability of any kind, in either case which would reasonably be expected to
materially impair or adversely affect the Financing. The aggregate proceeds
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, together with available cash of
Company and Parent, will be sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation to complete the Transactions, and to satisfy all of the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement, including (x)
paying the Merger Consideration at Closing, (y) effecting the repayment
or refinancing of all Indebtedness of the Company as of the Closing Date, if
necessary, and (z) paying all related fees and expenses (collectively, the
"Financing Purposes"). Except for the fee letters referred to in the Debt
Commitment Letters, as of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other
agreements, contracts, arrangements or understandings related to the funding
of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the applicable Debt
Commitment Letters. The fee letters between Parent and the Financing Sources
included in the Debt Commitment Letters do not contain any conditions
precedent or other contingencies (x) related to the funding of the full amount
of the Financing or any provisions that could reduce the aggregate amount of
the Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters or the aggregate
proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (other than by increase
in upfront fees or original issue discount to the extent that, after such
increase, the aggregate proceeds will still be sufficient to fund the
Financing Purposes) or (y) that could otherwise adversely affect the
conditionality, enforceability or availability of the Debt Commitment Letters
with respect to all or any portion of the Financing.

(b) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.02(a),
Section 8.02(b) and Section 8.02(c), each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will, after giving effect to all of the Transactions, including
any financing transactions entered into in connection with the Transactions
and the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Option Consideration, be
Solvent at and immediately after the Effective Time. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " means that, as of any date of determination
and with respect to any Person: (a) the sum of the debt (including contingent
liabilities) of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, does not
exceed the present fair saleable value of the present assets of such Person
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (b) the capital of such Person and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is not unreasonably small in relation to
the business of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and (c)
such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, do not have debts
including current obligations beyond their ability to pay or refinance such
debts as they mature in the ordinary course of business; _provided_ ,
_however_ , for the purposes hereof, the amount of any contingent
liability at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in light of all
of the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount
that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability
(irrespective of whether such contingent liabilities meet the criteria for
accrual under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 5).

Section 5.09 Information in the Proxy Statement. The information supplied by
Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (and
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) will not, at the date mailed to
the Companys stockholders and at the time of the meeting of the Companys
stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 



38 Section 5.10 Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities. All of the
outstanding equity interests of Merger Sub are owned directly by Parent.
Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in connection with its
formation and the Transactions, Merger Sub has not and will not prior to the
Effective Time have incurred, directly or indirectly, any obligations or
liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type or kind
whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any Person.

 

Section 5.11 Management Arrangements. As of the date hereof, except as
previously disclosed to the Company, none of Parent or Merger Sub, or their
respective executive officers, directors or affiliates, has entered into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding with any of the executive officers,
directors or affiliates of the Company that is currently in effect or
would become effective in the future (upon consummation of the Merger or
otherwise) and that would be required to be disclosed under Item 1005(d) of
Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.12 No Outside Reliance. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Article 5 or any other provision hereof, each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates,
nor any of its or their respective Representatives, has made, or is making,
any representation or warranty whatsoever, express or implied (and
neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied on any representation, warranty or
statement of any kind by the Company or any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives), beyond those expressly given in Article 4,
including any implied warranty or representation as to condition,
merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular purpose or trade as
to any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any cost
estimates, financial or other projections or other predictions that may be
contained or referred to in the Company Disclosure Letter or elsewhere, as
well as any information, documents or other materials (including any such
materials contained in any "data room" or reviewed by Parent or any of its
Affiliates, agents or representatives pursuant to the Confidentiality
Agreement) or management presentations that have been or shall hereafter be
provided to Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives are not and
will not be deemed to be representations or warranties of the Company, and no
representation or warranty is made as to the accuracy or completeness of any
of the foregoing except as may be expressly set forth in this Agreement.
Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub understands and agrees that any inventory, equipment, vehicles,
assets, properties and business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
are furnished "as is", "where is" and, subject only to the representations
and warranties contained in Article 4, with all faults and without any other
representation or warranty of any nature whatsoever.

Section 6.02 No Solicitation.

 

(a) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall, and shall cause its

their Representatives to, (x) cease and cause to be terminated any existing
solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Third Party
that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, and (y) request

the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their Representatives not to, (i) solicit,
initiate, or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiry, discussion, offer
or request that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any non-public information

Law, waive, terminate, modify or release any Person (other than Parent, Merger
Sub and their respective Affiliates) from any provision of or grant any
permission, waiver or request under any "standstill" or similar agreement or
obligation. Subject to Section 6.02(c), from and after the date hereof until
the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
in

 



42  accordance with Article 9, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives not
to (A) approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, or publicly propose to
approve, endorse, recommend or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or other similar agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "); or (B) take any action to exempt any Third Party
from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in the Takeover
Statute or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.02(a), if
at any time following the date hereof and prior to adoption of this Agreement
by the Required Company Stockholder Approval (i) the Company has received a
written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party that did not result from a
breach of this Section 6.02 and (ii) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, a Superior Proposal, then the Company may (x) furnish non-public
information to such Third Party and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations
with such Third Party with respect to the Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
that (A) prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from
the Third Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) any
non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries made
available to any Third Party shall, to the extent not previously made
available to Parent, be made available to Parent as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in no event later than twenty-four hours) after it is made
available to such Third Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in Section 6.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company, its
Subsidiaries and its Representatives may, in any event, contact any Third
Party to seek to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any
inquiry or proposal made by such Third Party solely to determine whether such
written Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal.

 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.02(c), neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, change, amend, modify or
qualify, or otherwise propose publicly to withdraw, change, amend, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation; (ii)
fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; or
(iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal made or received after the date hereof (any of the
actions described in clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 6.02(c), an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or (iv) cause or permit the Company to
enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of
the Required Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board shall be
permitted, subject to compliance with Section 6.02(d), (x) to terminate this
Agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition
Agreement and/or (y) to effect any Adverse Recommendation Change, if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
and outside legal advisors, that failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

(d) The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(h)
unless and until (i) the

 



43  Company has provided written notice (a " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") to Parent that the Company intends to take such action, which
notice includes, as applicable, (x) written notice of the material terms of
the Superior Proposal which enabled the Company Board to make the
determination that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, or (y) in
the case of any Adverse Recommendation Change that is not related to a
Superior Proposal, a reasonably detailed summary of the basis of such action,
(ii) during the three Business Day period following Parents receipt of the
Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent
in good faith (unless Parent indicates in writing that it has no desire to so
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change
would no longer be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law; and (iii) following the end of the three Business Day period,
the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial and outside legal advisors, taking into account any changes
to this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by Parent in response to the
Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change or otherwise, that the Superior
Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal and/or, as applicable, in the case of any
Adverse Recommendation Change that is not related to a Superior Proposal,
that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would still be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. In the event of
any material amendment of such Superior Proposal or any material change to the
facts and circumstances relating to the Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company shall be required to issue a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation
Change or otherwise comply again with the requirements of this Section
6.02(d); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for purposes of this sentence,
references to the three Business Day period above shall be deemed to be
references to a two Business Day period.

 

(e) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within one
Business Day) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
non-public information or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with written notice
of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, and the identity of the person or group of persons making any such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. In addition, the Company shall
provide Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within
one Business Day) with written notice setting forth all such information as
is reasonably necessary to keep Parent reasonably informed in all material
respects of all oral or written communications regarding, and the status and
material details (including material amendments or proposed material
amendments) of, any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i)
taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with respect to
a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Companys stockholders), (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication
to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (iii) any other communication to the Companys stockholders if
(in the case of this clause (iii)) the Company Board has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law.

 



44 Section 6.03 Access to Information. Subject to confidentiality obligations
and similar restrictions that may be applicable to information furnished to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by Third Parties that may be in the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries possession from time to time, and except
for any information that is subject to attorney-client privilege or other
privilege from disclosure, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours, in such manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the
normal operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to their respective
properties, books, Contracts, commitments, Tax Returns, records and
appropriate officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
shall furnish Parent and its Representatives with existing financial and
operating data and other information concerning the affairs of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as such Representatives may reasonably request;  _provided_
, that such investigation shall only be upon reasonable notice and shall be at
Parents sole cost and expense; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and its
Representatives shall not be permitted to perform any environmental sampling
at any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property, including sampling of
soil, groundwater, surface water, building materials, or air or wastewater
emissions. All information obtained by Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Representatives shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective Representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Parent in integration planning (including data systems
migration) to the extent permissible under Applicable Law; _provided_ , that
such efforts shall not be required to the extent they would unreasonably
interfere with the ordinary course operations of the business of the Acquired
Companies.

with obtaining any approval or consent related to any Applicable Law, Parent
shall cooperate in good faith with the Governmental Authorities and undertake
promptly any and all action required to complete lawfully the Transactions as
soon as practicable (but in any event prior to the End Date) and any and
all action necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the
actual or threatened commencement of any Proceeding in any forum by or on
behalf of any

 



46  Governmental Authority or the issuance of any Governmental Order that would

Transactions the absence of which would) delay, enjoin, prevent, restrain or
otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger, including (i) proffering
and consenting and/or agreeing to a Governmental Order or other agreement
providing for the sale, licensing or other disposition, or the holding
separate of, or other limitations or restrictions on, particular assets,
categories of assets or lines of business of the Acquired Companies and (ii)
promptly effecting the disposition, licensing or holding separate of assets
or lines of business of the Acquired Companies, in each case, at such time as
may be necessary to permit the lawful consummation of the Transactions on or
prior to the End Date, except if any of the aforementioned actions, either
individually or in the aggregate, is or would reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Parent shall be solely responsible for and pay all fees payable to the
Antitrust Authorities or with respect to FCC Submissions and PSC Submissions

Section 7.02 Proxy Statement.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC in
preliminary form a proxy statement relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting
(together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_
"). Except as contemplated by Section 6.02, the Proxy Statement shall include
the Company Board Recommendation with respect to the Merger. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC)
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall provide
Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on
the other hand. Each of the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of
the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts so that the Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto)
or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with
respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response (which comments
shall be provided promptly and be considered in good faith).

(b) Parent shall furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Merger Sub as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with
the Proxy Statement, including such information that is required by the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set
forth in the Proxy Statement, and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with
the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of
comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC). Parent will, upon request of
the Company, confirm and/or supplement the information relating to Parent or
Merger Sub supplied by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, such that at
the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or
supplements thereto, and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
such information shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

 



47 (c) Unless this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Article 9, the
Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, (x) establish a record
date for and give notice of a meeting of its stockholders, for the purpose of
voting upon the adoption of this Agreement (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ ") and (y) mail to
the holders of Company Common Stock as of the record date established for the
Company Stockholders Meeting a Proxy Statement (such date, the " _Proxy Date_
"). The Company shall duly call, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company may postpone, recess or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting with the consent of Parent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed: (i) for the absence of a quorum, (ii) to
solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Required Company
Stockholder Approval, or (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and distribution of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the
Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) is necessary under Applicable Laws and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by the
Companys stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that such postponement, recess or adjournment shall not exceed
thirty days in the aggregate. Unless the Company Board shall have effected an
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance
relating to the Company or Parent or any of the Companys or Parents
Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors, is discovered by the
Company or Parent, respectively, which, pursuant to the Exchange Act, should
be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, such
party shall promptly inform the others. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees to correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement which shall have become false or misleading.

 

Section 7.03 Confidentiality; Public Announcements. Without limiting any other
provision of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall consult
with the other and issue a joint press release with respect to the execution
of this Agreement. Thereafter, neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries, shall issue any press release or
other announcement (to the extent not previously publicly disclosed or made
in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to this Agreement, the
Transactions or any Acquisition Proposal without the prior consent of the
other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except (i) as such press release or other announcement may be
required by Applicable Law or the applicable rules of a national securities
exchange, in which case the party required to issue the release or make the
announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
release or announcement in advance of its issuance, (ii) that each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries may make announcements from time to time to
their respective employees, customers, suppliers and other business relations
and otherwise as the Company may reasonably determine is necessary to comply
with Applicable Law or the requirements of any agreement to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (iii) in connection with an Adverse
Recommendation Change if and to the extent permitted by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



48 Section 7.04 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees that it shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present
and former director, officer and employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred
in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, would have been permitted under Applicable Law and its respective Charter
Documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such person
(including promptly advancing expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under Applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries (i) to maintain
for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions
in its Charter Documents concerning the indemnification and exoneration
(including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the Companys and
its Subsidiaries former and current officers, directors, employees, and
agents that are no less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of the
Charter Documents of the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in each
case, as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) not to amend, repeal or
otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would adversely affect
the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by
Applicable Law. 

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect directors and officers
liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries directors and officers liability
insurance policies on terms not less favorable than the terms of such current
insurance coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Company may and (if
the Company does not) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause
coverage to be extended under the current directors and officers liability
insurance by obtaining at or prior to the Closing Date a prepaid, non-
cancelable six-year "tail" policy (containing terms not less favorable than
the terms of such current insurance coverage) with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) if any claim
is asserted or made within such six-year period, any insurance required to be
maintained under this Section 7.04 shall be continued in respect of such
claim until the final disposition thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no
event shall the annual cost of such policies exceed 250% of the last annual
premium paid therefor.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Section 7.04 shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and
shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation. In the event that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 7.04.

 

(d) Parent shall assume, and be jointly and severally liable for, and shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to honor, each of the covenants in
this Section 7.04.

 



49 Section 7.05 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such actions as are required to cause the disposition of Company
Common Stock, Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards or other
securities in connection with the Merger by each individual who is subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to the Company to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to
Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 7.06 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall keep Parent fully
informed on a current basis regarding any stockholder litigation against the
Company or its directors or officers relating to the Transactions, whether
commenced prior to or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement.
Without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company shall not voluntarily make any
material payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
stockholder litigation.

 

Section 7.07 Employee Matters.

 

(a) Following the Closing Date for the remainder of 2014, Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain for employees of the
Acquired Companies who continue in the employ of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Closing Date
(" _Continuing Employees_ "), (i) the same base salary as provided to
the Continuing Employees as of the date hereof, (ii) the Corporate Bonus Plan
identified in Section 4.17 of the Company Disclosure Letter; provided that in
making the annual determination of the bonus a Continuing Employee is eligible
to receive, (x) Parent shall utilize the performance goals in effect as of
the Effective Time to determine the pro rata portion of the bonus in respect
of the portion of calendar year 2014 ending on the last day of the calendar
month ending prior to the Closing, and (y) Parent may change the performance
goals used to determine the pro rata portion of the bonus attributable to the
portion of calendar year 2014 occurring from and after the last day of the
calendar month ending prior to the Closing, and (iii) employee benefits which
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to the
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries who are at comparable positions to
the Continuing Employees immediately prior to Closing. This Section 7.07
shall not limit the obligation of Parent to maintain any compensation
arrangement or benefit plan that, pursuant to an existing contract, must be
maintained for a period beyond December 31, 2014. No provision of this
Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of continued employment of any
Continuing Employee and this Agreement shall not be construed so as to
prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from having the right to terminate
the employment of any Continuing Employee, provided that any such termination
is effected in accordance with Applicable Law.

(b) From and after the Closing, Parent shall give each Continuing Employee
full credit for all purposes (including for purposes of eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, early retirement eligibility and early
retirement subsidies, vesting and benefit accrual, except for

 



50  benefit accrual purposes under any employee benefits plan of Parent that is
a defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plans,
arrangements, collective agreements and employment-related entitlements
(including under any applicable pension, 401(k), savings, medical, dental,
life insurance, vacation, long-service leave or other leave entitlements,
post-retirement health and life insurance, termination indemnity, severance
or separation pay plans) provided, sponsored, maintained or contributed to by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for such Continuing Employees service with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and with any predecessor employer,
to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits
for the same period of service.

 

(c) Parent shall (i) waive for each Continuing Employee and his or her
dependents, any waiting period provision, payment requirement to avoid a
waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively at work
requirement or any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full
participation under the welfare plans of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
applicable to such Continuing Employee to the extent such waiting period,
pre-existing condition limitation, actively at work requirement or other
restriction would not have been applicable to such Continuing Employee under
the terms of the welfare plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii)
give full credit under the welfare plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries
applicable to each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents for all co-
payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the same plan year
as the Closing, and for any lifetime maximums, as if there had been a single
continuous employer.

 

Section 7.08 Third Party Consents. The Company and its Subsidiaries will use
commercially reasonable efforts in connection with obtaining any consents,
authorizations or approvals required in order to consummate the Merger
pursuant to the terms of any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party so as to maintain and preserve the benefits under
such Contract as of the consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , that the
Company may not, without Parents written consent, make, or agree to make, any
material payments or material amendments, concessions or waivers in connection
therewith. 

Section 7.09 Notices of Certain Events. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify
the other parties of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that
would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Merger or any other Transaction not to be satisfied or
(b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with
or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be expected
to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the
Merger or any other Transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 7.09 shall not cure any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit
or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 



51 Section 7.10 Financing.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and Merger
Sub will use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, on a timely basis, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the
terms (including the "market flex" provisions) and conditions described in
the Debt Commitment Letters. Parent and Merger Sub will not permit any
amendment, supplement or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision, right or remedy under, the Financing Agreements without the
Companys prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, if such amendment, modification or waiver would (i) reduce (or would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of
the Financing, if the aggregate proceeds would not be sufficient to fund the
Financing Purposes, (ii) impose new or additional conditions, (iii) otherwise
amend, modify or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the Financing, in
the case of this clause (iii), in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub or
the Company, or (iv) otherwise expand, amend or modify any other provision of
the Debt Commitment Letters, in the case of this clause (iv), in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to (x) delay or prevent or make less likely the
funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the
Financing) on the Closing Date or (y) adversely impact the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against
other parties to the Financing Agreements, in each of clauses "(x)" and "(y)"
in any material respect. Subject to compliance with the other provisions of
this Section 7.10(a), Parent and Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment
Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the
date of this Agreement, and in connection therewith amend economic and
other arrangements with respect to the existing and additional lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities. In the event
of such amendment of the Debt Commitment Letters as permitted by the
immediately preceding sentence, the financing under such amended Debt
Commitment Letters will be deemed to be the "Financing" as such term is used
in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub will
use their reasonable best efforts to (1) maintain in effect the Debt
Commitment Letters (including any definitive agreements entered into in
connection therewith), (2) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions in the
Financing Agreements applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the
Financing, (3) provide to the Financing Sources, no later than May 31, 2014,
or sooner to the extent reasonably practicable, the information and materials
referred to in Section 5 of Exhibit B to the Debt Commitment Letters of even
date herewith (assuming timely compliance by Company with its obligations
hereunder in respect of delivery of Required Information), (4) cause the
Marketing Period to be concluded on or before the date of the last to occur
of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the obligations of Parties
set forth in Section 8.01(a), 8.01(b), 8.01(d) and 8.01(e), (5) negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letters
on the terms (taking into account "market flex" provisions) and conditions
contained in the Debt Commitment Letters, and other terms consistent with (but
in no event containing conditions or contingencies to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing not contemplated in) the Debt Commitment Letters
(such definitive agreements, together with the Debt Commitment Letters, the "
_Financing Agreements_ "), and promptly upon execution thereof provide
complete executed copies of such definitive agreements to the Company, (6)
comply in all material respects with each Financing Agreement, (7) enforce in
all material respects their rights under the Financing Agreements, and (8)
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Parent shall give the
Company prompt written notice (A) of any breach or default by

 



52  any party to any Debt Commitment Letter or other Financing Agreements of
which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (B) if and when Parent or Merger Sub
becomes aware that any portion of the Financing contemplated by any Debt
Commitment Letter may not be available for the Financing Purposes, (C) of the
receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Person
with respect to any (1) actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter or other Financing
Agreements or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any Debt Commitment Letter or other Financing Agreements (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with
respect to the terms of the Financing or Financing Agreements), and (D) of any
expiration or termination of any Debt Commitment Letter or other Financing
Agreements. Without limiting the foregoing, when reasonably requested by the
Company in writing, Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of their efforts
to arrange the Financing and provide to the Company copies of executed copies
of the definitive documents related to the Financing (provided that any fee
letters, engagement letters or other agreements that, in accordance with
customary practice, are confidential by their terms may be redacted so as not
to disclose such terms that are so confidential) and copies of any of the
written notices or communications described in the preceding sentence. If any
portion of the Financing becomes, or would reasonably be expected to become,
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the applicable
Financing Agreements (after taking into account flex terms), Parent will use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions
with terms and conditions not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to
Parent than the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable
Financing Agreements; provided that such alternative financing shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Company, be subject to any material
additional or modified conditions or other contingencies to funding than those
contained in the Debt Commitment Letters in effect on the date of this
Agreement (such alternative financing, " _Alternative Financing_ ") as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. In such event,
(1) the term "Financing" as used in this Agreement will be deemed to include
any such alternative debt financing, (2) the term "Financing" will be deemed
to include the Alternative Financing, (3) the term "Debt Commitment Letters"
will be deemed to include any commitment letters with respect to any such
alternative debt financing and (4) the term "Financing Agreements" will be
deemed to include any definitive agreement with respect to the Alternative
Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide notice to the Company promptly
upon receiving the Financing.

(b) From and after the date hereof until the earliest of (x) the Closing, (y)
the termination of this Agreement and (z) the date on which the Financing is
obtained, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to provide, and to
cause its Subsidiaries to provide, to Parent at Parents cost and expense,
and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their Representatives to
provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is customary and
necessary to permit Parent to arrange, obtain and syndicate the Financing and
cause the conditions in the Financing Agreements to be satisfied, including
(i) assisting with the preparation of offering and syndication documents and
materials, including information memoranda, lender presentations, rating
agency materials and presentations, and similar documents and materials, in
connection with the Financing, and providing reasonable and customary
authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution
of information to prospective lenders and containing customary information
(all such documents

 



53  and materials, collectively, the " _Offering Documents_ "); _provided_ ,
that the provision of financial or other information or data is addressed
solely by clause (ii) below, (ii) preparing and furnishing to Parent and the
Financing Sources, as promptly as practicable after it is requested, with all
Required Information and other information and disclosures relating to the
Company and as shall be reasonably requested by Parent to assist in
preparation of the Offering Documents; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Company shall not be required to prepare or furnish under this
Section 7.10(b) or otherwise, (A) pro forma financial statements, pro forma
financial information or pro forma adjustments, including those giving effect
to the consummation of the Merger, (B) any description of all or any component
of the Financing, including any such description to be included in any
liquidity or capital resources disclosure and any projections, risk factors or
other forward-looking statements relating to all or any component of the
Financing, or (C) any other information or statements customarily prepared by
the acquiror in like transactions, (iii) causing a member of senior management
of the Company to participate at reasonable times in a reasonable number of
presentations, due diligence sessions, and sessions with ratings agencies
in connection with the Financing, (iv) requesting the Companys independent
auditors to cooperate with Parents reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Financing, (v) assisting in the preparation of, and executing and
delivering, definitive financing documents, including guarantee and
collateral documents, hedging agreements, solvency certifications and other
certificates and documents as may reasonably be requested by Parent, (vi)
facilitating the pledging of collateral for the Financing, including taking
commercially reasonable actions necessary to permit the Financing Sources to
evaluate the Acquired Companies assets and cash management systems for the
purpose of establishing collateral arrangements and establishing, as of the
Effective Time, bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and
lockbox arrangements in connection with the Financing, (vii) using reasonable
best efforts to obtain from the Companys existing lenders customary payoff
letters, lien releases, and instruments of termination or discharge, and
(viii) cooperating with Parent to satisfy the conditions precedent to the
Financing to the extent within the control of the Acquired Companies;
provided, however, in each case, that (A) no obligation of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries under any certificate, document, agreement or instrument
(other than the authorization and representation letters referred to
above) will be effective until the Effective Time, (B) none of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee
or amount or incur any liability in connection with the Financing prior to the
Effective Time, (C) the pre-Closing Board of Directors of the Company and the
directors, managers and general partners of the Companys Subsidiaries shall
not be required to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and
instruments pursuant to which the Financing is obtained except such
resolutions of the directors, managers and general partners of the Companys
Subsidiaries as would not become effective until the Effective Time, (D) none
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to execute any
definitive financing documents, including any credit or other agreements,
pledge or security documents, or other certificates, legal opinions or
documents in connection with the Financing that become effective prior to the
Effective Time, (E) except as expressly provided above, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any corporate actions
prior to the Effective Time to permit the consummation of the Financing and
(F) Parent and Merger Sub shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries, and their respective pre-
Closing directors, officers and representatives, from and against any and
all damages incurred, directly or indirectly, in connection with the
Financing or any information provided in connection therewith. In connection
with the foregoing, the

 



54  Company will file with the SEC all quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly fiscal periods ending on and after March 31, 2014 not later than 45
days following the end of each fiscal quarter of the Company. The Company
hereby consents to the use of its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Financing; provided, however, that such logos are used solely in a manner that
does not harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company
will, upon request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to periodically
update any Required Information to be included in any Offering Document to be
used in connection with such Financing so that Parent may ensure that any such
Required Information does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained therein not misleading. Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company
and its Subsidiaries for all out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection
with such Financing cooperation.

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or before midnight on October 19, 2014 (subject to the proviso below, the "
_End Date_ "), whether such date is before or after the date of the receipt of
Required Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) each
of Parent and the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if any Governmental Order of a court of
competent jurisdiction enjoining or otherwise prohibiting prior to the

seeking to terminate this Agreement shall have used its reasonable best
efforts to resist, resolve or lift, as applicable, subject to the provisions

such meeting (and shall not have been adopted at any adjournment
or postponement thereof) by the Required Company Stockholder Approval;

Sub through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then, for a period of

such breach, but only as long as Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, continues to use its reasonable best efforts to cure such
Terminating Parent Breach (the " _Parent Cure Period_ "), such termination
shall not be effective and the End Date shall be automatically extended until
the end of the Parent Cure Period, and such termination shall become
effective only if the Terminating Parent Breach is not cured within the Parent
Cure Period;

 

(g) by Parent, if, prior to receipt of the Required Company Stockholder
Approval, an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred;  _provided_
that Parents right to terminate

(i) by the Company, if after the Marketing Period has ended, (x) all of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 have been

Section 8.03 for purposes of consummating the Merger and (z) Parent and Merger
Sub have failed to consummate the Closing prior to the earlier of one
Business Day prior to the End Date and three Business Days following delivery
of such written notice from the Company.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01
(other than pursuant to Section 9.01(a)) shall give a notice of such
termination to the other party setting forth a brief description of the basis
on which such party is terminating this Agreement.

Section 9.02 Effect of Termination. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Section 9.02 and Section 9.03, in the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party hereto or
its respective Affiliates, officers, directors or stockholders, other than
liability of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, for any
intentional and willful breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination. The provisions of Sections 7.03, 9.02, 9.03, Article 10 and the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

Section 9.03 Expenses; Termination Fees.

(a) Except as set forth in Section 7.01(e) and this Section 9.03, each party
hereto shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions whether or not such Transactions shall be consummated,
including all fees of its legal counsel, financial advisers and accountants;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the Transactions are not
consummated, Parent shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with any
financing arrangements, regardless of whether such financing fees and expenses
were to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



59 (b) If, but only if, this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) (x) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(b) and (y) (A) an
Acquisition Proposal has been made to the Company after the date hereof and
has not been withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement and (B)
within twelve months of the termination of this Agreement, the Company (1)
enters into a definitive agreement for the consummation of such Acquisition
Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated (regardless
of whether such consummation occurs within the twelve-month period) or (2)
consummates such Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay, or cause
to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee within one Business Day
after the date on which such Acquisition Proposal is consummated ( _provided_
, _however_ , that for purposes of this Section 9.03(b)(i), the references to
"twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)");

 

(ii) (x) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(d) and (y) (A) an
Acquisition Proposal has been made to the Company after the date hereof and
has not been withdrawn prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting
(including any adjournments and postponements thereof), (B) such Acquisition

to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee within one Business Day
after the date on which such Acquisition Proposal is consummated ( _provided_
, _however_ , that for purposes of this Section 9.03(b)(ii), the references
to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)");

 

(iii) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(g) or by the Company pursuant to
Section 9.01(h), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent
the Company Termination Fee (x) within three Business Days following such

termination pursuant to Section 9.01(h); or

 

(iv) by the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(f) or 9.01(i), then Parent shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company the Parent Termination Fee within
three Business Days following such termination.

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that
the agreements contained in Sections 9.02 and 9.03 are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub nor the Company would enter into this Agreement. The Company, Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that neither the Company Termination Fee
nor the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather each is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts
and resources

 



60  expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Merger. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event
shall the Company or Parent be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or
Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion, as applicable.

 

(d) Any amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.03(b) or this Section 9.03(d)
shall be paid by wire transfer of same day funds in accordance with this
Section 9.03 to an account designated by the receiving party at least one
Business Day prior to the date such fee is to be paid by Parent or the
Company, as applicable. If either the Company or Parent, as applicable,
fails to pay when due any amount payable under Section 9.03(b), and in order
to collect such amount, the party entitled to such payment commences a suit
that results in a judgment against the Company for the Company Termination Fee
or Parent for the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, then (i) the party
obligated to make such payment shall reimburse the other party for all
reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including fees and
disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with such suit and (ii) the
party obligated to make such payment shall pay to the other party interest on
such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date such overdue
amount is actually paid to Parent or the Company, as applicable, in full) at
the rate of interest per annum equal to the "Prime Rate" as set forth on the
date such payment became past due in The Wall Street Journal "Money Rates"
column.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 9.01(f) or 9.01(i), the
Companys receipt of the Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to
Section 9.03(b)(iv) and the payment of any amounts due pursuant to Section
9.03(d) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Acquired Companies
against (i)(A) Parent and Merger Sub and (B) any of Parents or Merger Subs
respective former, current and future Affiliates, assignees, stockholders,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys and
other Representatives (the Persons described in clauses (A) and (B),
collectively, the " _Parent Parties_ ") for any losses or damages arising from
or relating to this Agreement, any breach of any representation, warrant,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Transactions to
be consummated and (ii) any Financing Source Party arising from or related to
the Agreement, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Transactions to be
consummated.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01(b), Section 9.01(d),
Section 9.01(g) or Section 9.01(h), Parents receipt of the Company
Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to Section 9.03(b)(i)-(iii), as the
case may be, and the payment of any amounts due pursuant to Section 9.03(d)
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against (i)
(A) the Company and (B) any of the Companys former, current and future
Affiliates, assignees, stockholders, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employers, agents, attorneys and other Representatives (the Persons described
in clauses (A) and (B), collectively, the " _Company Parties_ ") for any
losses or damages arising from or relating to this Agreement, any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the
failure of the Transactions to be consummated and (ii) any Financing Source
Party for any losses or damages arising from or relating to this Agreement,
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or the failure of the Transactions to be consummated.

Section 10.02 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur, and that the parties would not
have any adequate remedy at law, in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy
to which any party is entitled at law or in equity. Each party agrees to waive
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with
such remedy. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties
hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company
shall be entitled to specific performance (i) to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of and to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement
(including Section 7.10(a)) by Parent and (ii) to cause Parent to consummate
the Transactions contemplated hereby including to effect the Closing in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement if
(A) all conditions in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied,
(B) Parent fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required
to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.01, (C) the Financing (or, if
Alternative Financing is being used in accordance with Section 7.10(a),
pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) has been funded or will be
funded at the Closing and (D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if
specific performance is granted and the Financing (or, if Alternative
Financing is being used in accordance with Section 7.10(a), pursuant to the
commitments with respect thereto) are funded, then the Closing will occur. In
furtherance of the foregoing, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent to enforce
the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters, including by demanding that Parent
file one or more lawsuits against the Financing Sources to fully enforce such
sources obligations thereunder and Parents rights thereunder if (i) all of
the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing), and Parent fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.01 and (ii) all of the
conditions to the 

 



63  consummation of the financing provided by the Debt Commitment Letters (or,
if Alternative Financing is being used in accordance with Section 7.10(a),
pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing). To the extent any party hereto brings an action, suit or proceeding
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (other than an action to enforce specifically any provision that
expressly survives termination of this Agreement), the End Date shall
automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth Business Day following
the resolution of such action, suit or proceeding or (ii) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action, suit or proceeding
(it being understood that this Section 10.02 shall not be deemed to alter,
amend, supplement or otherwise modify the terms of any Debt Commitment Letter
(including the expiration or termination provisions thereof)). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event of a termination of this Agreement under
circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is paid, the Company will
not be entitled to seek or obtain a decree or order of specific performance to
enforce the observance or performance of, and will not be entitled to seek or
obtain an injunction restraining the breach of, or to seek or obtain damages
or any other remedy at law or in equity relating to any breach of any covenant
or obligation of Parent or Merger Sub. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event of a termination of this Agreement under circumstances in which the
Company Termination Fee is payable, neither Parent or Merger Sub will be
entitled to seek or obtain a decree or order of specific performance to
enforce the observance or performance of, and will not be entitled to seek or
obtain an injunction restraining the breach of, or to seek or obtain damages
or any other remedy at law or in equity relating to any breach of any covenant
or obligation of the Company.

 

Section 10.03 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties of contained herein and in any certificate or
other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

Section 10.04 Amendments and Waivers.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that no amendment or waiver shall be made
subsequent to receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval which
requires further approval of the stockholders of the Company pursuant to
Section 251(d) of the DGCL without such further stockholder approval.

 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 10.05 Disclosure Letter References. The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall only
be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes
of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of
the relevant party that are contained in the

 



64  corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other representations
and warranties (or covenant, as applicable) of such party that are contained
in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties (or covenant, as applicable) would be reasonably apparent to an
individual who has read that reference and such representations
and warranties (or covenant, as applicable). The listing of any matter on a
partys Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by
such party, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material, is
required to be disclosed by such party under this Agreement or falls within
relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this
Agreement. No disclosure in a partys Disclosure Letter relating to any
possible breach or violation by such party of any Contract or Applicable Law
shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of
any matter in a partys Disclosure Letter be deemed or interpreted to expand
the scope of such partys representations, warranties and/or covenants set
forth in this Agreement.

Section 10.06 Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing (i) the past, present and future officers, directors and employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and their successors, heirs and
representatives) are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce,
Section 7.04 and (ii) from and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock and holders of Company Options shall be intended
third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, Articles 2 and 3.

(b) Except as provided in Section 10.13, this Agreement shall not be assigned
by any party by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written
consent of the other parties, _provided_ that Parent or Merger Sub may assign
any of their respective rights and obligations to any direct or indirect
Subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the Company, but no such
assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, of its
obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section
10.06(b) shall be void.

 

Section 10.07 Governing Law. Except as provided in Section 10.13, this
Agreement, and all claims or causes of action based upon, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement or the Transactions, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of
another jurisdiction.

court from any appeal thereof, in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement
of any judgment relating thereto, and each of

 



65  the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to

Section 10.09 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE

Section 10.10 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by the other parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully
executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission

terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
and each of the documents, instruments and agreements delivered in connection
with the Transactions, including each of the Exhibits and the Company
Disclosure Letter, constitute the entire agreement of the parties and
supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written 

 



66  and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.

Section 10.12 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 10.13 Acknowledgement Regarding Commitment Letters. The Company, on
behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates and stockholders,
hereby (i) acknowledges that none of the Financing Source Parties shall have
any liability under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of,
or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not
limited to, any dispute related to, or arising from, the Debt Commitment

Subsidiaries, Affiliates or stockholders, (w) submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the New York state courts or federal courts of the United
States of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan and any appellate court
from any thereof, and agrees that all claims in respect of any such
