   Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Shares exchanged

   Merger in accordance with the Election Forms and as follows:

             (a)  Elections Less Than Share Minimum.  If the number of
        BMO Shares to be issued in exchange for Stock Election Shares and
        Combination Election Shares is less than the Share Minimum (as
        defined in Section 1.4.2 hereof), then:

                  (i)  all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into
             the right to receive BMO Shares;

                  (ii) one-half (1/2) of the Combination Election Shares
             shall be converted into the right to receive BMO Shares;
             with the remainder thereof subject to adjustment as provided
             in clause (iv) below;

                  (iii)  the Exchange Agent shall select first from among
             the holders of No Election Shares, by random selection, a
             sufficient number of such holders (the "Share Designees")
             such that the number of BMO Shares to be issued in exchange
             for Company Common Shares held by such Share Designees will,
             when added to the number of BMO Shares to be issued pursuant
             to clauses (i) and (ii) hereof, equal as closely as
             practicable (but in no event be less than) the Share
             Minimum, and all shares of Company Common Shares held by
             such Share Designees shall be converted into the right to
             receive BMO Shares; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if there are not
             a sufficient number of Company Common Shares held by the
             Share Designees described in this clause (iii) such that the
             BMO Shares to be received pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) and
             this clause (iii) do not equal or exceed the Share Minimum,
             then all No Election Shares shall be converted into the
             right to receive BMO Shares;

                  (iv)  and then (if necessary), the Exchange Agent shall
             select from each of the holders of Combination Election

                                    -10-



             Shares, proportionately, a sufficient number of shares of
             the Company Common Shares held by such holders and not
             converted into the right to receive BMO Shares pursuant to
             clause (ii) above that will, when added to the number of BMO
             Shares to be issued pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
             hereof, equal as closely as practicable (but in no event be
             less than) the Share Minimum, and all such shares of Company
             Common Shares held by such holders shall be converted into
             the right to receive BMO Shares; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if
             there are not a sufficient number of Company Common Shares
             held by the holders of Combination Election Shares which
             after giving effect to clause (ii) hereof have not been
             converted into the right to receive BMO Shares such that the
             BMO Shares to be issued pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) and
             (iii) and this clause (iv) do not equal or exceed the Share
             Minimum, then all Combination Election Shares not yet
             converted into the right to receive BMO Shares shall be
             converted into the right to receive BMO Shares;

                  (v)  and then (if necessary), the Exchange Agent shall
             select from among the holders of Cash Election Shares, by
             random selection, a sufficient number of such holders (also
             "Share Designees") such that the number of BMO Shares
             received in exchange for Company Common Shares held by such
             Share Designees will, when added to the number of BMO Shares
             to be issued pursuant to clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv)
             hereof, equal as closely as practicable (but in no event be
             less than) the Share Minimum, and all shares of Company
             Common Shares held by such Share Designees shall be
             converted into the right to receive BMO Shares; and

                  (vi) the Cash Election Shares and the No Election
             Shares not held by the Share Designees shall be converted
             into the right to receive cash and the Combination Election
             Shares remaining after the conversion referred to in clauses
             (ii) and (iv) hereinabove shall be converted into the right
             to receive cash.

             (b)  Elections Equal to or Greater Than Share Minimum.  If
        the number of BMO Shares to be issued in exchange for Stock
        Election Shares and Combination Election Shares is equal to or
        greater than the Share Minimum, then all Stock Election Shares
        shall be converted into the right to receive BMO Shares, all Cash
        Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
        the right to receive cash and all Combination Election Shares
        shall be converted into the right to receive cash and BMO Shares
        in the proportion set forth in Section 1.3.2 herein.

        Section 1.4.2. For purposes of this Section 1.4, (a) the holders
   of any shares of Dissenting Company Shares shall in no event be
   classified as Share Designees, (b) the random selection process,
   referred to above, to be used by the Exchange Agent shall consist of

                                    -11-



   such procedures as shall be mutually determined by BMO, BFC and the
   Company, and (c) "Share Minimum" means that number of BMO Shares,
   priced by averaging the high and low sales price of a BMO Share on the
   day of the Effective Time as reported on the New York Stock Exchange,
   required to comprise at least fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate
   value of the merger consideration received by shareholders of the
   Company for their Company Common Shares.  For this purpose, cash and
   other property exchanged, or reasonably expected to be exchanged, for
   Company Common Shares surrendered by the dissenters, paid, or
   reasonably expected to be paid, in lieu of receipt of fractional
   shares by shareholders of the Company and otherwise paid, or
   reasonably expected to be paid, to shareholders of the Company, in
   exchange for Company Common Shares, shall be treated as merger
   consideration.

        SECTION 1.5.   ADJUSTMENTS FOR DILUTION AND OTHER MATTERS.  If
   prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall declare a share
   dividend or distribution upon or subdivide, split up, reclassify or
   combine the Company Common Shares, or declare a dividend, or make a
   distribution, on the Company Common Shares in any security convertible
   into Company Common Shares (provided that no such action may be taken
   by the Company without BMO's prior written consent as so provided in
   Section 2.18 hereof), appropriate adjustment or adjustments will be
   made to the Per Share Cash Consideration, the Per Share Stock
   Consideration and the Share Minimum.  If at the Effective Time the
   Company shall have outstanding more shares of Company Common Shares
   than are contemplated to be outstanding by the representation and
   warranty contained in Section 2.2 hereof (other than as a result of
   the Common Company Share Option Agreement), then, at BMO's election
   and notwithstanding other provisions hereof, and without limiting any
   of its other rights hereunder, the Per Share Cash Consideration and
   the Per Share Stock Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted
   downward.  If at the Effective Time the Company shall have outstanding
   more Company Common Shares than are contemplated to be outstanding by
   the representation and warranty contained in Section 2.2 hereof, then,
   at BMO's or the Company's election and notwithstanding any other
   provisions hereof, and without limiting either party's other rights
   hereunder, the Share Minimum shall be appropriately adjusted upward.

        SECTION 1.6.   CONVERSION OF DISSENTING COMPANY SHARES.  If prior
   to the Effective Time any holder of the Company Common Shares shall
   fail to perfect, or shall effectively withdraw or lose, his or her
   right to dissent and obtain payment for his or her shares of
   Dissenting Company Shares under Section 11.70 of IBCA, the Dissenting
   Company Shares of such holder shall be treated for purposes of this
   Article I like any other shares of outstanding Company Common Shares.
   If after the Effective Time any holder of Company Common Shares shall
   fail to perfect, or shall effectively withdraw or lose, his or her
   right to dissent and obtain payment for his or her Company Common
   Shares under Section 11.70 of the IBCA each Company Common Share of
   such holder shall be treated as a No Election Share and converted into
   the right to receive cash or BMO Shares pursuant to the election

                                    -12-



   procedures of this Article I and in accordance with the procedures,
   and subject to the conditions, set forth in Section 1.7 hereof.

        SECTION 1.7.   EXCHANGE PROCEDURE.

        Section 1.7.1. Upon the latest to occur of the Effective Time and
   the completion of the allocation procedure set forth in Section 1.4
   hereof, BMO shall issue and pay to the Exchange Agent the number of
   shares of BMO Shares issuable pursuant to the Merger and the amount of
   cash payable pursuant to the Merger.  The Exchange Agent shall not
   issue or pay BMO Shares or cash payable with respect to the Company
   Common Shares to any shareholder of the Company unless and until share
   certificates and required transmittal materials pursuant to this
   Article I have been received from such shareholder in proper form by
   the Exchange Agent.  The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote
   or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to BMO Shares held by
   it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold
   all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect
   to such shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto.

        Section 1.7.2. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
   Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record
   of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
   Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Shares, a
   certificate or certificates representing the number of whole shares of
   BMO Shares, if any, and/or a check representing the amount of cash, if
   any, into which the Company Common Shares held by such holder were
   converted to pursuant to the terms of this Article I.  In addition,
   certificates surrendered for exchange by any person constituting an
   "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 144(c) under the
   Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), shall not
   be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of BMO Shares
   until BMO has received a written agreement from such person as
   provided in Section 4.12 hereof.  If any certificate for shares of BMO
   Shares, or any check representing cash and/or declared but unpaid
   dividends, is to be issued in a name other than that in which a
   certificate surrendered for exchange is issued, the certificate so
   surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form
   for transfer and the person requesting such exchange shall affix any
   requisite stock transfer tax stamps to the certificate surrendered or
   provide funds for their purchase or establish to the satisfaction of
   the Exchange Agent that such taxes are not payable.

        Section 1.7.3. All BMO Shares issued and cash paid upon the
   surrender for exchange of certificates for Company Common Shares in
   accordance with the terms of this Article I shall be deemed to have
   been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
   the Company Common Shares (including, without limitation, the Company
   Rights) theretofore represented by such certificates, subject,
   however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any
   dividends or make any other distributions, otherwise permitted under
   this Agreement, with a record date prior to the Effective Time which

                                    -13-



   may have been declared or made by the Company on such Company Common
   Shares which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.  If, after the
   Effective Time, certificates representing Company Common Shares are
   presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any
   reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
   Article I, except as otherwise provided by law.

        SECTION 1.8.   DIVIDENDS.  Subject to the effect of applicable
   laws, following surrender of any such certificate of Company Common
   Shares, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
   representing whole shares of BMO Shares issued in exchange therefor,
   without interest, (a) the amount of any cash payable with respect to a
   fractional share of BMO Shares to which such holder is entitled
   pursuant to Section 1.2.6 hereof and the amount of dividends or other
   distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
   paid with respect to such whole shares of BMO Shares and (b) at the
   appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
   distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
   surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with
   respect to such whole shares of BMO Shares.

        SECTION 1.9.   WITHHOLDING RIGHTS.  BMO or the Exchange Agent
   shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
   otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares
   of Company Common Shares such amounts as BMO or the Exchange Agent is
   required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
   payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign
   tax law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld by BMO or the
   Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
   purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
   shares of Company Common Shares in respect to which such deduction and
   withholding was made by BMO or the Exchange Agent.

        SECTION 1.10.  TAX AND ACCOUNTING CONSEQUENCE.  It is intended by
   the parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization
   within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.  The parties hereto
   adopted this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
   meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States
   Income Tax Regulations.

   which more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding stock or
   comparable equity interests having ordinary voting power for the
   election of the board of directors of such corporation or similar
   governing body in the case of a non-corporation (irrespective of

   other class or classes of such corporation or other entity shall have
   or might have voting power by reason of the happening of any
   contingency which has not occurred) is at the time directly or
   indirectly owned by the Company or by one or more of the Company
   Subsidiaries.  No entity shall be deemed a Company Subsidiary or be
   required to be disclosed under the first sentence of this

   a security interest in or upon an equity interest in such entity or if
   the equity interest in question is held by the Company or a Company
   Subsidiary as trustee, executor or in a similar representative
   capacity or as agent or nominee for a third party.  Schedule 2.3.1 of
   the Disclosure Statement also contains a description of the

   Company Subsidiary is qualified to do business in each state where the
   character and location of its properties or the nature of the business
   conducted by it requires qualification.  All necessary regulatory
   approvals for the acquisition and ownership by the Company of the
   equity or similar interests of each of the Company Subsidiaries have
   been obtained by the Company, all of which are in full force and

   Subsidiary and third parties involving commitments on the part of such
   Company Subsidiary to lend money in customary amounts in the ordinary
   course of such Company Subsidiary's business and letters of credit in
   customary amounts issued by a Company Subsidiary which is a bank to

   Disclosure Statement are in full force and effect, neither the Company
   nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is in material default under any

                                    -24-



   of such policies, and all material claims in excess of $250,000 under
   such policies arising during the twelve (12) month period prior to the
   date of this Agreement have been filed in due and timely fashion,
   except where the failure to file any such claim in a due and timely
   fashion would not have a material effect on the viability of such
   claim.

        SECTION 2.15.  REORGANIZATION.  Neither the Company nor any of
   the Company Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to take any
   action which action or failure to take action would jeopardize the

        compensation plan, share option plan, share plan, share
        appreciation rights plan, phantom share plan, unemployment

        as "fringe benefit arrangements") for any employee, officer,
        director, consultant or agent, whether pursuant to contract,
        arrangement, custom or informal understanding, which does not

   arrangements and agreements listed in the Disclosure Statement, and

        been administered in form and in operation, in all material
        respects, in compliance with, all requirements of law and
        regulation applicable thereto, and neither the Company nor any
        Company Subsidiary has received any notice questioning or
        challenging such compliance.

             (b)  All employee pension benefit plans comply in form and
        in operation with all applicable requirements of Sections 401(a)
        and 501(a) of the Code, except where such non-compliance would
        not result in material liability to such plans, the Company, the
        Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary; there have been
        no amendments to such plans which are not the subject of a
        determination letter issued with respect thereto by the Internal
        Revenue Service and which would adversely affect the tax
        qualified status of any such plan; and no event has occurred
        which will or could give rise to disqualification of any such
        plan under such Sections or to a material tax liability under
        Section 511 of the Code.

             (c)  None of the assets of any employee benefit plan are
        invested in employer securities or employer real property.

             (d)  There have been no "prohibited transactions" (as
        described in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code)
        with respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by either
        the Company or any Company Subsidiary and for which the Company,
        the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary could be
        liable and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
        engaged in any prohibited transaction with respect to any
        employee benefit plan maintained by the Company or any Company
        Subsidiary.

        any such plan.



                                    -26-



             (f)  There have been no acts or omissions by the Company or
        any Company Subsidiary which have given rise to or may give rise
        to any material fines, penalties, taxes or related charges under
        Sections 502(c), 502(i) or 4071 of ERISA or Chapter 43 of the
        Code, for which the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
        Company Subsidiary may be liable.

             (g)  None of the payments contemplated by such plans,

        excess parachute payments as defined in Section 280G of the Code.

             (h)  All group health plans of the Company and the Company
        Subsidiaries (including any plans of current and former
        affiliates of the Company or any Company Subsidiary which must be

        of ERISA) have been operated in material compliance with the
        group health plan continuation coverage requirements of
        Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA to the extent
        such requirements are applicable.

        Section 2.16.4.  No employees of the Company or any of the
   Company Subsidiaries are members of a collective bargaining unit of
   the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and there have not
   been any, and to the Company's knowledge there are no threatened or
   contemplated, attempts to organize for collective bargaining purposes
   any of the employees of the Company or any of the Company
   Subsidiaries.

   constitutes, a Takeover Proposal (as defined below) or participate in
   any discussions or negotiations, or provide third parties with any
   nonpublic information, relating to any such inquiry or proposal or
   otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement a
   Takeover Proposal (as defined below); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing
   contained in this Section 2.22 shall prohibit the Company at any time
   within forty-five (45) days of the date hereof from furnishing
   information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with any
   person or entity that makes an unsolicited Takeover Proposal that
   constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) in each case if,
   and only to the extent that (a) such actions occur at a time prior to
   approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company's shareholders,
   (b) the board of directors of the Company concludes in good faith,
   after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required to do so
   in order to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties to
   the Company's shareholders under applicable law, and (c) after
   receiving an unsolicited inquiry of proposal and prior to taking such

   that such agreements shall contain terms that are no less restrictive
   than the terms of any such agreement between BMO and the Company).

        Section 2.22.2.  As used in this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal"
   shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to
   any (w) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that

   income or the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
   taken as a whole, (x) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of
   twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of equity securities of the
   Company or of twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of equity

   constitutes twenty percent (20%) or more of the net revenues, net
   income or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
   a whole, (y) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
   result in any person beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more

   that the board of directors of the Company determines in its good
   faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisors, which
   shall be an investment banking firm of national reputation, and taking
   into account all the terms and conditions of the Takeover Proposal
   deemed relevant by such board of directors, including the
   consideration to be paid pursuant thereto, any break-up fees, expense
   reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation, and the ability
   of the party making such proposal to obtain financing therefor) are
   more favorable to the Company's shareholders than the Merger, and
   (ii) that constitutes a transaction that, in such board of directors'
   good faith judgment, after consultation with its legal advisors and
   its financial advisors, which shall be an investment banking firm of
   national reputation, is reasonably likely to be consummated on the
   terms set forth, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
   and other aspects of such proposal.  As of the date hereof, the
   Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
   activities, discussions or negotiations previously conducted with any
   parties other than BMO with respect to any of the foregoing.  The
   Company will notify BMO immediately if any inquiries or Takeover
   Proposals are received by, any information is requested from, or any
   negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued
   with, the Company.

        Section 2.22.3.  Nothing contained in this Section 2.22 shall
   prohibit the Company from at any time taking and disclosing to its
   shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2
   promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to
   the Company's shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the board
   of directors of the Company, after consultation with outside counsel,

   under applicable law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, except as expressly
   permitted by Section 2.22.4 in connection with a Superior Proposal,
   neither the Company nor its board of directors nor any committee
   thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or
   modify, its position with respect to this Agreement or the Merger or
   approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, a
   Takeover Proposal.

   Section 2.22, neither the board of directors of the Company nor any
   committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to
   withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to BMO, the approval or
   recommendation by such board of directors or such committee of this
   Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose
   publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or (iii) cause
   the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
   principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to
   any Takeover Proposal.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board of
   directors of the Company, or any committee thereof, may (subject to
   the terms of this sentence) (a) withdraw or modify, or propose
   publicly to withdraw or modify, its approval or recommendation of this
   Agreement or the Merger or (b) approve or recommend, or propose
   publicly to approve or recommend, a Superior Proposal, or
   (c) terminate this Agreement in order to enter into an agreement with
   respect to a Superior Proposal, as provided in Section 9.2.1, if the
   board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
   consultation with outside counsel, that in light of a Superior
   Proposal made within forty-five (45) days of the date hereof, it is
   necessary to do so in order to act in a manner consistent with its
   fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable law;
   PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
   pursuant to this Section 2.22.4 or Section 9.2.1(f) unless and until
   (A) five (5) days have elapsed following the delivery to BMO and BFC
   of a written notice of the determination by the board of directors of
   the Company to terminate this Agreement and enter into an agreement
   with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall set forth the
   material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and (B) by
   5:00 p.m., Chicago time, on the last day of such five (5) day period,
   BMO has not submitted an irrevocable written offer to the Company to
   modify the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby so that the
   other proposal being considered by the Company no longer constitutes a
   "Superior Proposal" and the transactions contemplated hereby may be
   effected on such modified terms, and in such event, any action taken
   by the board of directors of the Company pursuant to clause (b) of
   this Section 2.22.4 shall be withdrawn.

        SECTION 2.23.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  The Company and the

   the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries will have the
   unrestricted right and authority from and after the Effective Time, to

   trademark, service mark, trade name or any other rights of others.

        SECTION 2.24.  TAKEOVER LAWS NOT APPLICABLE.  The provisions of
   any state takeover or similar law will not apply to this Agreement,

        Section 3.4.3.  BMO has filed (a) BMO's annual reports on
   Form 4-F and quarterly financial information as filed under Form 6-K

   amendments and supplements thereto and all financial statements and
   notes contained therein (collectively, the "BMO Reports").  The BMO
   Reports, as of the respective times of filing thereof with the SEC or
   the FRB, as the case may be, complied as to form and substance with
   all material requirements of the laws, rules and regulations
   applicable thereto and did not include any untrue or misleading
   statement of or with respect to a material fact or omit to state any
   material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
   in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
   misleading.  Since December 31, 1997, BMO and each of its subsidiaries
   have filed all BMO Reports, registration statements and other
   documents required to be filed by each of them with the SEC, the FRB
   or any other regulatory authority in accordance with all material
   requirements of the laws, rules and regulations applicable thereto
   except where the failure to so file such reports and registration
   statements will not have a Material Adverse Effect.

        SECTION 3.5.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF BMO.  BMO has furnished
   the Company with copies of the audited consolidated balance sheets of
   BMO as of October 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, and the related audited
   consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and
   cash flows for each of its fiscal years ended October 31, 1998, 1999
   and 2000 together with the notes thereto, accompanied by the
   unqualified reports thereon of Price Waterhouse Coopers LLP and KPMG
   Peat Marwick LLP.  Each of the financial statements referred to in
   this Section has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
   accounting principles as applicable to them and practices consistently
   applied.  Each of the financial statements referred to in this
   Section is true, correct and complete in all material respects and
   presents fairly the financial condition and the results of operations
   of the BMO and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, as of the
   date thereof or for the periods covered thereby.

        SECTION 3.6.   DISCLOSURE.  No representation or warranty made
   herein by BMO or BFC and no written statement or certificate given or
   to be given by BMO or BFC to the Company pursuant to this Agreement or
   with respect to BMO or BFC or the transactions contemplated hereunder
   contains or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or
   omits or will omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
   statements contained herein or therein, under the circumstances under
   which they were made, not misleading.

        SECTION 3.7.   FINANCING.  BMO will have at the Effective Time
   the ability to fund its obligations hereunder.



                                    -37-



                                 ARTICLE IV

                           ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

        SECTION 4.1.   REGULATORY APPROVALS.  As promptly as practicable,
   but in no event prior to preparation and filing of the materials
   described in Section 4.3 with the SEC, BMO and BFC shall prepare and
   file, or cause to be prepared and filed, applications for approvals in
   connection with the Merger with those agencies listed in Exhibit C
   which BMO, BFC and the Company believe to be all persons from whom
   approval of the Merger is required.  The Company will, and will cause
   each Company Subsidiary to, cooperate fully in the preparation and
   submission of such applications, and without limiting the foregoing,
   the Company will promptly furnish BMO with any information relating to
   the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries which is required under
   any applicable law or regulation, or by any regulatory or governmental
   authority, for inclusion in any such application.  In the event of an
   adverse or unfavorable determination by any regulatory authority, or
   should the Merger be challenged or opposed by any administrative or
   legal proceeding, the determination of whether and to what extent to
   defend any such action, or to seek appeal or review, administrative or
   otherwise, or other appropriate remedies shall be made by BMO or BFC.

        SECTION 4.2.   COMPANY SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.  As promptly as
   practicable but in no event prior to the forty-sixth (46th) day after
   the date of this Agreement, the Company shall, at a meeting of its
   shareholders duly called by its board of directors (hereinafter
   referred to as the "Meeting"), present this Agreement for the approval
   of, and adoption by, its shareholders.  The Company will use
   commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary approval of
   this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the
   shareholders of the Company.

        SECTION 4.3.   PREPARATION OF COMPANY PROXY MATERIALS AND F-4
   REGISTRATION STATEMENT.

        Section 4.3.1.  As promptly as practicable, the Company will
   prepare and file with the SEC, and as soon as permitted under
   applicable regulations of the SEC and provided the F-4 (as such term
   is hereinafter defined) has become effective, will mail to the
   shareholders of the Company appropriate proxy materials (hereinafter
   referred to as the "Proxy Materials"), including a notice of the
   Meeting, proxy statement (hereinafter referred to as the "Proxy
   Statement") and form of proxy which comply with the Exchange Act and
   the applicable regulations of the SEC thereunder.  BMO and BFC
   respectively will furnish to the Company all information concerning
   BMO and BFC as the Company or its counsel may reasonably request and
   which is required or customary for inclusion in the Proxy Materials.
   The Company shall file the Proxy Materials in preliminary form with
   the SEC as promptly as practicable and respond as promptly as
   practicable to all comments thereon of the SEC with a view toward
   mailing definitive Proxy Materials at the earliest practicable date

                                    -38-



   (the date of such mailing herein referred to as the "Proxy Mailing
   Date").  In the Proxy Materials, the Company shall present this
   Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby for approval by the
   shareholders of the Company at the Meeting.  The Company shall include
   in the Proxy Materials a recommendation by its board of directors to
   the shareholders of the Company that this Agreement and the Merger be
   approved and adopted, subject to its rights pursuant to Section 2.22.
   Prior to submitting the Proxy Materials and any amendment, supplement
   or revision thereof to the SEC or the shareholders of the Company, and
   once a reasonably final draft of the Proxy Materials or any such
   amendment, supplement or revision has been prepared, the Company shall
   distribute such draft and successive drafts of such materials to BMO
   and its counsel at the same time as such drafts are distributed to
   persons within the Company or the Company Subsidiaries and shall
   provide BMO and its counsel with the same opportunity to review and
   comment upon such drafts as the other persons to whom the drafts are
   distributed.  Prior to responding to any comments of the SEC or any
   other regulatory or supervisory authority relating to the Proxy
   Materials, the Company shall review any proposed responses with BMO
   and BFC and its counsel.  The Company represents to BMO and BFC that
   the Proxy Materials (a) will comply in all material respects with the
   provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the
   SEC thereunder and (b) will not contain any untrue statement of a
   material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order
   to make the statements therein not false or misleading; PROVIDED,
   HOWEVER, that in no event, shall the Company be liable for any untrue
   statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact in
   the Proxy Materials made in reliance upon, and in conformity with,
   written information concerning BMO or BFC which was furnished by BMO
   or BFC to the Company.

        Section 4.3.2.  As promptly as practicable, BMO will prepare and
   file with the SEC a registration statement on Form F-4 under the
   Securities Act, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a
   prospectus, with respect to the BMO Shares to be issued in connection
   with the Merger (hereinafter referred to as the "F-4").  Each of BMO,
   BFC and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to have the F-4
   declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
   after its filing with the SEC.  BMO and BFC shall also take any action
   (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it
   is now not so qualified) reasonably required to be taken under any
   applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of
   the BMO Shares in the Merger and the Company shall furnish all
   information concerning the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the
   holders of Company Common Shares as may be reasonably requested in
   connection with any such action.  BMO represents to the Company that
   the F-4 (a) will comply in all material respects with the provisions
   of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
   thereunder and (b) will not contain any untrue statement of a material
   fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
   the statements therein not false or misleading; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
   that in no event, shall BMO or BFC be liable for any untrue statement

                                    -39-



   of a material fact or omission to state a material fact in the F-4
   made in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information
   concerning the Company which was furnished by the Company to BMO or
   BFC.

        Section 4.3.3.  BMO shall take such actions as are required to
   cause the BMO Shares to be issued in the Merger pursuant to this
   Agreement to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange,
   subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing.

        SECTION 4.4.   ACCESS AND INFORMATION.  The Company shall, and
   shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, afford to BMO and BFC, and
   their respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, counsel
   and other representatives (collectively, the "BMO Representatives")
   access, during the period from the date hereof to the Effective Time,
   to the properties, assets, books, contracts, returns, reports and
   records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and the Company
   shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, furnish to BMO and
   BFC such other information concerning the respective businesses,
   properties and personnel of the Company and each Company Subsidiary as
   BMO or BFC may reasonably request.  BMO and BFC shall keep
   confidential, and shall cause the BMO Representatives to keep
   confidential, any such information so obtained from the Company and
   the Company Subsidiaries, including lists of the Company's
   shareholders furnished to BMO or BFC in accordance with the terms of
   Section 4.5 hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the foregoing restriction
   shall not apply to any such information which is or comes into the
   public domain otherwise than as a result of a breach of the provisions
   of this Section, was in the possession of BMO, BFC or any BMO
   Representative prior to the negotiations with the Company relating to
   this Agreement or at any time comes into the possession of BMO, BFC or
   any BMO Representative from third parties who have the right to
   disclose such information otherwise than in connection with this
   Agreement.  In the event that this Agreement is terminated without the
   Merger having been consummated, BMO and BFC shall, and shall cause the
   BMO Representatives to, return promptly to the Company all such
   information, which was obtained by BMO or BFC in written form, in
   their possession.  The confidentiality provisions of any agreement
   between BMO or its affiliates and the Company shall remain in effect,
   to the extent still relevant in light of the transactions contemplated
   hereby.

        SECTION 4.5.   LISTS OF COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS.  Upon BMO's or
   BFC's request from time to time, for the purpose of giving effect to
   the Merger as provided for herein, the Company shall deliver to BMO
   and BFC such lists of the shareholders of record of the outstanding
   share of the Company as of the respective dates which BMO or BFC shall
   designate, and the accuracy of each such list shall be certified by an
   authorized officer of the Company or its transfer agent.

        SECTION 4.6.   CONTINUING EFFECT OF REPRESENTATIONS AND
   WARRANTIES.  Except as contemplated by this Agreement or the Company

                                    -40-



   Share Option Agreement, each of the parties agrees not to enter into,
   or agree to enter into, any transaction or perform, or agree to
   perform, any act which would result in any of the representations or
   warranties on the part of such party not being true and correct in all
   material respects at and as of the time immediately after the
   occurrence of any such transaction or event or immediately before the
   Effective Time or that would be likely to cause any condition set
   forth in this Agreement not to be satisfied or otherwise jeopardize
   the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

        SECTION 4.7.   CURRENT INFORMATION.  During the period from the
   date hereof to the Effective Time, the Company will cause one or more
   of its representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis with
   representatives of BMO and BFC and to report the general status of the
   ongoing operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.  The
   Company will promptly notify BMO and BFC of (a) any material change in
   the normal course of its business or the business of any of the
   Company Subsidiaries or in the operation of its properties or the
   properties of any of the Company Subsidiaries; (b) any complaints,
   investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the same
   may be contemplated) of any governmental entity; (c) the institution
   or the threat of material litigation involving the Company or any of
   the Company Subsidiaries; (d) the occurrence of a Material Adverse
   Effect relating to the Company; or (e) any event or condition that
   might reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect on the
   Company or the Surviving Corporation.  As used in the preceding
   sentence, "material litigation" shall mean any case, arbitration or
   other adversary proceeding or other matter which would have been
   required to be disclosed on the Disclosure Statement pursuant to
   Section 2.11 hereof if in existence on the date hereof or in respect
   of which the legal fees and other costs of the Company or any of the
   Company Subsidiaries might reasonably be expected to exceed $100,000
   over the entire life of such matter.  The Company shall also promptly
   notify BMO and BFC of any adverse development involving any matter
   disclosed on the Disclosure Statement in response to Section 2.11
   hereof which shall occur after the date hereof and which might
   reasonably be expected to increase the financial exposure of the
   Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries thereof in an amount
   exceeding $250,000 and in any event the Company shall regularly advise
   BMO and BFC of significant changes in the status of any such matters.

        SECTION 4.8.   TERMINATION PAYMENT.

        Section 4.8.1.  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to its
   terms, other than (a) by the parties pursuant to Section 9.2.1(a)
   hereof, (b) by BMO or BFC pursuant to clause (ii), (iv), (v) or (vii)
   of Section 9.2.1(c) hereof, (c) by the Company pursuant to
   Section 9.2.1(d) hereof or (d) by either party pursuant to
   Section 9.2.1(e) hereof, and either prior to such termination or

   below) occurs, the Company shall pay to BMO within two (2) business
   days after the occurrence of such Acquisition Event, by wire transfer

                                    -41-



   of immediately available federal funds to such account as BMO shall
   designate, an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the product of the
   number of Company Common Shares issued and outstanding as of the date
   hereof multiplied by $72.50.

        Section 4.8.2.  For purposes of this Section 4.8, the term
   "Acquisition Event" shall mean any of the following:  (a) any person
   or group of persons acting in concert or entity (other than BMO or BFC
   or a parent corporation or subsidiary thereof) shall have acquired
   pursuant to a tender offer or otherwise, beneficial ownership of
   shares of the Company Common Shares representing fifty and one-tenth
   of one percent (50.1%) or more of the outstanding shares of the
   Company Common Shares; or (b) the Company shall have entered into an
   agreement with any person or entity (other than BMO or BFC or a parent
   corporation or subsidiary thereof) to (i) effect a merger,
   consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
   the Company Subsidiaries representing twenty percent (20%) or more of
   the consolidated assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
   (ii) sell, lease or otherwise dispose of assets of the Company or any
   Company Subsidiary representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the
   consolidated assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, or
   (iii) issue, sell or otherwise dispose of (including by way of merger,
   consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities
   representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the
   Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries whose business constitutes
   twenty percent (20%) or more of the net revenues, net income or assets
   of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.  The
   term "Acquisition Event" shall not include a distribution of assets or
   stock (other than the capital stock of the Company or of First
   National Bank of Joliet) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
   shareholders of the Company; but for purposes of this Section 4.8 such
   distributed assets or stock shall thereafter be treated as though such
   assets or stock are held by, or constitute an entity which is a
   Company Subsidiary.

        SECTION 4.9.   REASONABLE EFFORTS.  Each of the parties hereto
   agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
   all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
   proper or advisable under and in compliance with applicable laws and
   regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
   contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as reasonably
   practicable.

        SECTION 4.10.  AFFILIATES.  At least twenty (20) days prior to
   the day of the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to BMO a
   letter identifying all persons who are or will be, at the time this
   Agreement is submitted for approval to the shareholders of the
   Company, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under
   the Securities Act.  The Company shall request each person named in
   the letter delivered by it to deliver to BMO prior to the Closing Date
   a written "Affiliates Agreement," in customary form, providing that
   such person shall dispose of the BMO Shares to be received by such

                                    -42-



   person in the Merger only in accordance with applicable law and that
   such person has no present plan or intention to dispose of any such
   shares of BMO Shares.

        SECTION 4.11.  COMPANY ACCRUALS AND RESERVES.  Prior to the day
   on which the Effective Time occurs, the Company shall, consistent with
   generally accepted accounting principles and the accounting rules,
   regulations and interpretations of the SEC and its staff, modify and
   change its loan, accrual and reserve policies and practices (including
   loan classifications, levels of reserves and accruals and asset
   disposition strategies to (a) reflect BMO's and BFC's plans with
   respect to the conduct of the Company's business following the Merger
   and (b) make adequate provision for the costs and expenses relating
   thereto) so as to be applied consistently on a mutually satisfactory
   basis with those of BMO and BFC; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company
   shall not be obligated to take in any respect any such action pursuant
   to this Section 4.11 unless and until BMO and BFC acknowledge that all
   conditions to its obligation to consummate the Merger have been
   satisfied.

        SECTION 4.12.  COMPANY SHARE OPTION AGREEMENT.  BMO and the
   Company agree that the Company Share Option Agreement shall be
   executed and delivered immediately following the execution and
   delivery of this Agreement.

        SECTION 4.13.  EMPLOYMENT AND CONSULTING AGREEMENTS.  The Company
   shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the employees of the Company
   and Company Subsidiaries who have been heretofore designated by BMO or
   BFC to enter into employment agreements, with non-competition
   provisions, satisfactory to BMO and BFC, simultaneous with the
   execution and delivery of this Agreement.

        SECTION 4.14.  INDEMNIFICATION.

        Section 4.14.1.  From and after the Effective Time, BMO shall, to
   the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law and, without
   limiting the foregoing, to the extent provided in the Company's
   by-laws and articles of incorporation as in effect as of the date
   hereof (true and correct copies of which have been provided to BMO),
   indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has
   been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the
   Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of the Company or any
   of the Company Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party" and
   collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against (i) all losses,
   expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), claims,
   damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next
   succeeding sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of
   actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and
   whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time)
   that are, in whole or in part, based on or arising out of the fact
   that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the
   Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or served as a fiduciary

                                    -43-



   under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning
   of Section 3(3) of ERISA) at any time maintained by or contributed to
   by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries ("Indemnified
   Liabilities"), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they
   are based on or arise out of or pertain to the transactions
   contemplated by this Agreement.  In the event of any such loss,
   expense, claim, damage or liability (whether or not arising before the
   Effective Time), (i) BMO shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
   counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be
   reasonably satisfactory to BMO, promptly after statements therefor are
   received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request
   reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred, (ii) BMO and
   the Company will cooperate in the defense of such matter and (iii) any
   determination required to be made with respect to whether an
   Indemnified Party's conduct complies with the standards set forth
   under applicable law and the certificate of incorporation or by-laws
   shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to BMO and
   the Indemnified Party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that BMO shall not be liable
   for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent
   shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  In the event that any
   Indemnified Party is required to bring any action to enforce rights or
   to collect moneys due under this Agreement and is successful in such
   action, BMO shall reimburse such Indemnified Party for all of its
   expenses in bringing and pursuing such action.  Each Indemnified Party
   shall be entitled to the advancement of expenses to the full extent
   contemplated in this Section 4.14.1 in connection with any such
   action.

        Section 4.14.2.  In the event that BMO or any of its successors
   or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and
   is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
   consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
   substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then,
   and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the
   successors and assigns of BMO assume the obligations set forth in this
   Section 4.14.

        Section 4.14.3.  For six (6) years after the Effective Time, BMO
   shall maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and
   officers' liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring
   prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are
   currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability
   insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no
   less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof;
   provided that BMO may substitute therefor policies of BMO or its
   subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage and amount no
   less favorable to such directors or officers; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that
   in no event shall BMO be required to pay aggregate premiums for
   insurance under this Section 4.14.3 in excess of two hundred percent
   (200%) of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company in 2000 for such
   purpose; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the annual premiums of such
   insurance coverage exceed such amount, BMO shall be obligated to

                                    -44-



   obtain a policy with the best coverage available, in the reasonable
   judgment of BMO, for a cost up to but not exceeding such amount.

        Section 4.14.4.  The provisions of this Section 4.14 (i) are
   intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
   Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and
   (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
   to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by
   contract or otherwise.

        SECTION 4.15.  TAX TREATMENT AND TAX CERTIFICATES.

        Section 4.15.1.  Each of BMO and the Company shall use reasonable
   best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under
   the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the
   opinions of counsel referred to in Section 5.6, including, without
   limitation, forbearing from taking any action that would cause the
   Merger not to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of
   Section 368(a) of the Code.

        Section 4.15.2.  Each of BMO and the Company shall cooperate with
   each other in obtaining opinions of Chapman and Cutler, counsel to
   BMO, and Schiff Hardin & Waite, counsel to the Company, dated as of
   the Closing, to the effect that the Merger will constitute a
   reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.  In
   connection therewith, each of BMO and the Company shall deliver to
   Chapman and Cutler and Schiff Hardin & Waite customary representation
   letters in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel
   and the Company shall obtain any representation letters from
   appropriate shareholders and shall deliver any such letters obtained
   to Chapman and Cutler and Schiff Hardin & Waite.

        Section 4.16.  FIRPTA.  At or prior to the Closing, the Company,
   if requested by BMO, shall deliver to the IRS a notice that the
   Company Shares are not a "U.S. Real Property Interest" as defined in
   accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-
   2(h)(2).

        SECTION 4.17.  CONVERSION TO CASH MERGER CONSIDERATION.  At any
   time within thirty (30) days from the date of this Agreement, the
   Company may elect to have this Agreement amended to provide (a) that
   for federal income tax purposes the Merger shall no longer qualify as
   a reorganization under the provision of Section 368 of the Code and
   (b) that all Company Common Shares shall be converted into the right
   to receive Per Share Cash Consideration (the "Conversion to Cash

        SECTION 4.18.  COMPANY EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

        Section 4.18.1.  At the Effective Time, BMO shall, or shall cause
   the Surviving Corporation to, provide employees of the Company
   Subsidiary with compensation and benefits (including all compensation,
   bonuses, fringe benefits, welfare benefits, medical, dental and other
   health plans, disability pay, vacation pay, severance or termination
   pay, retirement and pension benefits) that are substantially similar
   to those provided to similarly situated employees of subsidiaries of
   BFC.

        Section 4.18.2.  At the Effective Time, BMO shall, or shall cause
   the Surviving Corporation to, provide to employees of the Company
   Subsidiary credit for purposes of eligibility to participate or vest
   in any benefit plan (including vacation) based on length of service
   (but not for determining accruals under a defined benefit pension plan
   as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA or any retiree medical plan or
   program) under the BMO/Harris U.S. Employee Benefit Plans for service
   with the Company Subsidiary performed at any time prior to the
   Effective Time, to the extent such service was recognized for such
   purposes under plans of like kind maintained by the Company or Company
   Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time.  However, with
   respect to retiree medical, service at the Company or the Company
   Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time and service at BMO (or a
   subsidiary) after the Effective Time will be added to determine
   eligibility under the existing eligibility requirements for the
   retiree medical program of the Company or the Company Subsidiary and
   individuals meeting such eligibility requirements will be able to
   obtain retiree medical coverage on a 100% employee-paid basis, without
   limiting their ability to become eligible for BMO retiree medical
   benefits.

        Section 4.18.3.  BMO shall waive all limitations as to
   preexisting condition exclusions, waiting periods, actively at-work
   requirements and physical examination requirements with respect to
   participation and coverage requirements applicable to the employees
   (and spouses and dependents) of the Company Subsidiary under any of
   BMO's or BFC's employee benefits plans that are welfare plans, funds
   or programs (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA) in which
   such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective
   Time, other than preexisting condition exclusions, requirements or
   waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such
   employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time.
   BMO or BFC shall credit each employee (or spouse or dependent) of the
   Company Subsidiary with the amount paid during the plan year or
   calendar year, as applicable, in which the Effective Time occurs by
   such employee (or spouse or dependent) toward applicable deductible,
   co-payment, out-of-pocket maximum or similar provision of BMO's or
   BFC's employee benefit plans.

        SECTION 4.19.  CANADIAN TAX RULING.  As promptly as practicable,
   BMO shall apply to the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency for an

                                    -46-



   advance income tax ruling regarding certain Canadian income tax
   matters (the "Canadian Tax Ruling") including, for greater certainty,
   rulings that:

             (a)  the proposed forward merger of the Company with and
        into BFC will not result in a disposition for Canadian tax
        purposes of the shares of BFC held by BMO immediately before the
        Effective Time; and

             (b)  the adjusted cost base for Canadian tax purposes of the
        Surviving Corporation's shares received by BMO in consideration
        for BMO's issuing BMO Shares and paying cash to the Company
        shareholders will include an amount equal to the aggregate of the
        fair market value, at the Effective Time, of the BMO shares
        issued and the amount of cash paid to the shareholders of the
        Company as a result of the Merger.

        SECTION 4.20.  FORMATION OF NEWCO.  In the event that the Merger
   is in the form of the Plan B Merger, BMO, prior to the Effective Time,
   shall organize NewCo as a Delaware corporation, become and remain the
   sole stockholder of NewCo, cause NewCo to become a party to this
   Agreement or execute a related merger agreement providing for the
   Plan B Merger, execute a written consent as the sole stockholder of
   NewCo adopting and approving this Agreement and the Plan B Merger and
   obtain all regulatory and other approvals required in connection with
   enactment of the provisions of this Section 4.20.  Furthermore, BMO
   will not transfer or cause to be transferred any stock of NewCo or
   assets of the Company to a person unless in each instance either
   (a) the transferee is a corporation and the transferor corporation
   controls the transferee corporation or (b) BMO has received an opinion
   of tax counsel to BMO or a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to
   the effect that such transfer will not preclude the Plan B Merger from
   qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code.  For
   purposes of this Section, "control" shall have the meaning set forth
   in Section 368(c) of the Code.

        adequate assurance of cure given, in either case within thirty
        (30) business days following notice of such breach from BMO or

        involving the Company or a Company Subsidiary that is a bank that

        context of all of the due diligence conducted by or on behalf of

        consummated on or before October 31, 2001; provided that if the
        Merger has not been consummated primarily due to a failure to
        satisfy a condition set forth in Section 5.2 hereof, in that
        event the forgoing date shall be extended to December 31, 2001
        unless the party requesting such consent or approval has been
        advised that the same has been or will be denied or conditioned
        in a material manner unacceptable to the party requiring such
        consent or will not be forthcoming; or

   shall have any further liability hereunder of any nature whatsoever to
   the other party hereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, notwithstanding the
   foregoing, (a) this Section 9.2.2 shall not preclude liability from
   attaching to BMO for a purported termination hereof under
   Section 9.2.1(c)(v) if such termination is determined not to have been
   permitted by the terms of such section, and (b) termination of this
   Agreement shall not terminate or affect the agreements of the parties
