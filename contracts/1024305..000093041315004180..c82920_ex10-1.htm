of _Section 4.3_ , as applicable, is a positive amount, then the amount of the

16.3.1. The indemnification undertakings on both Sellers and Buyer

six (6) years, as of the Business Closing Date, except for those (a) of a
labor nature, which shall remain valid and effective for a term of two (2)
years; (b) of a civil nature, which shall remain valid and effective for a

assessment shall have been initiated by such third party, within the terms

[initials] [initials] [initials] [initials] [initials]

   

51 
--- 

  

--- 

    

16.3.2. Furthermore:

 



  

(i) Sellers shall not be liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party in respect
of any Loss (and such Loss shall not be taken into account in
determining whether the Tipping Basket (as defined below) has been met)
unless the Losses exceed fifty thousand Reais (R$ 50,000.00) (the " _De
Minimis_ "), it being understood if such amount is exceeded in respect of a
Loss, Sellers shall pay the full amount of such Loss. For the purpose of
calculating whether the De Minimis amount is exceeded, the amounts of
individual Losses arising from substantially the same facts or circumstances
shall be aggregated; and

  



  

(ii) Sellers shall not be liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party in
respect of any Losses unless the Losses, when taken together with all
other Losses claimed, exceed two million Reais (R$ 2,000,000.00) (the "
_Tipping Basket_ "), at which time Sellers shall indemnify the Indemnified
Parties for the entirety of their aggregate Losses and not just the amount
exceeding the Tipping Basket.

  



  

16.3.2.1. The indemnification limitations provided in _Section 16.3.2_ shall
not apply to any Losses arising out of (a) _Section 16.1(iv)_ and _16.1(v)_

Representations; (c) or willful misconduct of Sellers and (d) Direct Claims.

  



  

16.4. _Taxes on Payments_. Any sum payable under this _Section 16_ shall be
paid free and clear of any Tax deduction or withholding whatsoever, except as
may be required by law. If any deduction or withholding is required by law, or
if an Indemnified Party is subject to additional taxation as a result from
such payment, the Indemnifying Party shall increase the amount of the
indemnity payment by such additional amount as it is necessary to ensure that
the net amount received and retained by the Indemnified Party (after
taking into account all deductions, tax on gross revenues, withholding,
additional taxation in respect of its receipt or entitlement to such payment)
is equal to the amount which it would have received and retained if the
payment in question has not been subject to any deductions or withholdings or
additional taxation. In the same sense, if the payment of any amounts arisen
from a Loss by the Indemnified Party results in a reduction of any taxation,
which the Indemnified Party is subject to, the Indemnifying Party shall
deduct the amount of indemnity to be paid equivalent to the benefits accrued
by the Indemnified Party regarding such payment.

  



  

16.5 _Insurance and recoveries_. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek full recovery in respect of any
Losses indemnifiable hereunder against any other potential sources of
recovery, including under all insurance policies covering any Loss against
insurers to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to
indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery
is made by any Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for which any such
Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate
amount of the recovery shall be promptly delivered to the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

16.6. _Subrogation_. The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights
of the Indemnified Party in respect of any Loss borne by the
Indemnifying Party; the

  
  

[initials] [initials] [initials] [initials] [initials]

   

52 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate in timely manner with the Indemnifying
Party in order to seek recovery from any third party for any Loss borne by
the Indemnifying Party. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Companies to, and
Sellers also shall, endeavor their best efforts to bring indemnity claims
against any third party who has an indemnification obligation to either
of them with respect to any Loss and to diligently pursue such claims until
finally adjudicated.

  



  

16.7. _Exclusive remedy_. The indemnification pursuant to this _Section 16_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties, from and after the
Trademarks Closing Date and the Business Closing Date, as the case may be, for
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking made by
the Parties in this Agreement. Any further statutory claims for Losses,
damages, rescission or seeking reduction of the Purchase Price deriving from
any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking
are expressly excluded, provided that this _Section 16.7_ shall not restrict
or limit the right of a Party to seek specific performance of any of the
obligations provided for in this Agreement or file any injunction or
preliminary remedy provided for under the applicable law.

  



  

Section 17. Management of Complaints

  



  

17.1. _Notice of Loss_. Except in the event related to a Loss resulting from
a Third Party Claim, pursuant to _Section 17.2_ below (" _Direct Claim_ "),

_Indemnified Party_ ") shall present to the other Party (" _Indemnifying
Party_ ") a notice of any issue which has given or shall give origin to an
indemnifiable right pursuant to this Agreement, as soon as practicable after
the date on which it becomes aware of the act or fact that gives or shall
give origin to the indemnity right herein foreseen, mentioning the Loss
amount, its respective calculation method and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement with respect to which this indemnifiable right
is demanded or demandable.

  



  

17.1.1. _Indemnity Payment_. The payment or reimbursement of any indemnity
pursuant to _Section 17.1_ above shall be made within fifteen (15) days as
of the receipt by the Indemnifying Party of the notice sent by the Indemnified
Party, requesting the Loss payment or reimbursement, in the event that the
Loss has been incurred. If the Indemnifying Party does not agree with the
request made by the Indemnified Party, the issue shall be subject to
arbitration pursuant to _Section 29_ and if the request is confirmed by such
decision, then the Indemnifying Party shall effect the payment or
reimbursement within fifteen (15) days after being notified of such decision.

  



  

17.2. _Losses Related to Third Parties Claims_. The Indemnified Party shall
notify the Indemnifying Party about any third party claim or demand,
judicial or not (" _Third Party Claim_ ") that the Indemnified Party has
verified that gave or shall give origin to any indemnity obligation pursuant
to this Agreement as soon as practicable (except that, in the event that such
Third Party Claim is object of an administrative proceeding or lawsuit, such
notice shall be delivered until the date equivalent to a third of the legal
deadline for answer), including the estimated amount of such claim or demand

Party shall have the right to assume the defense, at its own expenses, of any
such Third Party Claim, to be handled by a lawyer chosen by the Indemnifying
Party, who shall be acceptable to the Indemnified Party, which acceptance
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

17.2.1. _Indemnifying Party Defense_. If the Indemnifying Party elects to
conduct the defense of any Third Party Claim, it shall handle such
defense with diligence and care, and with the objective of no further losses
being incurred. In this case, the Indemnified Party shall collaborate, in the
manner which is reasonably required, in this defense or suit.

  



  

17.2.2. _Settlement_. The Indemnified Party shall not enter into any
settlement, commitment or termination of the Third Party Claim, without the
previous written approval of the Indemnifying Party. However, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the obligation to agree with any
settlement, commitment or termination of such Third Party Claim which the
Indemnified Party shall recommend and which, according to its terms, exempts
the Indemnifying Party from the payment of the total amount of any Loss
related to such Third Party Claim; provided, however that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be obliged to agree with the pronouncing of any decision or
