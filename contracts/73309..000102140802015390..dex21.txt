2.05     Purchase Price

          (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, in reliance upon the
     representations and warranties of Sellers and the covenants of Sellers
     herein set forth and as consideration for the sale and purchase of the
     Assets, at Closing, Buyer shall purchase the Assets, shall assume the
     Assumed Liabilities and shall tender to Sellers as the purchase price, plus
     or minus any adjustment in accordance with Section 2.06, the sum of Six
     Hundred Fifteen Million Dollars (US $615,000,000) (the "Purchase Price").
     The Parties acknowledge and agree that US $75,000,000 of the Purchase Price
     is for the purchase of the Steel Mill Facility in Jackson, Mississippi, and
     the Net Inventory and Receivables associated thereto, and that the balance
     of the Purchase Price is for the remaining Assets.

          (b)  At Closing, the Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to Section
     2.06, shall be paid by Buyer to Sellers in immediately available funds by
     wire transfer to an account specified by Sellers. Any adjustment to the
     Purchase Price shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.06.

2.06     Purchase Price Adjustment

          (a)  Adjustment Based on Net Inventory and Receivables. Subject to the
     limitations stated herein, the Purchase Price shall be increased or
     decreased on a dollar per dollar basis to the extent that the Net Inventory
     and Receivables is greater than or less than US $122.5 million at Closing
     as determined in accordance with this Section 2.06. In the case of an
     upward adjustment, the maximum permitted adjustment will be $5 million. In
     the event of a downward adjustment, only that amount in excess of $5
     million shall be deducted from the Purchase Price.

          (b)  Determination of Net Inventory and Receivables. Prior to the
     Closing Date at such time as the Auditors (hereinafter defined) shall
     mutually determine, Ernst & Young, LLP ("Sellers' Auditor") shall conduct
     audit procedures of the Accounts Receivable and Inventory in accordance
     with auditing procedures generally accepted in the United States and bring
     such audit forward to the day prior to the Closing Date in order to prepare
     the Net Inventory and Receivables Statement. In preparing the Net Inventory
     and Receivables Statement, Seller's Auditor shall value the Inventory and
     Accounts Receivable in accordance with GAAP consistently applied in
     accordance with Sellers' past practices. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP
     ("Buyers Auditor") shall be allowed to observe the auditing procedures and
     to review Seller's accounting records, and Seller's Auditor shall provide
     Buyer's Auditor with copies of its working papers as they are being
     prepared during the audit. (Seller's Auditor and Buyer's Auditor are
     sometimes hereinafter collectively called the "Auditors" and each, an
     "Auditor"). Representatives of both Buyer and Sellers may be present at the
     physical audits of Inventory conducted by Seller's Auditor. The Net
     Inventory and Receivables Statement shall be completed and delivered by
     Seller's Auditor to Buyer, BSC, Buyer's Auditors and the Secured Party
     Representative one day prior to the Closing Date.

          (c)  Disagreement with respect to Net Inventory and Receivables. If
     the Buyer's Auditor does not agree with the Net Inventory and Receivables
     Statement prepared by Seller's Auditor, Buyer's Auditor, utilizing the same
     agreed procedures, shall prepare a separate Net Inventory and Receivables

<PAGE>

     Statement and shall provide the same, together with its working papers
     and/or rebuttal documents, to Buyer, Sellers and the Secured Party
     Representative on the Closing Date. If the Secured Party Representative
     disagrees with the Net Inventory and Receivables Statement prepared by
     Buyer's Auditor, the Closing shall nevertheless proceed; provided, however,
     that the Purchase Price paid at Closing shall be adjusted as provided in
     Section 2.06(a) utilizing the value of the Net Inventory and Receivables
     determined by Buyer's Auditor. Buyer and Secured Party Representative shall
     use good faith efforts to resolve the disagreement between the Seller's
     Auditor and Buyer's Auditor as to the Net Inventory and Receivables within
     five (5) business days after Closing.

          If on the fifth business day after Closing, Buyer and Secured Party
     Representative have not agreed on the Net Inventory and Receivables, then
     the issues in dispute shall be submitted to Deloitte & Touche LLP (the
     "Arbiter") to be finally settled. The Arbiter shall be engaged on behalf of
     Sellers by the firm of Bradley, Arant, Rose & White, LLP, Sellers'
     bankruptcy attorneys. Upon such submittal to the Arbiter, each Auditor
     shall immediately provide its Net Inventory and Receivables Statement and
     all of its working papers and/or rebuttal documents regarding its Net
     Inventory and Receivables Statement to the Arbiter and shall cooperate with
     the Arbiter as reasonably necessary so that the Arbiter may render an
     informed decision. The Arbiter shall determine the Net Inventory and
     Receivables within fifteen (15) days of submittal to it of the issues in
     dispute, based only upon the papers received from the Auditors and the Net
     Inventory and Receivables Statements provided to it by each Auditor, and
     its interviews, if any, with the Auditors; provided, however, that the
     determination of the Net Inventory and Receivables by the Arbiter may not
     be more than the largest value, or lower than the lowest value, of the Net
     Inventory and Receivables determined by the Auditors. The Arbiter shall not
     discuss the matters in dispute with the Parties or the Secured Party
     Representative. The decision of the Arbiter shall be binding and conclusive
     on Buyer, Sellers and Secured Party Representative.

          (d)  Payment. Within two business days of: (i) the agreement on the
     Net Inventory and Receivables after the Closing as set forth in Section
     2.06(c) or (ii) the determination of the Net Inventory and Receivables by
     the Arbiter under Section 2.06(c), as the case may be, Buyer shall pay to
     Sellers an amount which represents the difference in the Net Inventory and
     Receivables as determined by Buyers Auditor and the Net Inventory and
     Receivables as determined by agreement in (i) above or by the Arbiter in
     (ii) above, whichever is applicable, such amount to be paid in immediately
     available funds by wire transfer to an account specified by Sellers. Buyer
     shall pay the fees of Buyer's Auditor and Sellers shall pay the fees of
     Sellers' Auditor and the Arbiter.

          (e)  Prorations. The Purchase Price shall be subject to an adjustment
     for ad valorem Taxes. Ad valorem real and tangible personal property taxes
     with respect to the Assets for the calendar year in which the Closing
     occurs shall be prorated between Sellers and Buyer as of the Closing Date
     on the basis of no applicable discount. If the amount of such Taxes with
     respect to any of the Assets for the calendar year in which the Closing
     occurs has not been determined as of the Closing Date, then the Taxes with
     respect to such Assets for the preceding calendar year, on the basis of no
     applicable discount, shall be used to calculate such prorations, with known
     changes in valuation or millage applied. The prorated Taxes shall be an
     adjustment to the Purchase Price due from Buyer at the Closing.

          (f)  Delivery of the Richmond Interests. Notwithstanding any other
     provision of this Agreement, in the event Sellers are unable to deliver at
     the Closing good and valid title to the Richmond Interests, free and clear
     of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, and Buyer does not
     elect to take all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of BRIC

<PAGE>

     pursuant to Section 2.01(i), the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an
     amount equal to US $550,000, and Sellers shall be relieved of their
     obligations under Section 8.02(g).

no claims, actions, suits, litigation, arbitration, mediations, investigations
or other proceedings (including qui tam actions) pending or threatened against
Buyer that challenge, or may have the effect of preventing, delaying, making
illegal or otherwise interfering with, the Transaction.

5.       COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES

5.01     Mechanics of Transaction.

     The parties agree that the transaction will be completed under the auspices
and with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court through a sale of the Assets by

<PAGE>

Sellers pursuant to a confirmed plan(s) of reorganization under the Bankruptcy
Code, which plan (the "Plan") shall be proposed by Sellers and shall be in
compliance with the terms of the plan support agreement (the "Plan Support
Agreement") to be entered into by Sellers and the Secured Parties simultaneously
with this Agreement, to which Buyer and Guarantor will also be parties.

     Each Seller, with the support of Buyer and Guarantor, shall use its best
efforts to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of the Plan and entry of an order
which, among other things, will contain findings of fact and conclusions of law
(i) finding that this Agreement was proposed by the parties in good faith and
represents the highest and best offer and should be approved; (ii) finding that
Buyer is a good faith purchaser under ss. 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code and that
the provisions of ss. 363(n) of the Bankruptcy Code have not been violated;
(iii) finding that there is a sound business purpose for the sale; (iv)
authorizing and directing Sellers to assume this Agreement and sell the Assets
to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and ss.ss. 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code, free and clear of all liens, claims, interests, liabilities and
encumbrances (including any and all "interests" in the Assets within the meaning
of ss. 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code), other than Assumed Liabilities and
Permitted Encumbrances, such that Buyer shall not incur any liability as a
successor to the Sellers' business; (v) authorizing and directing Sellers to
execute, deliver, perform under, consummate and implement this Agreement; (vi)
finding that Buyer is not a successor in interest to Sellers or otherwise liable
for any Excluded Liability; (vii) finding that Buyer's acquisition of the Assets
and assumption of the Assumed Liabilities does not reflect a significant
continuity of the business of Sellers and permanently enjoins each and every
holder of an Excluded Liability from commencing, continuing or otherwise
pursuing or enforcing any remedy, claim or cause of action against Buyer or
Guarantor relative to such Excluded Liability; (viii) finding that the Plan
complies with ss. 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code; and (ix) directing the Sellers,
at the direction of Buyer, to immediately consummate the sale of the Assets
without awaiting the expiration of any applicable time period for appealing the
sale order; and provided further that the Bankruptcy Court shall also enter an
appropriate order approving the assumption and assignment of the Assumed
Contracts. If the Plan is not confirmed within 120 days (or, at the option of
Buyer, such additional time not to exceed 60 days) after the petition date, or
if an order should be entered by the Bankruptcy Court refusing to confirm the
Plan, the parties will use their best efforts to promptly consummate the sale
contemplated in this Agreement pursuant to a Section 363 sale under the
Bankruptcy Code (an "Alternative Transaction") as more definitively set out in
the Plan Support Agreement which shall provide as follows:

          (a) this Agreement shall be approved and the Sellers shall be
     authorized and directed to consummate the sale to Buyer unless a "higher
     and better" offer is received;

          (b) Buyer will receive expense reimbursement of its reasonable
     professional fees incurred in connection with the negotiation, execution
     and performance of the Agreement, and a topping fee of $25,000,000 if an
     Alternative Transaction closes with a purchaser other than Buyer and its
     Affiliates;

          (c) any prospective bidder would be required to post a $27,000,000
     cash deposit which would become subject to forfeiture if the prospective
     bidder wins the auction but fails to close because of its own default,
     whereupon Buyer would then be entitled to receive such $27,000,000 deposit;

          (d) the initial overbid over the Agreement would have to be in Cash
     and equal or exceed the Purchase Price by the sum of $2,000,000, plus
     $25,000,000 topping fee, plus an additional $5,000,000, for a total bid of
     $647,000,000;

          (e) Buyer shall be credited in its subsequent bidding with

<PAGE>

     $27,000,000, representing expense reimbursement plus its topping fee; and

          (f) each bid after the initial overbid must be at least $2,000,000
     more than the prior bid.

5.02     Operations.

     From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement (including Section 5.03), and subject to
any applicable orders of the Bankruptcy Court, each Seller shall carry on its
business diligently and substantially in the same manner as it is currently
being conducted. Subject to the foregoing, unless otherwise consented to in
writing by Buyer, each Seller shall:

          (a) perform when due all Legal Requirements and obligations under
     material Assumed Contracts (except those relating to the Memphis Steel Mill
     Facility) and all other Contracts to the extent that they materially affect
     the Assets or the Business;

          (b) conduct its Business only in the Ordinary Course of Business;

          (c) maintain the Assets in the same condition as the Assets were
     maintained as of the Effective Date, subject to ordinary wear and tear;

          (d) take all actions necessary and appropriate to deliver to Buyer
     title to the Assets free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
     Permitted Encumbrances) pursuant to this Agreement and cooperate with Buyer
     to obtain appropriate releases, consents, estoppels, certificates and other
     instruments as Buyer may reasonably request;

          (e) keep in full force and effect present insurance policies or other
     comparable insurance benefiting the Assets and the conduct of the Business;

          (f) maintain and preserve its status as a corporation or limited
     liability company, as the case may be;

          (g) at the request of Buyer, permit and allow, prior to the Closing,
     reasonable access by Buyer to negotiate directly with and enter into any
     agreements for employment of key executives with respect to the operation
     of the Assets;

          (h) maintain the books, accounts and records in respect of the Assets
     in the usual, regular and ordinary manner, on a basis consistent with prior
     years, and comply in all material respects with all laws applicable to it
     and to the conduct of the Business. Notwithstanding any provision to the
     contrary contained herein, Sellers may continue to pay taxes and trade
     payables incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business reasonably consistent
     with past practices;

          (i) not grant any increase in pay to employees of any Seller nor
     increase any salary, commission, bonus or management fee to any employee
     other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, nor institute any bonus or
     pension or profit-sharing plan or program applicable to the employees of
     any Seller;

          (j) use its reasonable best efforts to preserve intact its Business,
     keep available the services of its officers and key employees, and maintain
     its relations and goodwill with suppliers, customers, employees, agents and
     others having business relationships with Sellers;

          (k) confer with and inform Guarantor of operational decisions of a
     material nature and report to Guarantor periodically concerning the status,
     operations and finances of its Business; and

<PAGE>

          (l) use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Guarantor to
     ensure an orderly transition and integration of its Business with the
     business of Guarantor; provided, however, that such cooperation shall not
     adversely impact Sellers' ability to operate independently from Buyer and
     Guarantor nor Sellers' ability to compete in markets in which it currently
     operates or intends to operate.

5.03     Certain Actions.

     From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement and as set forth on Schedule 5.03, Seller
shall not take any of the following actions without first obtaining the written
consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld):

          (a) amend or terminate any Assumed Contract; or

          (b) sell, assign, transfer, distribute or otherwise transfer or
     dispose of any material Assets other than in the Ordinary Course of
     Business.

5.04     Employee Matters.

          (a) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee
     of Sellers or Richmond Recycling any right with respect to continued
     employment by Buyer.

          (b) Sellers, Guarantor and Buyer contemplate that this Agreement will
     not interrupt operations at any facility being purchased by Buyer and that
     Buyer will continue to operate such facilities after Closing with
     substantially the same workforce each Seller employed at each facility on
     the Closing Date. From the date hereof through the Closing Date, each
     Seller will provide Buyer with the opportunity to conduct interviews and
     extend offers of employment to any of the executives and employees of such
     Seller. At least five (5) days prior to the Closing, Buyer shall provide
     BSC with a list of employees of each Seller, if any, that Buyer desires to
     employ at each facility. Effective as of the Closing, Sellers shall release
     all such employees, such that they will be available for hire by Buyer. All
     employer responsibilities arising prior to such release pursuant to the
     WARN Act (and any other applicable law, rule or regulation pertaining to
     the termination of any of its employees) shall be the responsibility of
     Sellers, and Sellers agree to discharge all such responsibilities. Sellers
     covenant to hold Buyer harmless from and against all direct and indirect
     costs, expenses and liabilities of any sort arising from or relating to any
     claims by or on behalf of present or former employees of any Seller
     employed at any such facility in respect to any and all matters arising or
     incurred prior to the release of employees contemplated hereby and in
     respect to severance pay or termination pay and similar obligations
     relating to the termination of such employees' employment with any Seller.
     Buyer covenants to hire sufficient numbers of Sellers' personnel at each
     facility such that no Seller shall be subject to the notification
     requirements of the WARN Act in connection with the Transaction.

          (c) Buyer shall not assume any liability or obligation of any Seller
     with respect to or in favor of any employees of any Seller.

5.05     Access to and Provision of Additional Information.

          (a) From the Effective Date until the Closing, upon the reasonable
     request of Buyer, Sellers shall allow Buyer to have access to the Assets,
     Contracts, rights, liabilities, obligations, books and records of each
     Seller, Richmond Recycling and the Business, and Sellers shall cooperate
     fully with Buyer and Buyer's representatives in connection with Buyer's

<PAGE>

     additional review of the Assets, Contracts, rights, liabilities,
     obligations, books and records of Sellers, Richmond Recycling and the
     Business. In addition, Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to
     cause their agents, representatives, remaining employees, officers,
     directors, vendors, suppliers, and customers to cooperate with Buyer and
     Buyer's representatives in connection with any reasonable request of Buyer
     relating to any Assumed Contracts between any such vendors, suppliers, and
     customers and Seller.

          (b) From the Effective Date until the Closing, Buyer, with Sellers'
     reasonable cooperation, shall have the right to make all reasonable
     inspections of the Real Property as it deems desirable, including customary
     environmental inspections of the Real Property (excluding soil borings).
     Buyer must obtain Sellers' consent to the nature, scope and location of any
     such inspection before doing it, and Buyer, if requested, shall provide BSC
     a copy of any results or report from such inspection; provided, however,
     that Sellers shall not unreasonably withhold their consent. Buyer agrees to
     indemnify and hold Sellers harmless from all liabilities and damages
     (including reasonable attorneys' fees) to persons or property caused by
     Buyer's inspection of the Real Property.

          (c) From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, Sellers shall use
     their reasonable best efforts to cause the officers and remaining employees
     of each Seller and Richmond Recycling to confer on a regular and frequent
     basis with one or more representatives of Buyer and to answer Buyer's
     questions regarding matters relating to the conduct of the Business and the
     status of the Transaction. Sellers shall immediately notify Buyer in
     writing of any material changes in the operations or financial condition of
     the Business and shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of such matters.

          (d) Each Party shall be responsible for its own costs and expenses
     incurred pursuant to this Section 5.05.

5.06     Post-Closing Maintenance of and Access to Information.

     The Parties acknowledge that after the Closing each Party may need access
to information or documents in the control or possession of the other Party for
the purposes of concluding the Transaction, Tax Returns or audits, the Assumed
Contracts and other Legal Requirements, and the prosecution or defense of third
Party claims. Accordingly, each Party shall keep, preserve and maintain in the
Ordinary Course of Business, and as required by Legal Requirements and relevant
insurance carriers, all books, records, documents and other information in the
possession or control of such Party and relevant to the foregoing purposes for a
period of five (5) years after the Closing; provided, however, that Sellers
shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, deliver all of such
information or documents in its possession in whatever form (e.g., written,
video, computer record) to Buyer and Buyer shall maintain such information or
documents in its possession in accordance with the foregoing provisions at the
corporate office of Seller located in Birmingham, Alabama for as long as Buyer
maintains the lease on such office and thereafter at such reasonable location
determined by Buyer, and the Sellers shall have a right of access as provided
herein to such information or documents during normal working hours upon
reasonable notice to Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party shall
destroy or otherwise dispose of any of the items referenced in this Section 5.06
unless the Party seeking to destroy or dispose of such items provides sixty (60)
days' prior written notice to the other Party of the intent to seek or destroy
such items and affords such other Party an opportunity to copy or otherwise
remove such items. The exercise by any Party of any right of access granted
herein shall not materially interfere with the business operations of the other
Party.

5.07     Governmental Authority Approvals; Consents to Assignment.

<PAGE>

          (a) From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, each Seller, Buyer
     and Guarantor shall both (i) promptly apply for, diligently pursue through

     efforts to obtain prior to Closing all consents, approvals, authorizations
     and clearances of Governmental Authorities and third parties required of it
     to consummate the Transaction (including the assignment of the Assumed
     Contracts), (ii) provide such information and communications to
     Governmental Authorities as the other Parties or such Persons may
     reasonably request, and (iii) assist and cooperate with other Parties to
     obtain all Permits and clearances of Governmental Authorities that are
     reasonably necessary, and to prepare any document or other information
     reasonably required of it by any such Persons to consummate the
     Transaction; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no
     Party shall have any obligation under such provisions (x) to pay any cash
     amounts to Governmental Authorities other than filing fees, or (y) to agree
     to divest Assets or limit the operations of its businesses except as set
     forth in this Section 5.07.

          (b) From and after the Effective Date until the Closing Date, each of
     Buyer, Guarantor and Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
     cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
     necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
     consummate and make effective the Transaction as soon as practicable,
     including (i) to file as soon as practicable after the Effective Date (the
     "Filing Date") a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the
     United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the
     United States Department of Justice (and shall file as soon as practicable
     any form or report required by any other Governmental Authority relating to
     antitrust, competition, or trade regulation matters), (ii) to promptly
     apply for, diligently pursue through to completion, and use reasonable best
     efforts to obtain prior to Closing all consents, approvals, authorizations,

     submissions and to use reasonable best efforts to have lifted any
     injunction, order or decree of a court or other Governmental Authority of
     competent jurisdiction or other legal bar to consummation of the
     Transaction or otherwise restraining or prohibiting the consummation
     thereof (and, in such case, to proceed with the consummation of the
     Transaction as expeditiously as possible), including through all possible
     appeals, unless waived by Buyer, (v) to assist and cooperate with each
     other to obtain all Permits and clearances of Governmental Authorities that
     are necessary, and to prepare any document or other information reasonably
     required of it to consummate the Transaction, and (vi) to execute and
     deliver any additional certificates, agreements, instruments, reports,
     schedules, statements, consents, documents and information necessary to

     expressly contemplated by this Agreement, they will not take any action
     that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect or
     materially delay the Closing or the ability of any of the parties to
     satisfy any of the conditions to the Closing or to consummate the
     Transaction.

          (c) In furtherance of and without limitation of the foregoing, each of
     Buyer, Guarantor and Sellers shall (i) respond as promptly as practicable
     to any inquiries or requests received from any Governmental Authority for
     additional information or documentation; (ii) promptly notify the other
     Party of any written communication to that Party or its Affiliates from any
     Governmental Authority and, subject to applicable Legal Requirements,
     permit the other Party to review in advance any proposed written
     communication to any of the foregoing (and consider in good faith the views

<PAGE>

     of the other Parties in connection therewith); and (iii) furnish the other
     Party with copies of all material correspondence, filings, and
     communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between
     them and their Affiliates and their respective representatives on the one
     hand, and any Governmental Authority of their respective staffs on the
     other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transaction.

          (d) Buyer and Guarantor are entitled to pursue and exhaust all of
     their legal alternatives with respect to the HSR Act; provided, however,
     Guarantor and Buyer will take any and all steps, including divesting and/or
     agreeing to divest Assets, to permit the consummation of the Transaction
     within 270 days of the Effective Date at its own expense, and with no
     reduction in the Purchase Price. Buyer shall pay any filing fees required
     to be paid in connection with the HSR Act.

          (e) Sellers, with Buyer's and Guarantor's cooperation, shall use their
     best efforts to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of the assumption by and
     assignment to Buyer of the Assumed Contracts, and Sellers and Buyer shall
     use their respective commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain all
     other consents and approvals required to assign the Assumed Contracts to
     Buyer.

5.08     Allocation of Purchase Price for Tax Purposes.

     Sellers and Buyer agree that, for income tax purposes, Seventy-Five Million
Dollars (US $75,000,000) of the Purchase Price shall be allocated to the fixed
assets and working capital of BSE and the remainder of the Purchase Price shall
be allocated among the other Assets as Buyer may determine, in accordance with
their fair market values consistent with ss.1060 of the Code, and such
allocation shall be binding upon the Buyer and Sellers for all applicable Tax
purposes. Sellers and Buyer covenant to report gain or loss or cost basis, as
the case may be, in a manner consistent with such allocation on all Tax Returns
filed by any of them after Closing and not to voluntarily take any inconsistent
position therewith in any administrative or judicial proceeding relating to such
returns.

5.09     Further Acts and Assurances.

     At any time and from time to time at and after the Closing, upon request of
Buyer, Sellers shall do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be done,
executed, acknowledged and delivered, such further acts, deeds, assignments,
transfers, conveyances, powers of attorney, confirmations and assurances as
Buyer may reasonably request to more effectively convey, assign and transfer to
and vest in Buyer, its successors and assigns, full legal right, title and
interest in and actual possession of the Assets and to generally carry out the
purposes and intent of this Agreement. Sellers shall also furnish Buyer with
such information and documents in its possession or under its control, or that
Sellers can execute or cause to be executed, as will enable Buyer (i) to obtain
suitable title insurance policies; and (ii) to prosecute any and all petitions,
applications, claims and demands relating to or constituting a part of the
Assets and the Business.

5.10     Costs and Expenses.

     Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, all expenses of

Transaction, including legal counsel, accounting, brokerage and investment
advisor fees and disbursements, shall be borne by the respective Party incurring
such expense, whether or not the Transaction is consummated. Buyer shall pay the

     From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, Sellers shall take all
actions reasonably requested by Buyer to enable Buyer to succeed to the Workers'
Compensation and Unemployment Insurance ratings, insurance policies and other

shall not be obligated to succeed to any such rating, insurance policy, deposit
or other interest, except as it may elect to do so.

5.12     Fulfillment of Conditions.

     Each Party will execute and deliver at the Closing each agreement,
instrument or other document that such Party is required by this Agreement to
execute and deliver as a condition to Closing, and will take all commercially
reasonable steps necessary or desirable and proceed diligently and in good faith
to satisfy each other condition to the obligations of the Guarantor, Buyer and
each Seller contained in this Agreement, to the extent that satisfaction of such
condition is within the control of such Party.

5.13     Release of Encumbrances.

     The obligation of Sellers to deliver the Assets free and clear of any
Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances) shall be limited to obtaining a
bankruptcy sale order that provides for the delivery of the Assets free and
clear of any Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. In the event Buyer
desires to have any Encumbrances released and discharged other than by means of
the bankruptcy sale order, Buyer, at its sole cost, shall obtain such releases
or discharges, provided that such release shall not delay or prevent the
consummation of the Transaction.

5.14     Dismissal of  Litigation

     Within three (3) Business Days of the Effective Date, BSC shall cause the
lawsuit brought by BSC against the Guarantor in the Circuit Court of Jefferson

to Guarantor a complete release and covenant not to sue on the basis of any and
all claims comprising, related to, or connected with such lawsuit.

5.15     Guaranty of Buyer's Obligations.

     Under a separate instrument, Guarantor will irrevocably and unconditionally

     In accordance with ss.1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, the making or
delivery of any instrument of transfer, including the filing of any deed or
other document of transfer to evidence, effectuate or perfect the rights,
transfers and interest contemplated by this Agreement, shall be in contemplation
of a plan or plans of reorganization to be confirmed in the bankruptcy case, and
as such shall be free and clear of any and all stamp tax or similar taxes.
Sellers shall use their best efforts to make certain that the sale order so
provides, and shall use their best efforts to ensure that the instruments
transferring the Assets to Buyer shall contain the following endorsement:

         "Because this (instrument) has been authorized pursuant to Order of the
         United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, in
         contemplation of a plan of reorganization of the Grantor, it is exempt
         from any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax pursuant to 11 U.S.C.
         ss.1146(c)."

<PAGE>

     In the event real estate transfer Taxes are nonetheless required to be paid
in order to record the deeds to be delivered to Buyer in accordance herewith, or
in the event any such Taxes are assessed at any time thereafter, such real
estate transfer Taxes incurred as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by Buyer.

5.17     Use of Name.

     For the 180 days from and after the Closing Date, Sellers may use any of
the names acquired by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or any variations of the
foregoing in the conduct of their business only as is required in or in
connection with the Sellers' bankruptcy case or the winding up of their
operations and except and solely to the extent as is required to perform any
Contract which is not an Assumed Contract; provided, however, that such use
shall not materially conflict with the business of Buyer.

     subsections (c), (e) or (f)), of this Agreement shall be true, complete and
     correct on and as of the Closing Date, except where such failure would not
     individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the
     Buyer or on the ownership or use of the Assets.

          (b) Each and all of the terms, covenants and agreements to be complied
     with or performed by Sellers on or before the Closing Date shall have been
     complied with or performed, including the obligations of Sellers in Section

     ownership or use of the Assets.

7.02     Pre-Closing Confirmations and Contractual Consents.

     Buyer shall have obtained or received from Sellers documentation or other
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that:

          (b) the Bankruptcy Court has issued a final order as described in

     by the Buyer;

          (c) Buyer has obtained such other consents and approvals (other than
     such consents or approvals where the failure to obtain such approval would
     not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the
     Buyer or on the ownership or use of the Assets) as may be legally or
     contractually required for Buyer's consummation of the Transaction unless
     waived by the Buyer;

          (d) Sellers have cured all defaults (whether monetary or non-monetary)
     under the material Assumed Contracts except for Assumed Contracts related
     to the Memphis Steel Mill Facility;

     officers, directors, employees and representatives, a complete release and
     covenant not to sue on the basis of any and all claims of any kind and
     nature, known or unknown, occurring prior to the Closing Date.

7.03     Adverse Actions or Proceedings.

     No Governmental Authority shall have taken any action or made any request
of any Seller or Buyer which could reasonably be expected to have the effect of
preventing the consummation of the Transaction, and there shall not be in effect
any order restraining, enjoining or otherwise preventing consummation of the
Transaction; provided that the Guarantor and Buyer shall have used their
reasonable best efforts to cause any such order to be vacated or lifted and
shall have performed their obligations under Section 5.07.

7.04     Deliveries at Closing.

     Sellers shall have delivered to Buyer, in form reasonably acceptable to
Buyer and approved by Buyer's counsel, the documents referred to in Section
8.02, except where failure to do so would not individually or in the aggregate
have a material adverse effect on the Buyer or the ownership or use of the
Assets.

7.05     Material Adverse Effect.

     No event or condition shall have occurred and no circumstance exists that
has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on
the condition or the operation of the Assets; provided, however, that an event

be considered to have a material adverse effect.

     terms, covenant and agreements set forth in Section 5.02 to be complied
     with or performed by Sellers (or their Affiliates) on or before the Closing

     the Assets;

          (f) a certificate of good standing from the jurisdiction in which each
     of BSC, BSE, and PESCO is organized, dated within thirty (30) days prior to

8.04     Termination Prior to Closing

     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement may be
terminated, and the Transaction abandoned, upon notice by the terminating Party
to the other Party:

               (i) at any time before the Closing, by mutual written consent of
          Buyer and Sellers without penalty or payment; or

               (ii) at any time before the Closing, by Buyer on the one hand, or
          Sellers on the other hand, in the event of a breach of this Agreement
          by the non-terminating Party which would create a failure of a
          condition to the non-terminating Party's obligation to close the
          Transaction under Sections 6 or 7, as the case may be, and which is
          impossible or impracticable, with the use of commercially reasonable
          efforts, to cure prior to the Closing; or

               (iii) at the option of any Party, if the Closing has not occurred
          within 285 days from the Effective Date; provided, however, that no
          Party may terminate under this Section if such Party's breach of this
          Agreement caused the failure of a condition under Sections 6 or 7 not
          to be satisfied.

9.       GENERAL

9.01     Schedules.

     The Schedules and all Exhibits and documents referred to in or attached to
this Agreement are integral parts of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein
and all statements appearing therein shall be deemed to be representations.
Nothing in the Schedules shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty made herein unless the Schedule identifies the
exception with reasonable particularity. Any statement, notation or other
disclosure in any Schedule relates only to the particular section or subsection
of the Agreement under which such statement, notation or disclosure is listed
and does not apply to any other section or subsection of this Agreement.

9.02     Tax Effect.

     Neither Buyer nor Sellers (nor their counsel or accountants) have made or
are making in this Agreement any representation to any other Party (or such
Party's counsel or accountants) concerning any of the Tax effects or
consequences on the other Party of the Transaction. Each Party represents that
it has obtained, or may obtain, independent Tax advice with respect thereto and
upon which it, if so obtained, has solely relied.

9.03     Reproduction of Documents.

     This Agreement and all documents relating hereto, including consents,

<PAGE>

waivers and modifications that may hereafter be executed, the documents
delivered at the Closing, and financial statements, certificates and other
information previously or hereafter furnished to any Party may be reproduced by
any Party by any photographic, photostatic, microfilm, micro-card, miniature
photographic or other similar process and the Buyer and Sellers may destroy any
original documents so reproduced. The Parties stipulate that any such
reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any
judicial, arbitral or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is
in existence and whether or not such reproduction was made in the Ordinary
Course of Business) and that any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction
of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence.

9.04     Consents, Approvals and Discretion.

     Except as herein expressly provided to the contrary, whenever this
Agreement requires any consent or approval to be given by either Party that is
not in such Party's sole discretion or either Party must or may exercise
discretion (other than its sole discretion), such consent or approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed and such discretion shall be reasonably
exercised.

9.05     Choice of Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.

     This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware without regard to such state's conflicts of laws
rules. Each of the Buyer, Guarantor and Sellers hereby submits to the exclusive
jurisdictions of the State and Federal Courts located in Delaware, including the
Bankruptcy Court, and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any objection to such action based on venue or forum non conveniens.

9.06     Benefit; Assignment.

     This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon Guarantor,
Buyer and Sellers and their respective legal representatives, successors and
assigns. No Party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of
the other Parties; provided, however, that Buyer may assign this Agreement,
without the consent of Sellers, in whole or in part, to any Affiliate or
Affiliates of Buyer; and further provided, Sellers may assign this Agreement to
the collateral agent as collateral for the benefit of the Secured Parties and/or
in connection with the exercise of such collateral agent of rights and remedies
in connection with such security. In the event Buyer elects to assign this
Agreement in whole or in part to any Affiliates of Buyer, Guarantor shall
guaranty the performance of any and all obligations of such Affiliates
hereunder.

9.07     No Third Party Beneficiary.

     The terms and provisions of this Agreement (including provisions regarding
employee and employee benefit matters) are intended solely for the benefit of
Guarantor, Buyer and Sellers, and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any
other Person.

9.08     Waiver of Breach, Right or Remedy.

     The waiver by any Party of any breach or violation by another Party of any
provision of this Agreement or of any right or remedy of the waiving Party in
this Agreement (a) shall not waive or be construed to waive any subsequent
breach or violation of the same provision, (b) shall not waive or be construed
to waive a breach or violation of any other provision, and (c) shall be in
writing and may not be presumed or inferred from any Party's conduct. Except as
expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, no remedy conferred by this
Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every

<PAGE>

remedy shall be in addition to every other remedy granted in this Agreement or
now or hereafter existing at law or in equity, by statute or otherwise. The
election of one or more remedies by a Party shall not constitute a waiver of the
right of such waiving Party to pursue other available remedies. In addition to
any other rights and remedies any Party may have at law or in equity for breach
of this Agreement, each Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction to enforce
the provisions of this Agreement.

9.09     Notices.

     Any notice, demand or communication required, permitted or desired to be
given hereunder shall be deemed effectively given if given in writing (a) on the

other electronic means, (c) one day after the date tendered for delivery by
nationally recognized overnight courier, or (d) three days after the date

9.10     Severability.

     If any provision of this Agreement is held or determined to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law by a court of competent
jurisdiction: (a) such provision will be fully severable; (b) this Agreement
will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable

the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom;
and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, the parties
hereto agree to negotiate in good faith a legal, valid and enforceable provision
as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may
be possible.

9.11     Entire Agreement; Counterparts; Amendment.

     This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous contracts,
agreements and understandings and constitutes the entire agreement of whatsoever
kind or nature existing between or among the parties hereto representing the
subject matter of this Agreement and no Party shall be entitled to benefits
other than those specified herein. As between or among the parties hereto, any
oral or written representation, agreement or statement not expressly
incorporated herein, whether given prior to or on the Effective Date, shall be
of no force and effect unless and until made in writing and signed by the
parties hereto on or after the Effective Date. Each representation, warranty and
covenant contained in this Agreement has independent significance, and if any
Party has breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in
any respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative level
of specificity) that such Party has not breached shall not detract from or
mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach of the first representation,
warranty or covenant. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more
counterparts, each and all of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. This Agreement may
not be amended except in a written instrument executed by the parties hereto.

9.12     Survival.

     The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and in any
Schedule or certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall not survive
consummation of the Transaction and shall expire immediately after the Closing;
provided, however, that this Section 9.12 shall not in any manner affect the
Purchase Price Adjustment set forth in Section 2.06.

9.13     Drafting.

     No provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted for or against any
Person on the basis that such Person was the draftsman of such provision, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Person by
virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

9.14     Publicity.

     No Party shall prior to the Closing, without prior consultation with the
other parties to the extent practicable under the circumstances taking into
account applicable laws and stock exchange requirements, make any public
disclosure with respect to the Transaction, any negotiations or discussions
concerning the Transaction or the existence of this Agreement.
