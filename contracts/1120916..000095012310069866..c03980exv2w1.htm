This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 27, 2010 (this "
_Agreement_ "), among Hess Corporation, a corporation organized under the
laws of the State of Delaware (" _Parent_ "), Hess Investment Corp., a
corporation organized under the laws of the State of Nevada and a direct
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and American Oil and Gas
Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Nevada (the "
_Company_ "). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are sometimes
referred to herein individually as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the "
_Parties_ ". 

  

W I T N E S S E T H: 

   

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have determined that this Agreement and the strategic business
combination contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and their respective stockholders and have
approved and adopted this Agreement and the Merger; 

  

WHEREAS, (i) the board of directors of the Company (the " _Board of Directors_
") has recommended approval of this Agreement by its stockholders, and (ii)
Parent, in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has agreed to
approve this Agreement and the Merger by unanimous written consent
immediately after execution of this Agreement in accordance with the
requirements of Nevada law as provided for herein; 

  

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of
the Code and that this Agreement constitutes a plan of reorganization; and 

  

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into
this Agreement, Patrick D. OBrien, Andrew P. Calerich, Bobby G. Solomon,
Kendell V. Tholstrom, Joseph B. Feiten, Nick DeMare, C. Scott Hobbs, Jon R.
Whitney, Wayne P. Neumiller, Michael J. Neumiller and North Finn LLC each
have entered into Voting and Lockup Agreements with Parent simultaneous
herewith (collectively, the " _Voting and Lockup Agreements_ "), which have
been approved by the Board of Directors for the purpose of Sections
78.411-78.444 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (the " _NRS_ "). 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as
follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER 

   

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the NRS, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company at the Effective Time (the " _Merger_ "). Upon the
consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
" _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 1.2 _Closing_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the closing of the Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take place as soon as possible,
but in any event no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver (subject to Applicable Law) of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions which by their nature are
intended to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver (subject to Applicable Law) of those conditions at the Closing) unless
another time or date is agreed to in writing by the Parties (the actual time
and date of the Closing being referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_ ").
The Closing shall be held at the offices of White and Case LLP, 1155 Avenue of
the Americas, New York, New York 10036, unless another place is agreed to in
writing by the Parties. 

  

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause articles of
merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") to be filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Nevada at the Closing as provided in Section 92A.200 of the
NRS. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger
are duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, or at
such subsequent time as Parent and the Company shall agree and as shall be
specified in the Articles of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes
effective being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger will have the effects set forth in the NRS. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, obligations, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub
shall be the debts, obligations, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation. 

  

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time and without any
further action on the part of the Company or Merger Sub, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read in its
entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub read immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that (a) the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be American Oil and Gas Inc. or such other name as
Parent may specify by written notice to the Company no later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing (such name, the " _New Name_ ") and (b)
the provision in the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub naming its
incorporator shall be omitted, until the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation is thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or
by Applicable Law. 

  

Section 1.6 _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time and without any further action on
the part of the Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended to read in their entirety as the bylaws of
Merger Sub read immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
the references to Merger Subs name shall be replaced by references to the
New Name, until the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation are thereafter
changed or amended or repealed as provided therein, in the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or by Applicable Law. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 1.7 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub as of the Effective Time shall serve as the directors
of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their death, resignation or
removal or otherwise ceasing to be a director or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The Persons designated
by the board of directors of Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time shall
serve as the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their
death, resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an officer or until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. 

  

Section 1.8 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ") or shares of capital stock of Merger Sub: 

  

(a) All shares of Company Common Stock that are held by the Company as
treasury stock (the " _Treasury Shares_ ") or by Parent or Merger Sub shall
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto. 

  

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Treasury Shares and (ii) shares
of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub) shall be converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive 0.1373 validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Per
Share Consideration_ ", and together with the cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to  _Section 2.4_, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Upon
such conversion at the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each share of Company Common Stock
shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration
and the right to receive any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
_Section 2.5_, in each case without interest, upon the surrender of such
share in accordance with the terms hereof. 

  

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Section 1.9 _Company Stock Options; Restricted Shares; Warrant_. 

  

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Parent shall not assume any Company Stock
Options in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Not later
than thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled or anticipated Closing Date, the
Company shall send a notice to all holders of Company Stock Options, which
notice shall notify such holders that (x) Parent and the Surviving Corporation
will not be assuming any Company Stock Options following the Effective Time
or substituting new options therefor, and (y) all unvested Company Stock
Options shall become fully exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time and contingent upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (and such Company Stock Options shall be so exercisable).
Any Company Stock Options that are In-the-Money as of the Effective Time and
that are not exercised prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed
automatically exercised by the holder thereof and the holder thereof shall
be, subject to _Section 2.11_, entitled to receive a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) 0.1373 multiplied by (ii) the
product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of the applicable Company Stock Options multiplied by (B) the
quotient obtained by dividing (1) the excess of (I) the Company Closing Price
over (II) the exercise price per share of the applicable Company Stock
Option, by (2) the Company Closing Price; _provided_ , that such shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be aggregated and any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be treated in accordance with  _Section 2.4_. Any Company
Stock Options that are not In-The-Money as of the Effective Time will be
canceled. Holders of Company Stock Options that become fully exercisable only
as of and effectively immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
permitted to exercise such fully exercisable Company Stock Options effective
as of and contingent upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. 

  

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_. As of the Effective Time, the restrictions
on each restricted share of Company Common Stock (collectively, the "
_Company Restricted Shares_ ") granted and then outstanding under the Stock
Plans shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, lapse
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each such Company Restricted
Share shall be fully vested in each holder thereof at such time, and each
such Company Restricted Share will be treated at the Effective Time the same
as, and have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions as, each
share of Company Common Stock not subject to any restrictions. 

  

(c) _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, in accordance with
its terms, cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a right to acquire
shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Converted Warrant_ "), on the
same contractual terms and conditions as were in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time under the terms of the Company Warrant or other related
agreement or award pursuant to which such Company Warrant was granted;
_provided_ , that (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
each such Converted Warrant shall be equal to the product of (A) 0.1373
multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
each such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, with any
fractional shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares, and
(ii) such Converted Warrant shall have an exercise price per share of Parent
Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of
(A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Converted Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B)
0.1373, with any fractional cents rounded up to the next higher number of
whole cents. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any actions necessary
to effect the transactions anticipated by _Section 1.9(a)_ under the Stock
Plans and any option agreement thereunder and any other plan or arrangement
of the Company (whether written or oral, formal or informal). As soon as
practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to each holder of a Company Stock Option any certifications,
notices or other communications required by the terms of such Company Stock
Option or any agreement entered into with respect thereto to be delivered to
such holder prior to the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

(e) The Company shall take all steps to ensure that, at the Effective Time,
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is or will be bound by any Company
Stock Options, other options, warrants, rights, agreements or awards which
would entitle any Person, other than Parent or its Subsidiaries, to own any
capital stock of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to receive any payment,
right or interest in respect thereof. 

  

Section 1.10 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. 

  

Section 1.11 _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding Company Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or different class by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination,
readjustment or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in
any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period,
or any similar event shall have occurred, the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock,
Company Warrants, Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; 
_provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 1.11_ shall be construed to permit
the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by this Agreement. 

  

Section 1.12 _Right to Revise Structure_. At Parents election, the Merger
may alternatively be structured (a) so that the Company is merged with and
into Merger Sub or another Subsidiary of Parent other than Merger Sub (with
such Subsidiary or Merger Sub surviving) or (b) so that another Subsidiary of
Parent other than Merger Sub is merged with and into the Company; _provided_
, that no such change shall alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger
Consideration or alter or change adversely the treatment of the holders of
Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares or Company Warrants. In the
event Parent makes such an election, the Company shall cooperate with Parent
and shall execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement to effect such
election. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE II 

   

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

   

Section 2.1 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of
exchanging for the Merger Consideration (a) certificates representing shares
of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and (b) shares of Company
Common Stock held in book-entry form (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "). 

  

Section 2.2 _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with or otherwise make available to the Exchange Agent, in trust for
the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the Merger

(other than (i) Treasury Shares and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent or Merger Sub) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. 

  

Section 2.3 _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable, but in any
event within ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (a) a letter of
transmittal which (i) shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to any Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, as
the case may be, to the Exchange Agent and (ii) shall be in customary form
and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (b)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of any Certificate or the
transfer of any Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall
be entitled to receive, upon (x) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with a duly executed and completed letter of
transmittal, or (y) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated

requested by the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares, and such surrendered Certificate or transferred Uncertificated Shares

Stock constituting Merger Consideration, at Parents option, shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is requested by
a holder of shares of Company Common Stock or is otherwise required under
Applicable Law. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the
Merger Consideration. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company (such shares, the " _Unregistered Transferred Shares_ "), the
aggregate Merger Consideration that the holder of record of such Unregistered
Transferred Shares has the right to receive with respect thereto pursuant to 
_Section 1.8_ may be issued and paid to the transferee of such Unregistered
Transferred Shares if (A) the Certificate representing such Unregistered
Transferred Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and (B) the Person
requesting such payment of Merger Consideration shall (1) pay to the Exchange
Agent any applicable stock transfer taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Unregistered
Transferred Shares or (2) establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such stock transfer taxes have been paid or are
not applicable. 

  

Section 2.4 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and no
certificates or other evidence of ownership thereof will be issued in
connection with the Merger. Instead, Parent shall pay to each holder of
Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock (after taking into account and aggregating all shares or
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled) an
amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock by the last reported sale price of Parent
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as reported in
the _Wall Street Journal_ or, if not so reported, in another source mutually
agreed by Parent and the Company, on the last full trading day prior to the

(a) Set forth in Schedule 3.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter is an
accurate and complete list of each employee benefit plan, within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _ERISA_ "), whether or
not subject to ERISA, and each stock option, restricted stock, stock-based,
incentive, bonus, profit-sharing, savings, deferred compensation, health,
medical, dental, life insurance, disability, accident, supplemental
unemployment or retirement, employment, severance or salary or benefits
continuation or fringe benefit plan, program, arrangement, agreement or
commitment maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary thereof (including, for
this purpose and for the purpose of all of the representations in this
_Section 3.18_, any predecessors to the Company or its Subsidiaries and all
employers (whether or not incorporated) that would be treated together with
the Company and/or any such Subsidiary as a single employer within the
meaning of Section 414 of the Code) or to which the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof contributes (or has any obligation to contribute), has any liability
or is a party (collectively, the " _Company Plans_ "). 

  

(b) Correct and complete copies of the following documents with respect to
each Company Plan have been delivered or made available by the Company to
Parent, to the extent applicable: (i) all Company Plan documents, together
with all amendments and attachments thereto (including, in the case of any
Company Plan not set forth in writing, a written description thereof); (ii)
all trust documents, declarations of trust and other documents establishing
other funding arrangements, and all amendments thereto and the latest
financial statements thereof; (iii) the annual report on IRS Form 5500 for
each of the past three (3) years and all schedules thereto; (iv) the most
recent IRS determination letter or opinion letter; and (v) all summary plan
descriptions and summaries of material modifications. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Each Company Plan is in compliance with ERISA, the Code, all other
Applicable Laws and its governing documents, except as would not reasonably
be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a material
liability of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Each Company Plan that
is intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code has
received a favorable determination letter or an opinion letter from the IRS
covering all Tax law changes, and the Company is not aware of any
circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in the loss of the
qualification of such Company Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. No
Company Plan is covered by Title IV of ERISA or subject to Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA. All contributions required to be made under the
terms of any Company Plan have been timely made or have been reflected in the
financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Reports
filed prior to the date hereof. There has been no amendment to, announcement
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any Company Plan which would increase the
expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred
therefor for the most recent plan year. No Company Plan provides for post-
employment or retiree health, life insurance or other welfare benefits.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
directors, officers or employees, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
other "disqualified person" or "party in interest" (as defined in
Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code and Section 3(14) of ERISA, respectively) has
engaged in any transaction, act or omission to act in connection with any
Company Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of
a material penalty or fine pursuant to Section 502 of ERISA, damages pursuant
to Section 409 of ERISA or a tax pursuant to Section 4975 of the Code. No
liability, claim, action, litigation, audit, examination, investigation or
administrative proceeding has been made, commenced or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Plan (other than routine
claims for benefits payable in the ordinary course). No disallowance of
a deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code for any amount paid or payable
by the Company or any Subsidiary thereof has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur. All Company Plans that are subject to Section 409A of the
Code are in compliance with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the
regulations thereunder. Neither the execution of this Agreement, stockholder
approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent event) will: (i) entitle any employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon
any termination of employment after the date hereof, (ii) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting, result in any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount
payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, or result in
"parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G of the Code)
under any of the Company Plans, or (iii) limit or restrict the right of the
Company to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Plans. No current or
former officer, director or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company has or will obtain a right to receive a gross-up payment from the
Company or any such Subsidiary with respect to any excise taxes that may be
imposed upon such individual pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, Section
4999 of the Code or otherwise. Except as required to maintain the tax-
qualified status of any Company Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a)
of the Code, no condition or circumstance exists that would prevent the
amendment or termination of any Company Plan. 

  

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a party to or
subject to, or is currently negotiating in connection with entering into, any
collective bargaining agreement or other labor agreement with any union or
labor organization, and there has not been any activity or proceeding of any
labor organization or employee group to organize any such employees. There
are no (i) unfair labor practice charges or complaints against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pending before the National Labor Relations Board;
(ii) labor strikes, slowdowns or stoppages actually pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and there have been no labor strikes, slowdowns or
stoppages against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the past three
(3) years; (iii) representation claims or petitions pending before the
National Labor Relations Board; and (iv) grievances or pending arbitration
proceedings against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that arose out of
or under any collective bargaining agreement. 

  

(e) Since January 1, 2009, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
effectuated or announced, or plans to effectuate or announce: (i) a "plant
closing" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment or one
or more facilities or operating units within any site of employment or
facility of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) a "mass layoff" (as
defined in the WARN Act); or (iii) such other transaction, layoff, reduction
in force or employment terminations sufficient in number to trigger
application of any similar Applicable Law.

Section 3.19 _Insurance_. The Company has provided or made available to Parent
true, correct and complete copies of its primary director and officer and
employee and officer insurance policies and will make available to Parent,
prior to the Closing Date, true and complete copies of all material policies
of insurance to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a beneficiary
or named insured. The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain insurance
coverage with reputable insurers in such amounts and covering such risks as
are in accordance with normal industry practice for companies engaged in
businesses similar to that of the Company or its Subsidiaries (taking
into account the cost and availability of such insurance). Each insurance
policy of the Company and its Subsidiaries is valid, binding and enforceable
by and against the Company or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, has not
been terminated by any party thereto and all premiums due with respect to
all such insurance policies have been paid. No notice of cancellation or
termination has been received by the Company with respect to any insurance
policy of the Company or its Subsidiaries. There is no material claim by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending under any insurance policy of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. 

  

Section 3.20 _Real Property_. Schedule 3.20 of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a true and complete list of the following (other than Oil and Gas
Interests): (i) all real property owned by the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries (" _Owned Real Property_ "); and (ii) all real property which is
leased, licensed, or otherwise occupied by the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries (" _Leased Real_   _Property_ "). The Company or one of its
Subsidiaries has indefeasible, good and marketable title to all the Owned
Real Property and has a valid leasehold interest in all the Leased Real
Property, in each case free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens.
With respect to the Leased Real Property, each lease or sublease therefor has
previously been delivered to Parent and is valid, binding and enforceable by
and against the Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable, in accordance with
its terms and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of
or default under such lease or sublease except for such breaches and defaults
as have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. 

  

Section 3.21 _Personal Property_. The Company and its Subsidiaries have good
and valid title to, or valid and enforceable right to use under existing
franchises, easements or licenses, or valid and enforceable leasehold
interests in, all of its tangible and intangible personal properties, rights
and assets necessary to carry on their businesses as now being conducted,
except for such defects that, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company, in each case free and clear of all Liens, except for
Permitted Liens. Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all items
of operating equipment owned or leased by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with a fair market value in excess of $1,000,000 as of the date
of this Agreement (i) are, in the aggregate, in a state of repair so as to be
adequate for reasonably prudent operations in the areas in which they are
operated and (ii) are adequate, together with all other properties of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, to comply in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice with the requirements of all applicable
contracts, including sales contracts. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 3.22 _Regulatory Matters_. All natural gas pipeline systems and
related facilities constituting the Companys and or any of its Subsidiaries
properties are (a) "gathering facilities" that are exempt from regulation by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the Natural Gas Act of 1938,
as amended, and (b) not subject to rate regulation or
comprehensive nondiscriminatory access regulation under the laws of any state
or other local jurisdiction. 

  

Section 3.23 _Derivatives_. Schedule 3.23 of the Company Disclosure Letter
contains an accurate and complete list of all outstanding Derivative
positions of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including Hydrocarbon and
financial Derivative positions attributable to the production and marketing
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date reflected therein,
and there have been no changes since the date thereof, except for changes in
financial Derivative positions occurring in the ordinary course of business
and in accordance with the Companys policies and practices. 

   

Section 3.24 _Oil and Gas Interests_. 

  

(a) Except (i) as, individually or in the aggregate, would not be material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) for goods and
other property sold, used or otherwise disposed of since December 31, 2009 in
the ordinary course of business, the Company and its Subsidiaries are the
sole and legal beneficial owners with good and defensible title to all of
the Oil and Gas Interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries free and clear
of all Liens except (A) Permitted Liens and (B) Production Burdens set forth
on Schedule 3.17(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Letter. For purposes of
this _Section 3.24_, "good and defensible title" means title that is free
from reasonable doubt to the end that a prudent person engaged in the
business of purchasing and owning, developing, and operating producing oil
and gas properties in the geographical areas in which they are located, with
knowledge of all of the facts and their legal bearing, would be willing to
accept the same acting reasonably. 

  

(b) All of the Wells have been drilled, completed and operated within the
limits permitted by the applicable pooling or unit agreements or other
applicable Contracts and Applicable Law, and all drilling and completion of
the Wells and all related development, production and other operations have
been conducted in material compliance with all Applicable Laws. Schedule
3.24(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date hereof,
the Companys and its Subsidiaries average net revenue interests (working
interest less Production Burdens) for all Wells. Exhibit B of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth the Companys and its Subsidiaries net
revenue interests with respect to all OandG Leases. 

  

(c) (i) Each OandG Lease is valid, binding and enforceable by and against the
Company or its Subsidiary (subject to lease expirations in the ordinary
course of business), has been validly recorded or registered with all
relevant Governmental Entities so as to provide actual or constructive notice
to and be enforceable against all Third Parties, and has not been
terminated; (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the
Knowledge of the Company, any other party to an OandG Lease, has violated any
provision of, or taken or failed to take any act which, with or without
notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under
the provisions of such OandG Lease; (iii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has breached, violated or defaulted under any OandG Lease or
received notice from any other party to an OandG Lease alleging such a breach,
violation or default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv)
all payments (including all delay rentals, royalties, shut-in royalties and
valid calls for payment or prepayment under operating agreements) owing by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any OandG Lease to which it is a
party have been and are being made (timely, and before the same
became delinquent) by the Company or such Subsidiary; (v) to the Knowledge of
the Company, there are no pending claims or demands for nonpayment,
underpayment or mispayment of bonus payments, rentals, royalties, overriding
royalties, compensatory royalties and other payments due from or in
respect of production with respect to the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries interests in any OandG Lease; and (vi) neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party
to an OandG Lease, has failed, partially failed, or omitted to record or
register any OandG Lease or any assignments of record title or operating rights
in the real property or other country records related to the Oil and Gas
Interests purported to be owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries with any
Governmental Entity. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) (i) Company or its Subsidiaries has obtained all permits, licenses,
consents, certificates, easements, authorizations, certificates of
convenience and necessity, and other similar rights that are granted by
Governmental Entities and that relate to the Oil and Gas Interests (" _O andG
Permits_") necessary to own and operate the Oil and Gas Interests
in compliance with all Applicable Laws and with the provisions of all
applicable OandG Leases and Contracts to which Company or its Subsidiaries are
a party; (ii) all of the OandG Permits are in full force and effect; (iii) all
fees and charges relating to the OandG Permits have been paid; (iv)
all applications for renewal of the OandG Permits have been timely filed; and
(v) all government filings and notices required to be made with respect to
the Oil and Gas Interests have been made or given and are current, in full
force and effect, and not in default. 

  

(e) There are no change of control or preferential rights to purchase
provisions applicable to the Oil and Gas Interests owned by the Company or
its Subsidiaries that are triggered by the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Merger. 

  

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is obligated, by virtue of
a prepayment arrangement, a "take or pay" arrangement, production payment or
any other arrangement, to deliver oil, gas or other Hydrocarbons produced
from its Oil and Gas Interests at some future time without then receiving
full payment therefor. No OandG Lease contains a representation or warranty from
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the amount of oil,
gas, or other liquid Hydrocarbons to be delivered from the Oil and Gas
Interests. All payments for any Hydrocarbons sold from the Oil and Gas
Interests pursuant to the OandG Leases are being made to the Company and its
Subsidiaries within the time periods and in accordance with the prices set
forth in such OandG Leases, subject to later adjustments in the normal course
of business required by allocations between producers or by other
circumstances routinely requiring retroactive payment adjustments
by purchasers in the ordinary course of the Companys business consistent
with past practice.

in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or
leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary, other than in
such jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify or to be in good standing

Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate or (2) any condition set forth in
_Article VII_ not to be satisfied and (y) any failure of a Party to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by such Party hereunder; _provided_ , that the delivery of any

(b) Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification under _Section

or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and neither Parent nor the

be used, (ii) such Indemnified Person will cooperate with Parent and the
Surviving Cooperation in the defense of any such Action and (iii) neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement
effected without Parents prior written consent; and  _provided_ , _further_
, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Person if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Person in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by Applicable Law. 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any
Indemnified Persons on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 6.6_ shall continue
in effect until the final disposition of such Action.
