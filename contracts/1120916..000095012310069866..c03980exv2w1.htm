determination letter or an opinion letter from the IRS covering all Tax law changes, and the

act or omission to act in connection with any Company Plan that would reasonably be expected to
result in the imposition of a material penalty or fine pursuant to Section&nbsp;502 of ERISA, damages

claim, action, litigation, audit, examination, investigation or administrative proceeding has been

(other than routine claims for benefits payable in the ordinary course). No disallowance of a
deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code for any amount paid or payable by the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur. All Company Plans that are

termination of employment after the date hereof, (ii)&nbsp;accelerate the time of payment or vesting,
result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
