AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of July
20, 2007, among Teleflex Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),
AM Sub Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent (" _Sub_ "), and Arrow International, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation
(the " _Company_ ").   

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Sub has
approved this Agreement and the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the
" _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, no par
value, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), other than shares of
Company Common Stock directly owned by Parent, Sub or any Subsidiary of the
Company or held by the Company as treasury shares, will be converted into the
right to receive $45.50 in cash; and   

WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also
to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.   

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree
as follows:   

ARTICLE I    

The Merger    

Section 1.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Pennsylvania Business
Corporation Law of 1988, as amended (the " _PBCL_ "), Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective
Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease, and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ").   

Section 1.02. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the first business day after
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to
the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions) at the offices of
Dechert LLP, Cira Centre, 2929 Arch Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, unless
another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".   

Section 1.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as promptly as reasonably practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall
file with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") in such form as is required
by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the PBCL and
shall make all other filings and recordings required under the PBCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Articles of Merger
are filed with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_ ".   

Section 1.04. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Chapter 19 of the PBCL.   

Section 1.05. _Articles of Incorporation and By-laws_. (a) The Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Articles_
"), shall be amended at the Effective Time to be in the form of _Exhibit A_
and, as so amended, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.   

(b) The by-laws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.   

Section 1.06. _Directors_. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.   

Section 1.07. _Officers_. The officers of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.   

ARTICLE II    

Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the    

Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates; Adjustments;    

Company Stock Options    

Section 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub:   

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock, Parent-Owned Stock and Sub-Owned Stock_.
Each share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by Parent or Sub or
held by the Company as treasury shares immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is directly owned by any Subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding
shares to be canceled or converted in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) shall
be converted into the right to receive $45.50 in cash, without interest (the
" _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such shares
of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_
") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been authorized
by the Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.   

Section 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to
the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for
the payment of the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying
Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
as and when required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").   

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in
customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender
to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any fiduciary
or surety bonds or any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has
the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this Article
II and any dividends or other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time which may have been authorized by the Company and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II.   

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations obligation to
pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to
the Effective Time which may have been authorized by the Company and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the close of business on the day on
which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, it shall be cancelled against delivery of cash to
the holder thereof as provided in this Article II.   

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for 12 months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent, upon
demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and
Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.   

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance
with any applicable state, Federal or other abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the
date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.   

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard
and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank which are then publicly available). Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent. Nothing
contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the
Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein.   

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond or surety in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable
Merger Consideration with respect thereto.   

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person, as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving

Representations and Warranties    

Section 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as
disclosed (i) in any SEC Document filed with the SEC from and after August
31, 2005 through the date hereof (a " _Filed SEC Document_ ") (but only to
the extent (x) such disclosure does not constitute forward-looking or
cautionary disclosures set forth in a "risk factor" section or a "forward-
looking statement" under the heading " _Forward-Looking Statements_ " in any
of such Filed SEC Documents and (y) the applicability of such disclosure to a
section or subsection of these representations and warranties is reasonably
apparent) or (ii) as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the
Company to Parent on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being understood that any information set forth in
one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to
apply to each other section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent that such information is relevant to such
other section or subsection), the Company represents and warrants to Parent
and Sub as follows:   

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power
and authority to carry on its business as presently conducted, except where
the failure to have such power or authority, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and, with
respect to jurisdictions in which such concept is recognized, is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified, licensed or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement a complete and correct copy
of the Company Articles, the Restated By-laws of the Company and any
amendments thereto (the " _Company By-laws_ ") and the comparable
organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement.   

(b) _Subsidiaries_. Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists
each Subsidiary of the Company and, for each such Subsidiary, its
jurisdiction of organization. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of,
or other equity interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have been
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned, directly
or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges,
mortgages, encumbrances or security interests of any kind or nature
whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ "), other than Permitted Liens. Except
for the capital stock of, or voting securities or equity interests in,
its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any
capital stock of, or voting securities or equity interests in, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, association or other entity.   

(c) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "
and, together with the Company Common Stock, the " _Company Capital Stock_
"). At the close of business on July 2, 2007 (i) 45,276,650 shares of Company
Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii) 7,680,976 shares of Company
Common Stock were held by the Company as treasury shares, (iii) 14,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock were reserved and available for issuance
pursuant to the Companys 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the " _1999
Stock Option Plan_ "), and 500,000 shares of Company Common Stock were
reserved and available for issuance pursuant to the Companys 2006 Directors
Stock Incentive Plan (together with the 1999 Stock Option Plan, the "
_Company Stock Option Plans_ "), of which an aggregate of 2,797,092 shares of
Company Common Stock were subject to outstanding options to acquire shares of
Company Common Stock from the Company (the " _Company Stock Options_ ") and
(iv) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding or held
by the Company as treasury shares. The Company has made available to Parent a
list of each Company Stock Option issued as of July 2, 2007, the number of
shares of Company Common Stock issuable thereunder, the expiration date and
the exercise price thereof. Except as set forth above, at the close of
business on July 2,? 2007, no shares of Company Common Stock or other capital
stock or other voting securities of the Company were issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding. Since the close of business on July 2, 2007 through
the date of this Agreement, other than in connection with the issuance of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of Company Stock Options
outstanding as of July 2,? 2007 as set forth on Section 3.01(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, no shares of Company Common Stock or other capital
stock or voting securities of the Company were issued and there has been no
change in the number of outstanding Company Stock Options. All outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock are, and all such shares that may be issued
prior to the Effective Time will be when issued, duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and not subject to or issued in
violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal,
preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under any provision
of the PBCL, the Company Articles, the Company By-laws or any Contract to
which the Company is a party or otherwise bound. Except for any obligations
under any Company Stock Plan or as otherwise set forth above, as of the date
of this Agreement, there are no options, warrants, calls, rights, convertible
or exchangeable securities, stock-based performance units, or Contracts to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them is bound (i) obligating the Company or any such Subsidiary to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares
of capital stock or other equity interests in, or any security convertible or
exchangeable for any capital stock of or other equity interest in, the
Company or of any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) obligating the Company or any
such Subsidiary to issue, grant or enter into any such option, warrant, call,
right, convertible or exchangeable security, stock-based performance unit or
Contract. Except as set forth above, there are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the Company or any such
Subsidiary. As of the date of the most recent financial statements included
in the Companys SEC Documents, the only principal amount of outstanding
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries or principal amount of
outstanding Indebtedness of any other Person that is guaranteed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding any (x) intercompany amounts, (y)
undrawn letters of credit and (z) a principal amount of outstanding
Indebtedness not in excess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate) is $62.0 million
under the Companys Loan Agreement, dated as of April 12, 2001, as amended,
with First Union National Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain
lenders named therein.   

(d) _Authority; Noncontravention_. The Company has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject only to, in the case
of the Merger, the receipt of the Shareholder Approval. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action and proceedings on the part of the Company,
subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of the Shareholder Approval).
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the other
parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,

creditors rights and to general equity principles. The Company Board, at a
meeting duly called and held, duly adopted resolutions (i) approving this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) directing that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to
a vote at a meeting of the shareholders of the Company and (iii) recommending
that the shareholders of the Company adopt this Agreement, which resolutions
have not been heretofore rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way except
as permitted under Section 4.02(b). The execution and delivery by the Company
of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions
of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give
rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under, or result in
the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the Company Articles,
the Company By-laws or the comparable organizational documents of any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in
the following sentence, (A) any contract, lease, indenture, note, bond
or other agreement that is in full force and effect (a " _Contract_ ") to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
their respective properties or assets are bound or (B) assuming the consents,
approvals and authorizations referred to below are duly and timely made or
obtained, any statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation of any Governmental
Entity (" _Law_ ") or any judgment, order or decree of any Governmental
Entity (" _Judgment_ "), in each case binding on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the
case of clause (ii) above, any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights,
losses or Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any federal, state,
local or foreign government, any court, any administrative, regulatory
(including any stock exchange) or other governmental agency, commission or
authority (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ ") is required to be obtained or
made by or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
or the consummation by the Company of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (i) the filing of a
premerger notification and report form by the Company under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "),
and the filings and receipt, termination or expiration, as applicable, of
such other approvals or waiting periods as may be required under any other
applicable competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Law, (ii) the
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") of (A) a
proxy statement relating to the approval by the shareholders of the Company
of this Agreement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy

as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), as may be required in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) the
filing of the Articles of Merger with the Department of State of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and appropriate documents with the
relevant authorities of other jurisdictions in which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business, (iv) any filings required under
the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ National Market and (v) such other
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations, filings and notices the failure of which to be obtained or

Effect.   

(e) _SEC Documents_. (i) The Company has timely filed all reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other documents with the SEC required to be filed by
the Company since August 31, 2005 (the " _SEC Documents_ "). As of their
respective filing dates, the SEC Documents complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to such SEC
Documents, in each case as in effect at such time, and none of the SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The financial statements (including the notes
thereto) of the Company included in the SEC Documents when filed complied
as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in all material respects
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ")
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as permitted by Form
10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal
year-end adjustments). Except as set forth in the financial statements
(including the notes thereto) included in the Filed SEC Documents, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities that would
be required under GAAP, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company (including the notes
thereto), except liabilities and obligations that (A) were incurred since the
date of the most recent audited balance sheet included in such financial
statements in the ordinary course of business, (B) are incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (C) individually or
in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
made available to Parent true and complete copies of all material
correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, occurring since August 31, 2006 and
prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, there are no material
outstanding or unresolved comments in a comment letter received from the SEC
staff with respect to any SEC Document.   

(ii) The Company has made all certifications and statements required by
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the Companys
filings pursuant to the Exchange Act. The Company has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to
ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the individuals responsible for
the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and other
public disclosure documents.   

(f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by, or on behalf of, the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the
shareholders of the Company and at the time of the Shareholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by the
Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on information supplied by, or on behalf of, shareholders of
the Company, Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder.   

(g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. From the date of the most recent
financial statements included in the Filed SEC Documents to the date of this
Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their business
only in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, and during such
period there has not been:   

(i) any change, effect, event or occurrence or state of facts that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to
have, any Material Adverse Effect;   

(ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to any capital

(iv) (A) any granting by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any current
or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of any material increase in compensation, except for increases
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or increases
required under any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, (B) any
granting to any current or former director, officer or employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries of the right to receive any material severance or
termination pay not provided for under any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement except as required to comply with applicable Law or (C) any
entry by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries into, or any amendments of any
Company Benefit Agreements and (D) the removal or modification of any
restrictions in any Company Benefit Agreement or Company Benefit Plan or
awards made thereunder, except as required to comply with applicable Law or

Company or any of its Subsidiaries materially affecting the consolidated
assets, liabilities or results of operations of the Company, except insofar

the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, any of the executive officers or directors
of the Company in connection with his or her status as an executive officer
or director of the Company that, individually or in the aggregate, would have
a Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any unsatisfied Judgment outstanding
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the
aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect.   

(i) _Contracts_. (i) Except for this Agreement and Contracts filed as
exhibits to the Filed SEC Documents, Section 3.01(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and correct list, as of the date of
this Agreement, and the Company has made available to Parent complete and
correct copies (including by filing with the SEC), of:

(C) each loan and credit agreement, note, debenture, bond, indenture and other
similar Contract pursuant to which any Indebtedness of the Company or any of

within one year;   

(E) each Contract entered into within five years of the date of this
Agreement, to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party for the

$5,000,000 except for acquisitions and dispositions of properties and assets
in the ordinary course of business (including acquisitions and dispositions
of inventory);   

(F) each Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
constituting a joint venture, partnership, limited liability or other similar

(G) any Contract with respect to the employment of any director or executive

Each such Contract described in clauses (A) through (G) is referred to herein
as a " _Material Contract_ ".   

(ii) Each of the Material Contracts is valid and binding on the Company or the
Subsidiary of the Company party thereto and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except for such
failures to be valid and binding or to be in full force and effect that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
None of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has received written
notice of default under any Material Contract by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no default by any
other party thereto, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or
the giving of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, by
any other party thereto, in each case except as, individually or in the

(j) _Compliance with Laws; Regulations_. (i) Each of the Company and its

a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has in
effect all approvals, authorizations, certificates, franchises, licenses,
permits and consents of Governmental Entities (collectively, " _Permits_ ")
necessary for it to conduct its business as presently conducted, and all such
Permits are in full force and effect, except for such Permits the absence of
which, or the failure of which to be in full force and effect, individually
or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently excluded from participation,
or is otherwise ineligible to participate, in a "federal health care program"
as defined in 42 U.S.C. §1320a-7b(f) or since August 31, 2006 has been
convicted of a criminal offense related to health care. Since August 31,
2006, there has occurred no default under, or violation of, any Permit,
except for any such default or violation that individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
The consummation of the Merger, in and of itself, would not cause the
revocation, modification or cancellation of any such Permit that individually
or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. This Section 3.01(j)(i) does not relate to matters relating to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which are the subject of Section 3.01(e)(ii),
environmental matters, which are the subject of Section 3.01(k), employee

(ii) To the Knowledge of the Company (which, for purposes of this Section
3.01(j)(ii), shall include the actual Knowledge of the individuals listed on
Section 3.01(j)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter), neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any enforcement action by the FDA
or any other Governmental Entity which has jurisdiction over the operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries except where such action would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. All material reports, documents, claims and notices
required to be filed, maintained, or furnished to the FDA or any Governmental
Entity by the Company and its Subsidiaries have been so filed, maintained
or furnished. All such reports, documents, claims, and notices were complete
and correct in all material respects on the date filed (or were corrected in
or supplemented by a subsequent filing) such that no liability exists with
respect to such filing.   

(iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any FDA
Form 483s, notice of adverse findings, Warning Letters, untitled letters or
other correspondence or notices from the FDA, or other Governmental Entity
alleging or asserting noncompliance with any applicable Laws or Permit.   

(iv) All studies, tests, preclinical and clinical trials being conducted by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are being conducted in material
compliance with experimental protocols, procedures and controls pursuant to
accepted professional scientific standards and applicable Law.   

(v) Since August 31, 2004, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not, either
voluntarily or involuntarily, initiated, conducted, or issued, or caused to
be initiated, conducted or issued, any material recall, market withdrawal or
replacement, safety alert, warning, "dear doctor" letter, investigator notice
or other notice or action relating to an alleged lack of safety or efficacy
of any product or product candidate, and, since August 31, 2004, to the
Knowledge of the Company (which, for purposes of this Section 3.01(j)(v),
shall include the actual Knowledge of the individuals listed on Section
3.01(j)(v) of the Company Disclosure Letter) there has been no manufacturing
or design defect arising from the manufacturing of products by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries which would be reasonably likely to result in any of
the foregoing and that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries
are not aware of any facts which are reasonably likely to cause (1) the
recall, market withdrawal or replacement of any product sold or intended to be
sold by the Company or its Subsidiaries; (2) a change in the marketing
classification or a material change in labeling of any such products; or (3)
a termination or suspension of marketing of any such products.   

(k) _Environmental Matters_. Except for those matters that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect: (A) each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any written communication alleging that the Company is in violation
of, or has any liability under, any Environmental Law which is pending and
unresolved; (B) each of the Company and its Subsidiaries validly possesses
and is in compliance with all Permits required under Environmental Laws to
conduct its business as presently conducted, and all such Permits are
valid and in good standing; (C) there are no Environmental Claims pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, overly threatened against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries; (D) during the period of ownership or operation by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any of its currently or formerly owned,
leased or operated properties or facilities, there have been no Releases
of Hazardous Materials on or from such properties or facilities which would
reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any liability under any Environmental Law or require any expenditure by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to remediate such Releases of Hazardous
Materials pursuant to Environmental Law; and (E) neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has received any unresolved written request for information,
demand or notification that any of them is or may be potentially responsible
for the investigation or cleanup of a Release of Hazardous Materials in
connection with its business. The representation and warranties contained in
this Section 3.01(k) shall be the exclusive representation and warranties with
respect to environmental matters.   

The term " _Environmental Claims_ " means any administrative or judicial
actions, suits, orders, claims, proceedings or written notices of
noncompliance by or from any Person alleging liability arising out of the
Release of any Hazardous Material or the failure to comply with
any Environmental Law. The term " _Environmental Law_ " means any Law
relating to pollution, the environment or natural resources. The term "

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to
Parent complete and correct copies of (A) each material Company Benefit Plan

the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Company Pension Plans

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, none of the Company, any of its
ERISA Affiliates or any officer of the Company or any such ERISA Affiliate

imposed by such Section 4975 of the Code or to any liability under applicable
Law. With respect to each Company Pension Plan, no "reportable event" (as
such term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) or no "accumulated
funding deficiency" (as such term is defined in Section 412(a) of the Code)
as of the date of the most recent actuarial report for such Company Pension

with respect to employees or former employees (or any of his or her
beneficiaries) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after retirement or
other termination of service (other than coverage or benefits (i) required to
be provided under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or any other similar applicable
Law or (ii) the full cost of which is borne by the employee or former

that if, after a request from the Company, Parent prohibits the Company from
making any such payment, discharge, settlement or satisfaction proposed by the
Company, or directs the Company to take an action with respect to any such
Actions, liabilities or obligations, then any adverse development with
respect to such subject Action, liabilities or obligation shall not be

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or

operations prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct Parents or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective
operations.   

Section 4.02. _No Solicitation_. (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors or officers or employees, and shall not authorize any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or
representative (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") retained by it or any
of its Subsidiaries to and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
such Representatives not to, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or
take any other action designed to knowingly facilitate the submission of any
Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding or furnish to any Person (other
than Parent or its Representatives or the Companys Representatives) any
confidential information with respect to, or otherwise actively cooperate in
any way with, any Takeover Proposal or (iii) waive, terminate or modify any
provision of any contractual "standstill" or similar obligation of any person
other than Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder
Approval, the Company may, in response to a bona fide written Takeover
Proposal that the Company Board determines (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor) is or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Proposal and which Takeover Proposal was not solicited
after the date hereof and was made after the date hereof and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.02(a), and subject
to compliance with Section 4.02(c), (i) furnish confidential information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (which shall permit the Company to comply with the
terms of Section 4.02(c)) not less restrictive to such Person than the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ that all such
information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such
Person and (ii) participate in discussions and negotiations with the Person
making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Takeover Proposal.   

The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
third party relating to any direct or indirect acquisition by such third
party (or in the case of a direct merger between such third party and the
Company, the equity holders of such third party), including by way of any
merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition,
asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or similar
transaction, of (i) assets that constitute or represent 15% or more of the
total revenue or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
or (ii) 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or of
any class of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, one or
more of the Subsidiaries of the Company which, in the aggregate, directly or
indirectly hold the assets referred to in clause (i) above, in each case
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

(b) The Company Board shall not (i) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in
a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the recommendation by the Company Board of
this Agreement or the Merger or resolve or agree to take any such action or
(B) adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to adopt or recommend, any
Takeover Proposal (any such action, resolution or agreement being referred to
herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), unless the Company Board
determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor) that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
(ii) recommend, adopt, approve or enter into any Takeover Proposal, or
propose publicly to recommend, adopt, approve or enter into any Takeover
Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such action or (iii) cause or permit
the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other agreement constituting or related to any Takeover Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement). Notwithstanding this Section 4.02(b)
or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to
obtaining the Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may, in response to a
Superior Proposal, cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(f); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) or
make an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Takeover Proposal
until after (i) the period of five calendar days following Parents receipt
of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board has
received a Superior Proposal, identifying the Person making such Superior
Proposal, stating that the Company Board intends to take such action and
specifying the material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is
the basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors (it being
understood and agreed that any material amendment to the financial terms or
any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written
notice of a Superior Proposal and a new five calendar day period), (ii)
during such five calendar day period, if requested by Parent, the Company has
engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in
such a manner that the Takeover Proposal which was determined to constitute a
Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal and (iii) a determination
by the Company Board that the Takeover Proposal described in such written
notice constitutes a Superior Proposal after taking into account any changes
to this Agreement proposed and irrevocably committed to by Parent during such
five calendar day period, as a result of the negotiations required by clause
(ii) or otherwise.   

The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer made by a
third party which the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) to be more
favorable to the shareholders of the Company than the Merger (taking into
account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement,
including all financial, legal and regulatory terms and conditions and the
likelihood and timing of consummation thereof (including any changes to the
financial terms of this Agreement proposed and irrevocably committed to by
Parent in response to such offer or otherwise)).   

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections
4.02(a) and 4.02(b), the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable
advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any Takeover Proposal
after the date of this Agreement, the material terms and conditions of any
such Takeover Proposal and the identity of the Person making any such
Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the
material details of any such Takeover Proposal (including any material
changes thereto) and provide Parent with any documents describing or
evidencing any such Takeover Proposal as promptly as reasonably
practicable.   

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if, in the
good faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisor), failure to so disclose would reasonably
be expected to violate its obligations under applicable Law or is otherwise
required under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such
disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act), which would otherwise constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change,
shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company
Board expressly reaffirms the recommendation by the Company Board of this
Agreement and the Merger at least two business days prior to
the Shareholders Meeting (after giving effect to any postponement or
adjournment thereof) if Parent has delivered to the Company a written request
to so reaffirm at least 48 hours (or if 48 hours is impracticable, as far in
advance as is practicable) prior to the time such reaffirmation is to
be made.   

ARTICLE V    

Additional Agreements    

Section 5.01. _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders  Meeting_.
(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement. Parent shall provide to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Sub as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection
with the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the
Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and resolution of comments
referred to below. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt
of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the
SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information and shall provide Parent with copies
of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the shareholders of the Company as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement. Prior to filing or mailing
the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to
any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on such document or response.   

(b) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement and the date on which the Proxy Statement is cleared
by the SEC for mailing in definitive form to shareholders of the Company,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders
(the " _Shareholders  Meeting_") for the purpose of obtaining the
Shareholder Approval. Subject to the ability of the Company Board to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 4.02(b), the Company shall,
through the Company Board, recommend to its shareholders the approval of this
Agreement and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the terms of
this Agreement, the Companys obligations pursuant to the first sentence of
this Section 5.01(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Takeover
Proposal or an Adverse Recommendation Change.   

Section 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall
afford to Parent, and to Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
consultants, financial advisors and other Representatives, reasonable access
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or
the termination of this Agreement to all of its and its
Subsidiaries properties, books, personnel and records, and during such
period, the Company shall furnish as promptly as reasonably practicable to
Parent all information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request (which shall not
include any environmental testing or sampling). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required
to provide access to or disclose information where the Company reasonably
determines that such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or
any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.
Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the
confidentiality letter agreement, dated as of May 18, 2007, between Parent and
the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), Parent shall hold, and shall cause its partners, members,
directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors (including financial and
legal advisors, consultants and accountants), controlling Persons, financing
sources and other Representatives to hold, all information received from the
Company or its Representatives, directly or indirectly, in confidence in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.   

Section 5.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the
taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to
be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity and (iii) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Parent,
Sub and the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable duly file
with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_
") the notification and report form required under the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable under the circumstances to any inquiries received from the FTC or
the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation and to all
inquiries and requests received from either Governmental Entity, (ii) not
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act without the prior written consent
of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) and (iii) not enter into any agreement with any Governmental
Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent and the Company shall,
from the date of this Agreement until the Outside Date, use their respective
reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have lifted, vacated or
terminated, any injunction or Judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay
the Closing.   

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 5.03(a) and (b), if any objections are asserted or if
any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private
party with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby that would
prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Sub and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and cause their Affiliates
to use their reasonable best efforts, to resolve any such objections or suits
so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including by selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of or
conducting its business in a manner which would resolve such objections or
suits, agreeing to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct its
business in a manner which would resolve such objections or suits or
permitting the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any of its
assets or the assets of its Subsidiaries or the conducting of its business in
a manner which would resolve such objections or suits;  _provided_ that any
such action with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries shall
be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.   

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Sub agrees that, between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, except as permitted by Section 4.02, they
shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,
take any action that, individually or in the aggregate, would, or would
reasonably be expected to, prevent or materially impede, interfere with,
hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   

Section 5.04. _Employee Matters_. (a) Parent covenants and agrees that, from
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor in accordance with its terms, each Company Benefit
Agreement and Company Benefit Plan and all obligations thereunder, subject to
any and all retained and reserved rights to amend or terminate any
such Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement under the terms
thereof, including any obligations arising as a result of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and Parent acknowledges that the
consummation of the Merger constitutes a change in control or change of
control, as the case may be, for all purposes under the Company Benefit Plans
and Company Benefit Agreements.   

(b) Subject and in addition to any applicable collective bargaining
agreements, for a period of not less than one year following the Effective
Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide (i)
base salary to each Person who is an active employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") that is no less favorable than that in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) severance benefits to each
Continuing Employee that are no less favorable than those that would have
been provided to such Continuing Employee under the applicable severance
benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements and arrangements as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) employee benefit plans and
arrangements (including bonus opportunities) to each Continuing Employee that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to each Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation nor any of their Subsidiaries shall have
any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the
issuance of, shares of capital stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation
rights or other rights in respect of any shares of capital stock of
any entity or any securities convertible or exchangeable into such shares
pursuant to any such plans or arrangements; _provided_ , _further_ , that no
plans or arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for
such issuance shall be taken into account in determining whether employee
benefits are no less favorable in the aggregate. The provisions of this
Section 5.04 are solely for the benefit of the parties to the Agreement, and
no employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose
as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement as a result of this
Section 5.04. Nothing herein shall require Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to continue to sponsor any particular benefit plan or arrangement
or to continue to provide for accrual of defined benefit pension
benefits.   

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall give or cause to be given
to each Continuing Employee full credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate, early retirement eligibility and early retirement subsidies,
vesting and level of benefits but not benefit accrual other than for vacation
and severance under any employee benefit plans and arrangements
provided, maintained or contributed to by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, for such Continuing Employees most
recent continuous period of service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the
extent such credit would result in duplication of benefits for the same
period of service.   

(d) With respect to any employee welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
and actively-at-work requirements with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees and their dependents and
beneficiaries under such plan to the extent waived under the applicable
corresponding Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents
and beneficiaries with credit under such plan for any co-payments and
deductibles paid under corresponding Company Benefit Plans prior to the
Effective Time in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
(and any annual and lifetime maximums).   

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be entitled to amend,
modify or terminate any Company Benefit Agreement or Company Benefit Plan or
to adopt or enter into replacement Company Benefit Agreements or Company
Benefit Plans and to establish trusts to fund the Companys obligations under
any Company Benefit Agreement or Company Benefit Plan, in each case, as
the Company determines necessary or desirable to comply with Section 409A of
the Code or any regulation or other authority promulgated thereunder,
_provided_ that such actions shall not materially increase the Companys
liabilities or obligations under the Company Benefit Agreements and
Company Benefit Plans.   

Section 5.05. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. (a) All rights
to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company as provided
in the Company Articles, the Company By-laws or any indemnification agreement
between such directors, officers or employees and the Company (in each case,
as in effect on the date of this Agreement) shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, without further action, as of the Effective Time
and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.   

(b) The articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of individuals who were directors,
officers or employees prior to the Effective Time than are presently set
forth in the Company Articles and the Company By-laws, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any such individuals.   

(c) From and after the Effective Time, in the event of any pending, threatened
or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any
Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made
a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of,
or pertaining to the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, shall indemnify
and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each such
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any
such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.
Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification could be
sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise
or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such
settlement, compromise or consent. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cooperate with an Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for
which such Indemnified Party could seek indemnification hereunder. Parents
and the Surviving Corporations obligations under this Section 5.05(c) shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation asserted or made prior to the Effective Time or within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.   

(d) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect
the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering
each Person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy (a complete and correct copy of which has been
heretofore delivered to Parent), on terms, including with respect to coverage
and amount, no less favorable to such directors and officers in any material
respect than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies of
Parent containing terms, including with respect to coverage and amount, no
less favorable to such directors and officers; _provided_ _further_ _however_
, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for
such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual
