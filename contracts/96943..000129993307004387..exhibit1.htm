<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;), dated as of July&nbsp;20,
2007, among Teleflex Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;), AM Sub Inc., a
Pennsylvania corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<U>Sub</U>&#148;), and Arrow

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Sub has approved this
Agreement and the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;), upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding
share of common stock, no par value, of the Company (&#147;<U>Company Common Stock</U>&#148;), other than
shares of Company Common Stock directly owned by Parent, Sub or any Subsidiary of the Company or
held by the Company as treasury shares, will be converted into the right to receive $45.50 in cash;
and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to
the Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt">ARTICLE I



<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt">The Merger



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.01. <U>The Merger</U>. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as
amended (the &#147;<U>PBCL</U>&#148;), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time.
Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease, and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the &#147;<U>Surviving Corporation</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.02. <U>Closing</U>. The closing of the Merger (the &#147;<U>Closing</U>&#148;) will take
place at 10:00&nbsp;a.m., New York time, on the first business day after satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article&nbsp;VI (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions) at the offices of Dechert LLP, Cira Centre,
2929 Arch Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in
writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the &#147;<U>Closing Date</U>&#148;.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.03. <U>Effective Time</U>. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
promptly as reasonably practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the Department
of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania articles of merger (the &#147;<U>Articles of Merger</U>&#148;)
in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the
PBCL and shall make all other filings and recordings required under the PBCL. The Merger shall
become effective at such date and time as the Articles of Merger are filed with the Department of
State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective
is referred to in this Agreement as the &#147;<U>Effective Time</U>&#148;.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.04. <U>Effects of the Merger</U>. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Chapter&nbsp;19 of the PBCL.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.05. <U>Articles of Incorporation and By-laws</U>. (a)&nbsp;The Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation of the Company (the &#147;<U>Company Articles</U>&#148;), shall be amended at the
Effective Time to be in the form of <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> and, as so amended, shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;The by-laws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.06. <U>Directors</U>. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.07. <U>Officers</U>. The officers of the Company as of the date of this Agreement
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt">ARTICLE II



<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt">Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the



<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt">Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates; Adjustments;



<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt">Company Stock Options



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.01. <U>Effect on Capital Stock</U>. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any
shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Capital Stock of Sub</U>. Each share of capital stock of Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Cancellation of Treasury Stock, Parent-Owned Stock and Sub-Owned Stock</U>. Each
share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by Parent or Sub or held by the Company as
treasury shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share
of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Conversion of Company Common Stock</U>. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares to be canceled or converted
in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.01(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive $45.50 in cash,
without interest (the &#147;<U>Merger Consideration</U>&#148;). At the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a &#147;<U>Certificate</U>&#148;) shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
and any dividends or other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may
have been authorized by the Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.02. <U>Exchange of Certificates</U>. (a) <U>Paying Agent</U>. Prior to the
Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to
act as paying agent (the &#147;<U>Paying Agent</U>&#148;) for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the
Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration as and when
required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
&#147;<U>Exchange Fund</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Exchange Procedures</U>. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate: (i)&nbsp;a
letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate
shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the
right to receive pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any fiduciary or surety bonds or any transfer or other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that
such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the
right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this Article&nbsp;II and any dividends or
other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been authorized
by the Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. No interest shall be paid or will
accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock</U>. All cash paid upon the
surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article&nbsp;II shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation&#146;s
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time which may have been authorized by the Company and which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be cancelled
against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this Article&nbsp;II.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Termination of the Exchange Fund</U>. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for 12&nbsp;months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have
not theretofore complied with this Article&nbsp;II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent
shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this Article&nbsp;II.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;<U>No Liability</U>. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered
to a public official in compliance with any applicable state, Federal or other abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on
which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;<U>Investment of Exchange Fund</U>. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that such investments shall
be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody&#146;s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard &#038;
Poor&#146;s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker&#146;s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1&nbsp;billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available). Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent. Nothing contained
herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the
rights of any holder of Certificates to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(g)&nbsp;<U>Lost Certificates</U>. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond or surety in
such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(h)&nbsp;<U>Withholding Rights</U>. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Person, as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.03. <U>Company Stock Options</U>. As promptly as reasonably practicable following
the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;<U>Company Board</U>&#148;)
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions
as it may deem necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each unexercised Company Stock
Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, with the
holder of each such Company Stock Option becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash (the
&#147;<U>Option Amount</U>&#148;) equal to (i)&nbsp;the excess, if any, of (A)&nbsp;the Merger Consideration over (B)
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option,
multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option. In the event that the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock
Option shall be cancelled and have no further force or effect. Each holder of a Company Stock
Option shall receive from the Surviving Corporation and shall be paid as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time, without interest, the Option Amount, net of any required
withholding of Tax or proof of eligibility for exemption therefrom.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt">ARTICLE III



<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt">Representations and Warranties



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;3.01. <U>Representations and Warranties of the Company</U>. Except as disclosed (i)

outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii)
recommend, adopt, approve or enter into any Takeover Proposal, or propose publicly to recommend,
adopt, approve or enter into any Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such action or

anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder
Approval, the Company Board may, in response to a Superior Proposal, cause the Company to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement

Proposal and a new five calendar day period), (ii)&nbsp;during such five calendar day period, if
requested by Parent, the Company has engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that the Takeover Proposal which was determined to constitute a Superior
Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal and (iii)&nbsp;a determination by the Company Board that the
Takeover Proposal described in such written notice constitutes a Superior Proposal after taking
into account any changes to this Agreement proposed and irrevocably committed to by Parent during
such five calendar day period, as a result of the negotiations required by clause (ii)&nbsp;or
otherwise.

(taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement, including
all financial, legal and regulatory terms and conditions and the likelihood and timing of
consummation thereof (including any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed and
irrevocably committed to by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise)).

Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the material details of any such
Takeover Proposal (including any material changes thereto) and provide Parent with any documents
describing or evidencing any such Takeover Proposal as promptly as reasonably practicable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;Nothing contained in this Section&nbsp;4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Company from (i)&nbsp;taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule&nbsp;14d-9 or
Rule&nbsp;14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)&nbsp;making any disclosure to its shareholders
if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor), failure to so disclose would reasonably be expected to violate its
obligations under applicable Law or is otherwise required under applicable Law; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that any such disclosure (other than a &#147;stop, look and listen&#148; communication or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule&nbsp;14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act), which
would otherwise constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change, shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms the recommendation by the
Company Board of this Agreement and the Merger at least two business days prior to the
Shareholders&#146; Meeting (after giving effect to any postponement or adjournment thereof) if Parent
has delivered to the Company a written request to so reaffirm at least 48 hours (or if 48 hours is
impracticable, as far in advance as is practicable) prior to the time such reaffirmation is to be
made.

Approval. Subject to the ability of the Company Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
