Affiliate Letter     iv     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND
REORGANIZATION, dated as of October 24, 2004 (this "Agreement"), among Ispat
International N.V., a company organized under the laws of The Netherlands
("Parent"), Park Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and International Steel Group Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company").   WHEREAS, Parent is entering into an
acquisition agreement (the "Richmond Agreement") with Richmond Investment
Holdings Limited ("Richmond"), a company organized under the laws of the
British Virgin Islands, for the purchase by Parent of all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of LNM Holdings N.V., a company organized under the
laws of The Netherlands Antilles (the "LNM Transaction");   WHEREAS, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance
with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"),
Parent and the Company desire to effect a business combination transaction
pursuant to which, following the completion of LNM Transaction (the "LNM
Closing") and in conjunction therewith, the Company will merge with and into
Merger Sub (the "Merger") and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent;  
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has (i)
determined that the Merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-
term business strategy of the Company and fair to, and in the best interests
of, the Company and its stockholders and has approved this Agreement and (ii)
recommended the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of
the Company;   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent (the "Parent
Board") has (i) determined that the Merger is consistent with and in
furtherance of the long-term business strategy of Parent and fair to, and in
the best interests of, Parent and its stockholders and has approved this
Agreement and (ii) recommended the approval of the issuance of shares in the
Merger and the LNM Transaction by the shareholders of Parent;   WHEREAS,
Parent, and certain stockholders of the Company (the "Stockholders") have
entered into a Company Shareholder Support Agreement, dated as of the date
hereof (the "Company Shareholder Support Agreement"), providing that, among
other things, the Stockholders will vote their Company Shares in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement;   WHEREAS, the Company, and a certain
shareholder of Parent (the "Parent Shareholder"), have entered into a voting
agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the "Parent Shareholder Support
Agreement"), providing that, among other things, the Parent Shareholder will
vote its Parent Class A Shares and Parent Class B Shares in favor of adoption
of the Richmond Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder and
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder;   WHEREAS, the
Company and Richmond have entered into a support agreement, dated as of the
date hereof (the "LNM Shareholder Support Agreement"), providing
representations and warranties to the Company from Richmond; and     
WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, the Merger is
intended to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section
368(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), or alternatively, together with the LNM Transaction, as transfers of
property described in Section 351(a) (subject to Section 351(b)) of the
Code;   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:  
ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   SECTION 1.01 The Merger. (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII, and in accordance with
the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into
Merger Sub, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and
Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation"); provided, however, that if either of the conditions
set forth in Section 1.01(b) (after taking into account the application, if
any, of the final sentence of Section 1.01(b)) is satisfied, Parent shall,
reverse the business combination structure referred to herein as the "Merger"
so that Merger Sub will instead merge with and into the Company. In such
event, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the
Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation of the Merger (a
"Reverse-Subsidiary Merger"). A Reverse-Subsidiary Merger would be intended
to be integrated with the LNM Transaction and treated as a transaction
described in Section 351(a) of the Code, and, unless waived by the Company,
the condition of Section 7.03(d) hereof would relate to the qualification of
the acquisition under Section 351(a) of the Code and the condition in 7.02(f)
shall be waived. In the event Parent effects the acquisition of the Company
pursuant to a Reverse Subsidiary Merger, all references to the "Merger" in
this Agreement and all other ancillary or related agreements, documents and
instruments, shall be deemed to be references to the "Reverse-Subsidiary
Merger", all references to the "Surviving Corporation" shall be deemed to be
to the "Company" as the Surviving Corporation of the Merger, and this
Agreement and such other ancillary agreements, documents and
instruments shall be construed and interpreted accordingly.   (b)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent
may effect the acquisition of the Company pursuant to the Reverse-Subsidiary
Merger if either of the following two conditions is satisfied: (i) Parent
reasonably determines that the value of the Stock Consideration on the date
of the Effective Time (such value, the "Stock Value") is likely to be less
than 42.5% (the "Minimum Percentage") of the sum of (A) the Stock Value, (B)
the Cash Consideration, (C) any other amounts paid by Parent or the Company
(or any affiliate thereof) to, or on behalf of, any Stockholder in connection
with the sale, redemption or other disposition of any Company Shares in
connection with the Merger for purposes of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-1(e) (including payments with respect to Dissenting Shares) and
(D) any extraordinary dividends distributed by the Company prior to, and in
connection with, the Merger for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(e) or (ii) Parent or the Company receives written notice from its
counsel specified in Article VII to the effect that such counsel is unlikely
to be able to deliver a tax opinion required pursuant to Section 7.02(f)
or     2   Section 7.03(d), as the case may be, on the date of the
Effective Time. For purposes hereof, Parent shall have the right, at its sole
and absolute discretion, to increase the Stock Consideration to the extent
necessary (as reasonably determined by Parent based on the advice of its
counsel) to cause the Stock Value to at least equal the Minimum Percentage
(which determination shall be made based on the average of the high and low
trading prices for Parent Class A Shares on the date of the Effective Time
or, if the Closing occurs before the opening of the markets, the last
business day immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time).  
SECTION 1.02 Effective Time; Closing. As promptly as practicable after the
satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as is required
by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the
date and time of such filing of the Certificate of Merger (or such later time
as may be agreed by each of the parties hereto and specified in the
Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time"). Immediately prior to the
filing of the Certificate of Merger, a closing (the "Closing") shall be held
at the offices of Shearman and Sterling LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York,
New York 10022, or such other place as the parties shall agree, for the
purpose of confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as the case may be, of the
conditions set forth in Article VII.   SECTION 1.03 Effect of the Merger.
At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.04 Certificate of
Incorporation; By-laws. (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of Merger Sub, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 1.04(a),
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by Law and such Certificate of Incorporation.
In the event of a Reverse-Subsidiary Merger, the reference to "Merger Sub" in
this subparagraph (a) shall be replaced by a reference to "the Company".  
(b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the
Effective Time, the By-laws of Merger Sub, in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 1.04(b), shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by Law, the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation and such By-laws.   SECTION 1.05 Directors and
Officers. (a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to
hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws
of the Surviving Corporation.    3    (b) The officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal.   ARTICLE II  CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES   SECTION 2.01 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following
securities:   (a) Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. Each share 
of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the  "Company
Common Stock") issued and outstanding and owned by Merger Sub,  Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or  of the Company (all
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common  Stock being hereinafter
collectively referred to as the "Company  Shares") and each share of Company
Common Stock held in the treasury of  the Company, immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled  without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be  made with respect thereto.   (b) Shares
of Merger Sub Stock. Each share of common stock,  par value $0.01 per share,
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and  exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of  common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.   (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each
Company Share  (other than any Company Shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section  2.01(a)) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically, 
subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 1.01(a), this Section  2.01
and Section 2.02, into the right to receive (i) $42.00 in cash  (the "Cash
Consideration") or (ii) an amount of Class A Shares (the  "Exchange Ratio"),
par value (E)0.01 per share ("Parent Class A  Shares") of Parent (the "Stock
Consideration") equal to the quotient  determined by dividing $42.00 by the
Average Parent Stock Price and  rounding the result to the nearest one
thousandth of a share, payable  upon surrender, in the manner provided in
Section 2.02, of the  certificate that formerly evidenced such Company Share;
provided,  however, that if such quotient is less than 0.95865, the Exchange
Ratio  will be 0.95865 and if such quotient is greater than 1.21740, the 
Exchange Ratio will be 1.21740, or (iii) a combination of cash and  Parent
Class A Shares determined in accordance with this Section 2.01  (the "Mixed
Consideration", together with the Cash Consideration and  Stock Consideration
elected by a holder of a Company Share as set forth  above shall be referred
to as, the "Merger Consideration"), payable  upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 2.02, of the  certificate that formerly evidenced such
Company Share. The "Average  Parent Stock Price" means the average of the per
share closing prices  of Parent Class A Shares on the NYSE during the 20
consecutive trading  days ending on (and including) the trading day that is
two days prior  to the date of the Effective Time.   4    (d) Cash
Election. Each record holder of Company Shares  immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be entitled to elect to  receive cash for all or any
part of such holder\'s Company Shares (a  "Cash Election"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing and subject to Section  1.01(a) and Section 2.01(l), the
aggregate number of Company Shares  that may be converted into the right to
receive cash in the Merger (the  "Cash Election Number") shall be 50% of the
total number of shares of  Company Shares issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.   (e) Cash Election Shares. If the aggregate number of
Company  Shares covered by Cash Elections (the "Cash Election Shares")
exceeds  the Cash Election Number, each Cash Election Share shall be
converted  into (i) the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest,  equal to the product of (A) the Cash Consideration and (B) a
fraction  (the "Cash Fraction"), the numerator of which shall be the Cash 
Election Number and the denominator of which shall be the total number  of
Cash Election Shares and (ii) a number of Parent Class A Shares  equal to the
product of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) a fraction equal  to one minus the
Cash Fraction.   (f) Stock Election. Each record holder of Company Shares 
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to elect to 
receive Parent Class A Shares for all or any part of such holder\'s  Company
Shares (a "Stock Election"). Notwithstanding the foregoing and  subject to
Section 1.01(a) and Section 2.01(l), the aggregate number of  Company Shares
that may be converted into the right to receive Parent  Class A Shares in the
Merger (the "Stock Election Number") shall be 50%  of the total number of
Company Shares issued and outstanding as of the  Effective Time.   (g)
Stock Election Shares. If the aggregate number of Company  Shares covered by
Stock Elections (the "Stock Election Shares") exceeds  the Stock Election
Number, each Stock Election Share shall be converted  into (i) the right to
receive a number of Parent Class A Shares equal  to the product of (A) the
Exchange Ratio and (B) a fraction (the "Stock  Fraction"), the numerator of
which shall be the Stock Election Number  and the denominator of which shall
be the total number of Stock  Election Shares and (ii) an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to  the product of (A) the Cash Consideration and (B)
a fraction equal to  one minus the Stock Fraction.   (h) Mixed Election.
Each record holder of Company Shares  immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be entitled to elect to  receive Parent Class A Shares for part of such
holder\'s Company Shares  and cash for the remaining part of such holder\'s
Company Shares (a  "Mixed Election" and, collectively with a Stock Election
and Cash  Election, the "Election"). Notwithstanding the foregoing and
subject to  Section 1.01(a) and Section 2.01(l), the aggregate number of
Company  Shares that may be converted into the right to receive the Cash 
Consideration shall be 50%, and the aggregate number of Company Shares  that
may be converted into the right to receive Parent Class A Shares  in the
Merger shall be 50%, in each case, of the total number of  Company Shares
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. With  respect to each holder
of Company Shares who makes a Mixed Election,  each Company Share (or
fraction thereof) such holder elects to be  converted into the right to
receive Cash Consideration shall be treated  as a Cash Election Share for
purposes of the provisions contained in  Sections 2.01(c), (d) and    
5    (e), and each Company Share (or fraction thereof) such holder elects 
to be converted into the right to receive Parent Class A Shares shall  be
treated as a Stock Election Share for purposes of the provisions  contained
in Sections 2.01(c), (f) and (g).   (i) Form of Elections. Cash Elections,
Stock Elections and  Mixed Elections shall be made on a form designed for
that purpose (a  "Form of Election"). A record holder of Company Shares who
holds such  shares as nominee or trustee or in another representative
capacity (a  "Stockholder\'s Representative") may submit multiple Forms of
Election;  provided that such Stockholder\'s Representative certifies that
each  such Form of Election covers all the Company Shares held by such 
Stockholder\'s Representative for a particular beneficial owner.   (j)
Deemed Non-Election. For the purposes hereof, a holder of  Company Shares who
does not submit a Form of Election that is received  by the Paying Agent
prior to the Election Deadline (the "No Election  Shares") shall be deemed
not to have made a Cash Election, Stock  Election or Mixed Election. If
Parent or the Paying Agent shall  determine that any purported Election was
not properly made, the shares  subject to such improperly made Election shall
be treated as No  Election Shares. No Election Shares, at the discretion of
Parent, may  be treated as Cash Election Shares or Stock Election Shares;
provided,  however, that if the effect of such treatment would be to cause
Section  1.01(b) to apply, then Parent shall not apply such treatment
without  the consent of the Company.   (k) Election Deadline. Each of
Parent and the Company shall  use its reasonable best efforts to cause copies
of the Form of Election  to be mailed to the record holders of Company Shares
not less than  thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time and to make the
Form of  Election available to all persons who become record holders of
Company  Shares subsequent to the date of such mailing and no later than
the  close of business on the seventh business day prior to the Effective 
Time. Parent and the Company shall be deemed to have made the Form of 
Election available for purposes of this Agreement if they post such  form on
their respective websites in a downloadable format. A Form of  Election must
be received by the Paying Agent by 5:00 p.m., New York  City time, on the
third day after the Effective Time (the "Election  Deadline") in order to be
effective. All elections may be revoked until  the Election Deadline in
writing by the record holders submitting Forms  of Election.   (l) Anti-
Dilution Provisions. In the event Parent (i) changes  (or establishes a
record date for changing) the number of Parent Class  A Shares issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result  of a stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any  dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Parent Class A  Shares or Company Shares),
extraordinary dividends, stock combination,  recapitalization,
reclassification, reorganization combination,  exchange of shares or similar
transaction or like change with respect  to the Parent Class A Shares or
Company Shares or (ii) pays or makes an  extraordinary dividend or
distribution in respect of Parent Class A  Shares (other than a distribution
referred to in clause (i) of this  sentence) and, in either case, the record
date therefor shall be prior  to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration
shall be  proportionately adjusted. Regular quarterly cash dividends and 
increases thereon not prohibited by Section 5.02(b)(ii) of this  Agreement
shall not be considered extraordinary     6    for purposes of the
preceding sentence. If, between the date hereof and  the Effective Time,
Parent shall merge or consolidate with or into any  other corporation (a
"Parent Business Combination") and the terms  thereof shall provide that
Parent Class A Shares shall be converted  into the shares of any other
corporation or entity, then provision  shall be made so that stockholders of
the Company who would be entitled  to receive Parent Class A Shares pursuant
to this Agreement shall be  entitled to receive, in lieu of each Parent Class
A Share issuable to  such shareholders as provided herein, the same kind and
amount of  securities or assets as shall be distributable upon such Parent 
Business Combination with respect to Parent Class A Shares and the  parties
hereto shall agree on an appropriate restructuring of the  transactions
contemplated herein.   SECTION 2.02 Exchange of Certificates and Cash
Consideration. (a) Exchange Agent. Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the
holders of Company Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article II
through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the Parent Class A
Shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 as of the Effective Time, and cash,
from time to time as required to make payments in respect of the Cash
Consideration and payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.02(e) (such cash and certificates for Parent Class A Shares,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Parent Class A Shares and
cash payments contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.01 out of the
Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Section 2.02(f) hereof, the Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.   (b) Exchange Procedures. As
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Company Shares entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c): (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Company Shares
(the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter
of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate
for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing that number of whole Parent Class A Shares which
such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Company Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate (after taking into account all
Company Shares then held by such holder), if any, cash in respect of the Cash
Consideration to be received by such holder, if any, cash in lieu of any
fractional Parent Class A Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02(e), any dividends or other     7   distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of Parent Class A
Shares, cash in respect of the Cash Consideration to be received by
such holder, if any, cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Class A Shares to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and any dividends
or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(c), may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such
Company Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at all
times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the certificate representing Parent Class A Shares, cash in
respect of the Cash Consideration to be received by such holder, if any, cash
in lieu of any fractional Parent Class A Shares to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(c).   (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Parent Class
A Shares. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Parent Class A Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the Parent Class A Shares represented thereby,
and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(e), until the holder of such Certificate
shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or
other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole Parent
Class A Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly,
the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional Parent Class A
Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such whole Parent Class A
Shares and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect
to such whole Parent Class A Shares.   (d) No Further Rights in Company
Common Stock. All Merger Consideration issued upon conversion of the Company
Shares in accordance with the terms hereof (together with cash paid pursuant
to Section 2.02(c) or Section 2.02(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares.   (e) No
Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip representing fractional Parent
Class A Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. Each
holder of a fractional share interest shall be paid an amount in cash
(without interest and subject to the amount of any withholding taxes as
contemplated in Section 2.02(h)) equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(i) such fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into
account all fractional share interests then held by such holder) would
otherwise be entitled by (ii) the Average Parent Stock Price. As promptly as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify
Parent, and Parent shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and
shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of
fractional share interests subject to and in accordance with the terms of
Sections 2.02(b) and (c). If this procedure has any adverse impact on whether
the Merger will qualify under Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e) then the
parties will amend the provision set forth in this Section    
8   2.02(e) to provide for a distribution of fractional shares to the
holders of Company Shares and the subsequent sale of such fractional Parent
Class A Shares.   (f) Termination of Exchange Fund and Additional Exchange
Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Shares who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Parent for the Parent Class A Shares, any Cash Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional Parent Class A Shares to which they are entitled pursuant
to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Class A Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c).
Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Company
Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any government entity shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free
and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.   (g) No Liability. None of the Exchange Agent, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Company Shares for
any such Company Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto),
or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.   (h) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Shares or Company Stock Options such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Shares or Company
Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.   (i) Lost
Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Parent Class A Shares to which the holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.01, any cash to which the holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01, any
cash in lieu of fractional Parent Class A Shares to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and any dividends or
other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02(c).   9    SECTION 2.03 Stock Transfer Books. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares
thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Company Shares, except as provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or
after the Effective Time, subject, with respect to the relevant holders of
Company Shares, their delivery of the Certificates required by Section 6.08
of this Agreement, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent
for any reason shall be converted into Parent Class A Shares, any cash in
respect of Cash Consideration elected, if any, any cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Class A Shares to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c).   SECTION 2.04 Company
Stock Options; Company SARs. (a) Each holder of an option (collectively, the
"Company Stock Options") outstanding, whether or not exercisable and whether
or not vested, at the Effective Time under the Company\'s 2002 Stock Option
Plan, dated as of June 28, 2002, as such plan may have been amended,
supplemented or modified prior to the date hereof (the "Company Stock Option
Plan"), will, in settlement of such Company Stock Option in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and in exchange for the surrender to
the Company of the certificate or other document evidencing such Company
Stock Options, receive from the Company for each Company Share subject to
such Company Stock Option, an amount (subject to any applicable
withholding tax) in cash equal to the difference between $42.00 and the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock, to the extent such
difference is a positive number. At the Effective Time, each outstanding and
unexercised Company Stock Option will be canceled whether or not the holder
thereof is entitled to Company Option Consideration under this Section
2.04(a) and the holders of Company Stock Options will have no further rights
in respect of any Company Stock Options. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event will payments under this Section 2.04(a) be taken into account in
determining the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration included in the Merger
Consideration.   (b) On or after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall take all necessary
action such that, with respect to each member of the Company Board and each
employee of the Company that is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act,
the acquisition by such person of Parent Class A Shares in the Merger and the
disposition by any such person of Parent Class A Shares or Company Stock
Options pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to and to the extent
permitted by Rule 16b-3 promulgated thereunder.   (c) At the Effective
Time, each stock appreciation right providing benefits measured by the value
of a number of shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Managers
Incentive Plan of the Company identified in Section 2.04 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (each, a "Company SAR"), whether vested or unvested,
which is outstanding or unsatisfied immediately prior to the Effective Time,
will cease to represent a right or award measured by the value of a number of
shares of Company Common Stock and will be converted, at the Effective Time,
into a right or award measured by the value of a number of shares of Parent
Class A Shares (an "Assumed Company SAR"), on the same terms and conditions
(including expiration date, vesting and payment provisions) as were
applicable under the Company SAR (but taking into account any
changes thereto, including the adjustments thereof,     10   provided
for in the Managers Incentive Plan of the Company or in any award agreement
thereunder by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby). The number of Parent Class A Shares by which each such Assumed
Company SAR is measured will be equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock by which the Company SAR is measured, multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole Parent Class A Share), and the
exercise price by which each such Assumed Company SAR is measured will be
equal to the exercise price by which the Company SAR is measured, divided by
the Exchange Ratio; provided, that the maximum value of each such Assumed
Company SAR shall not exceed the maximum value of the Company SAR. The
parties will take all actions required to implement this Section 2.02(c),
including any amendments to the Managers Incentive Plan of the Company to
ensure that the Company SARs are converted as provided in this Section
2.02(c).   SECTION 2.05 Appraisal Rights/Dissenting Shares.
(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to
the extent available under the DGCL, Company Shares that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who
shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in
writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such
Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration. Such stockholders shall be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of Dissenting Shares held by them in
accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all
Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or
who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of
such Dissenting Shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.02, of
the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Company
Shares.   (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of
any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received
by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.   SECTION 2.06 Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, no Parent Class A Shares shall be delivered to a person
who is an "affiliate" of the Company by the Company in accordance with
Section 6.09 hereof for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act until
such person has executed and delivered to Parent an executed copy of the
affiliate letter contemplated in Section 6.09 hereof.   ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company\'s disclosure
schedule (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub prior to the execution of this Agreement (which
schedule sets forth, with respect to each item disclosed therein, the
specific section of this     11   Agreement to which such item
relates), contains items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate
either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a
provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in this Article III, or to one or more of the Company\'s
covenants contained in Article V. Except as disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, or a Company SEC Report filed prior to the date hereof,
as an inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:  
SECTION 3.01 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. (a) Each of the
Company and each Material Company Subsidiary is a corporation or legal entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has the requisite
corporate, partnership or similar power and authority and all necessary
governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be
so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such power,
authority and governmental approvals would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and
each Material Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business
in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) A true and complete list of all the Material
Company Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization of each Material Company Subsidiary and which identifies the
percentage (direct or indirect) of equity ownership of each Material Company
Subsidiary owned by the Company and each other subsidiary, is set forth in
Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company does not
directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar
interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business
association or entity.   (c) Each subsidiary of the Company (each, a
"Company Subsidiary") that constitutes a significant subsidiary of the
Company within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") to the Company\'s business as a whole is
so identified in Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and is
referred to herein as a "Material Company Subsidiary".   12    SECTION
3.02 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. The Company has heretofore
made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Certificate of
Incorporation and the By-laws or equivalent organizational documents, each as
amended to date, of the Company and each Material Company Subsidiary. The
Certificates of Incorporation, By-laws or equivalent organizational documents
of the Company and each Material Company Subsidiary are in full force and
effect. Neither the Company nor any Material Company Subsidiary is in
material violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of
Incorporation, By-laws or equivalent organizational documents.   SECTION
3.03 Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of (i) 350,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) 7,000,000 shares of
Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company Class B Common
Stock") and (iii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
share ("Company Preferred Stock"). As of October 18, 2004, (i) 100,027,950

B Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (iii) no shares of Company Common

Common Stock were held by the Company Subsidiaries, (v) 4,275,510 shares of
Company Common Stock were reserved for future issuance pursuant
to outstanding Company Stock Options, (vi) 660,200 shares of Company Common
Stock were reserved for future issuance pursuant to the Company Stock Option
Plan and the Company Officer Stock and Cash Bonus Plan, and (vii) no shares
of Company Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. From October 18,
2004, to the date of this Agreement, the Company has not issued any shares of
Company Common Stock other than pursuant to the exercise of Company Stock
Options. Except as set forth in this Section 3.03, or the Company Shareholder
Support Agreement, there are no options, warrants or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the
issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or any Material Company
Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or
sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the
Company or any Material Company Subsidiary. Section 3.03(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth the following information with respect to each
Company Stock Option outstanding as of the date of this Agreement: (i) the
name of the Company Stock Option recipient; (ii) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option; (iii) the exercise
or purchase price of such Company Stock Option; (iv) the date on which such
Company Stock Option was granted; (v) the applicable vesting schedule; (vi)
the date on which such Company Stock Option expires; and (vii) whether the
exercisability of such Company Stock Option will be accelerated in any way by
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and indicates the extent of
acceleration. All shares of Company Common Stock subject to issuance as
aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in
the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no
outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock
or any capital stock of any Company Subsidiary or to provide a material
amount of funds to, or make any material investment (in the form of a loan,
capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Company Subsidiary or any other
person. There are no commitments or agreements of any character to which the
Company is bound obligating the Company to accelerate the vesting of any
Company Stock Award as a result of the Merger. All outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, all   13   outstanding Company Stock Awards, and
all outstanding shares of capital stock of each Material Company Subsidiary
have been issued and granted in compliance with (i) all applicable securities
laws and other applicable Laws and (ii) all requirements set forth in
applicable contracts.   (b) Each outstanding share of capital stock of each
Material Company Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable, and each such share is owned by the Company or another
Company Subsidiary free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims,
pledges, options, rights of first refusal, agreements, limitations on the
Company\'s or any Company Subsidiary\'s voting rights, charges and other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever other than Permitted Liens.   SECTION
3.04 Authority Relative to This Agreement. The Company has all necessary
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Transactions"). The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the then-
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, if and to the extent required by
applicable Law, and the filing and recordation of appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms. The Company Board has approved this Agreement and
the Transactions and such approvals are sufficient so that the restrictions
on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL shall not apply
to the Merger or any of the Transactions. To the knowledge of the Company, no
other state takeover statute is applicable to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 3.05 No Conflict;
Required Filings and Consents. (a) The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company does not, and the performance of this Agreement by
the Company will not, (i) conflict with or violate the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws or any equivalent organizational documents of the
Company or any Material Company Subsidiary, (ii) assuming that all consents,
approvals, authorizations and other actions described in Section 3.05(b) have
been obtained and all filings and obligations described in Section 3.05(b)
have been made, conflict with or violate any United States or non-United
States statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule, code, executive order,
injunction, judgment, decree or other order ("Law") applicable to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected or (iii) result in any breach of
or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would become a default) under, or give to others any right
of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in
the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of the
Company or any Material Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise
or other instrument or obligation, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and
(iii), for any such conflicts,     14   violations, breaches, defaults
or other occurrences which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b) The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by the
Company will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of,
or filing with or notification to, any United States federal, state, county
or local or non-United States government, governmental, regulatory or
administrative authority, agency, instrumentality or commission or any court,
tribunal, or judicial or arbitral body (a "Governmental Authority"), except
(i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, state
securities or "blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky Laws") and state takeover laws, the
pre-merger notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), the Foreign Merger
Filings and the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as
required by the DGCL and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings
or notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.06 Permits; Compliance. Each
of the Company and each Material Company Subsidiary is in possession of all
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental
Authority necessary for each of the Company or the Material Company
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted (the "Company Permits"), except where
the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Company
Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no suspension or
cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened, except where the failure to have, or the suspension
or cancellation of, any of the Company Permits would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default, breach or
violation of, (a) any Law applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or by which any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
bound or affected or (b) any Company Permit, except for any such conflicts,
defaults, breaches or violations that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.07 SEC
Filings; Financial Statements. (a) The Company has filed all forms, reports
and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since December 10,
2003. Each of (i) the Company\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2003, (ii) the Company\'s Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004, (iii) all
definitive proxy statements relating to the Company\'s meetings of
stockholders (whether annual or special) held since December 10, 2003,
(iv) its prospectus dated September 3, 2004 filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3)
of the Securities Act and (v) all other forms, reports and other
registration statements filed by the Company with the SEC since December 10,
2003 filed prior to the date hereof, (the forms, reports and other documents
referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) above being,
collectively, the "Company SEC Reports"), (A) were prepared in accordance
with either the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as the case may be, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (B) did not, at the time
they were filed, or, if amended or   15   supplemented, as of the date of
such amendment or supplement, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the
extent that information contained in any Company SEC Report has been
revised or superseded by a Company SEC Report filed as of a later date (but
before the date of this Agreement) and is publicly available. No Company
Subsidiary is required to file any form, report or other document with the
SEC.   (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements of the Company
together with the Company Subsidiaries (including, in each case, any notes
thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports was prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective
dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments in amounts that are immaterial in nature and amount and are
consistent with past experience).   (c) Except as and to the extent set
forth on any of (i) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as
of December 31, 2003 or (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company for the period ended June 30, 2004, each including the notes thereto
(the "Company 2003-4 Balance Sheets"), neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has any liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) that is required by GAAP to be recorded as
a liability on a balance sheet of the Company or disclosed in footnotes
thereto, except for liabilities and obligations, incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2004, which
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (d) The Company has
timely filed all certifications and statements required by (x) Rule 13a-14 or
Rule 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or (y) 18 U.S.C. Section 1350 (Section 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) with respect to any Company SEC Report.
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as required by Rule
13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, and such controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that all material information concerning
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to
the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company\'s SEC
filings. The Company has established and maintained a reporting system
permitting employees to anonymously report alleged accounting irregularities
and other matters as required by Law. As of the date hereof, the Company is
not conducting or required to conduct any investigation as a result of any
such report that, to the Company\'s knowledge, is reasonably likely to have a
material effect on the Company\'s past or future reported results
of operation or financial position. No attorney representing the Company or
any Company Subsidiary has reported evidence of a material violation of
securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company
or any of its executive officers or directors to the Company Board or any
committee thereof or to any director or executive officer of the Company.  
16    SECTION 3.08 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since December
10, 2003, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the Company
and the Material Company Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in
the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice in
all material respects, (b) there has not been any Company Material Adverse
Effect and (c) none of the Company or any Material Company Subsidiary has
taken any action that, if taken after the date of this Agreement, would
constitute a breach of any of the covenants set forth in Section 5.01(b)(ii),
(b)(iii), (b)(iv), (b)(v)(A), (b)(viii) or (b)(xii).   SECTION 3.09 Absence
of Litigation. There is no litigation, suit, claim, action, proceeding or
investigation (an "Action") pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any material
property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, before any
Governmental Authority that (a) individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (b) seeks to materially delay
or prevent the consummation of any of the Transactions. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary nor any material property or asset of the Company
or any Material Company Subsidiary is subject to any continuing order of,
consent decree, settlement agreement or other similar written agreement with,
or, to the knowledge of the Company, continuing investigation by, any
Governmental Authority, or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree,
determination or award of any Governmental Authority that would, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.10

appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained
in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in this Article IV, or to one or more of the Company\'s
covenants contained in Article V. Except as disclosed in the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, a Parent SEC Report filed prior to the date hereof, the

to the extent it is readily apparent that the items disclosed therein relate
to particular sections of this Agreement, as an inducement to the Company to

existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization and has the requisite corporate, partnership or
similar power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing or to have such power, authority and governmental approvals
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and each Material Parent Subsidiary is
duly qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where

jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each Material Parent
Subsidiary and which identifies the percentage (direct or indirect) of equity
ownership of each Material Parent Subsidiary owned by Parent, is set forth in

or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar
interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business
association or other entity, which entity, if it were a Parent Subsidiary,
would also be a Material Parent Subsidiary.   (c) Each subsidiary of Parent
(each, a "Parent Subsidiary") that constitutes a significant subsidiary of
Parent within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC to
Parent\'s business as a whole is so identified in Section 4.01(c) of the

(a) Except as required pursuant to any confidentiality agreement or
similar agreement or arrangement to which Parent or the Company or any of
their respective subsidiaries is a party or pursuant to applicable Law, from
the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,   (i) the Company
shall (and shall cause its subsidiaries  to): (A) provide to Parent (and
Parent\'s officers, directors,  employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, agents and other  representatives, collectively, "Representatives")
access at reasonable  times upon prior notice to the officers, employees,
agents,  properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and the 
Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof, including  access
to conduct any reasonable environmental assessment and (B)  furnish promptly
to Parent such information concerning the business,  properties, contracts,
assets, liabilities, personnel and other  aspects of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as Parent or its  Representatives may reasonably
request; and   (ii) Parent shall (and shall cause its subsidiaries to,  and

for the  purposes of this Section 6.03(a)(ii)(B), LNM and its Subsidiaries)
as  is reasonably necessary in order for the Company to perform a due 
diligence review with respect to the representations, warranties and 
covenants provided to the Company pursuant to this Agreement.   (b) All
information obtained by Parent or the Company pursuant to this Section 6.03
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the confidentiality agreement,
dated September 28, 2004 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between Parent
and the Company.   (c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.03
shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party
hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.   (d)
Each of the Parent and the Company hereby waives the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement as and to the extent necessary to permit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION
6.04 No Solicitation of Transactions. (a) The Company agrees that neither it
nor any Company Subsidiary nor any of the directors, officers or employees of
it or any Company Subsidiary will, and that it will not authorize or permit
its and the Company Subsidiaries\' agents, advisors and other representatives
(including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any Subsidiary), to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit
(including by way of furnishing nonpublic information), or take any other
action intended or reasonably likely to facilitate, any inquiries or
the making of any proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any
proposal or offer to its stockholders) that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Competing Transaction, or (ii) enter into or
maintain    39  or continue discussions or negotiations with any person
or entity in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a proposal or offer
for a Competing Transaction, or (iii) agree to, approve, endorse or recommend
any Competing Transaction or enter into any letter of intent or other
contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Competing Transaction, or (iv) authorize or permit any of the officers,
directors or employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or
any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, to
take any such action. The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within one (1) day after an executive officer
of the Company attains knowledge thereof), orally and promptly thereafter in
writing, if any proposal or offer, or any inquiry or contact with any person
with respect thereto, regarding a Competing Transaction is made, specifying
the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the party
making such proposal or offer or inquiry or contact. The Company shall
provide Parent with forty-eight (48) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior
notice as is provided to the members of the Company Board) of any meeting of
the Company Board at which the Company Board is expected to discuss
any Competing Transaction. The Company immediately shall cease and cause to
be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to a Competing Transaction. The Company
shall not release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party and the
Company also agrees to promptly request each person that has heretofore
executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of
acquiring (whether by merger, acquisition of stock or assets or otherwise)
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, if any, to return (or if permitted by
the applicable confidentiality agreement, destroy) all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such person by or on behalf of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and, if requested by Parent, to enforce
such person\'s obligation to do so.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 6.04, the Company Board may furnish or cause to be
furnished information to, and enter or cause to be entered into discussions
with, a person who has made an unsolicited, written proposal or offer
regarding a Competing Transaction, if the Company Board has (i) determined,
in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor),
that such proposal or offer constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) provided
written notice to Parent of its intent to furnish information to or enter
into discussions with such person at least three business days prior to
taking any such action and (iii) obtained from such person an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms determined by the Company in good faith
not to be substantially less favorable to the Company in the aggregate than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that
such confidentiality agreement and any related agreements shall not include
any provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such party or
having the effect of prohibiting the Company from satisfying its obligations
under this Agreement). The Company will use reasonable best efforts to keep
Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis of the status of any
negotiations it enters into with any Person regarding a Superior Proposal,
including any material amendments or proposed material amendments thereto.
The Company will provide Parent with all information regarding the Company
with which Parent has not previously been provided that is provided to any
person making a Superior Proposal.   (c) Except as permitted by this Section
6.04(c), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw
or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner    40  adverse
to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation (a "Change in the Company
Recommendation") or approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company to
enter into any letter of intent, agreement or obligation with respect to, any
Competing Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company Board
determines, in its good faith judgment prior to the time of the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting and after consultation with legal counsel (who may be
the Company\'s regularly engaged legal counsel), that it is required to make
a Change in the Company Recommendation to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to the Company and its stockholders under applicable
Law, the Company Board may (i) make a Change in the Company Recommendation or
(ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(j), but only, in the
case of this clause (ii), (A) after providing written notice to Parent (a
"Notice of Superior Proposal") advising Parent that the Company Board has
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior
Proposal and indicating that the Company Board intends to consider whether to
effect a Change in the Company Recommendation and (B) if Parent does not,
within three (3) business days of Parent\'s receipt of the Notice of Superior
Proposal, make an offer that the Company Board determines at meeting of the
Company Board held for such purpose, in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with a financial advisor) to be at least as favorable to the
Company\'s stockholders as such Superior Proposal. No disclosure that the
Company Board may determine in good faith (after consultation with counsel,
who may be the Company\'s regularly engaged counsel) that it or the Company
is required to make under applicable Law will constitute a violation of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Stockholders\' Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise
affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of
any Competing Transaction, or by any Change in the Company Recommendation.
The Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Competing
Transaction, or propose to do so, except as permitted herein.   (d) A
"Competing Transaction" means any of the following (other than the
Transactions): (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
transaction involving the Company or any Material Company Subsidiary; (ii)
any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including
a disposition of stock of one or more Company Subsidiaries) of 15% or more of
the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole;
(iii) any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any Material Company Subsidiary;
(iv) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in
any person beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities
of the Company; (v) any solicitation in opposition to adoption of this
Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders or (vi) any other transaction the
consummation of which would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay any of the Transactions.   (e) A "Superior Proposal" means an
unsolicited written proposal or offer made by a third party to consummate any
of the following transactions: (i) a merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination or other similar transaction involving the Company
pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such
transaction would hold less than 50% of the equity interest in the surviving
or resulting entity of such transaction or (ii) the acquisition by any person
or group (including by means of a tender offer or an exchange offer or   
41  a two-step transaction involving a tender offer followed with
reasonable promptness by a cash-out merger involving the Company), directly
or indirectly, of ownership of more than 50% of the then outstanding shares
of voting stock of the Company, in each case on pricing and other terms
(including conditions to consummation of the contemplated transaction) that
the Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment (after consultation
with a financial advisor), to be more favorable to the Company stockholders
than the Merger.   SECTION 6.05 Certain Post-Closing Matters. From and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms, all contracts,
agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
that are applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the
Company or any Subsidiary. In addition, if the Closing occurs, the parties
identified in Section 6.05 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule will take the
actions therein specified.   SECTION 6.06 Certain Employee Benefits and
Other Matters. (a) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will cause (i) a
member of the Company Board designated for such purpose prior to the Closing
by the Company Board, after consultation with Parent, or, if no such
individual is so designated, the Chairman of the Company Board, to be elected
to Parent\'s Board of Directors and (ii) the Company\'s CEO to be made the
chief executive officer for all Parent\'s United States operations; provided,
however, that if the Company\'s current CEO no longer holds that position at
the time of the closing, then Parent\'s obligations under this clause (ii)
will be solely to consult with the Company Board prior to the closing before
making any substitute appointment.   (b) On or prior to December 31, 2004,
the Company shall pay to each participant in the Company\'s Officer Cash and
Stock Bonus Plan and the Return on Equity Bonus Program the participant\'s
bonus for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2004.   SECTION 6.07
Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance. (a) The Certificate
of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set
forth in Article VIII and IX of the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior
to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or
agents of the Company, unless such modification shall be required by law.  
(b) After the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, including any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date of this Agreement, or whom becomes prior to the Effective
Time, a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of another person
(the "Indemnified Parties"), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based
in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining
to (i) the fact that such individual is or was a director, officer or
employee of the Company or    42  any of the Company Subsidiaries or (ii)
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will indemnify, defend and hold harmless, such Indemnified
Parties against such claims, actions or suits or proceedings, to the fullest
extent that would be permitted under the DGCL (including reimbursement for
reasonable fees and expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified
Party) (assuming for purposes of applying any applicable limitations on
indemnification under the DGCL that they were directors, officers or
employees of the Surviving Corporation at the time of the relevant action or
inaction). From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will
fulfill and honor in all material respects the obligations of the Company to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, the Indemnified Parties as provided in
the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect on the date
hereof, and any agreement specifically listed in Section 6.07 (b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule; provided, however, to the extent any such matter
arises out of service by any such individual as a director or officer of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary as of or after the Effective Time, such
indemnity shall be provided in accordance with the Deed of Incorporation and
Articles of Association of Parent, as in effect from time to time, and any
director and officer indemnification agreements between Parent and such
person.   (c) The Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time,
if available, the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies
maintained by the Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms
and conditions that are not materially less favorable) with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time[; provided, however, that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this
Section 6.07(c) more than an amount per year equal to 250% of current annual
premiums paid by the Company for such insurance which amount is set forth in
Section 6.07(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Maximum Premium").
If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained
at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent will maintain
policies of directors\' and officers\' insurance obtainable for an annual
premium equal to the Maximum Premium.   (d) In the event that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successor and assign of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall assume responsibility and liability for the obligations set
forth with respect to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, in this Section 6.07.   SECTION 6.08 Notification of Certain Matters.
The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event
the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which the notifying party determines
could reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect (b) any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may
be, to comply with or satisfy, in any material respect, any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.08 shall
not limit or    43  otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice. Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company of the occurrence of any material breach of the Richmond Agreement by
any party thereto.   SECTION 6.09 Company Affiliates. No later than 30 days
after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list
of names and addresses of those persons who were, in the Company\'s judgment,
on such date, affiliates (within the meaning of Rule 145 of the rules and
regulations promulgated under the Securities Act (each such person being a
"Company Affiliate")) of the Company. The Company shall provide Parent with
such information and documents as Parent shall reasonably request for
purposes of reviewing such list. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, prior to the Effective
Time, an affiliate letter in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 6.09,
executed by each of the Company Affiliates identified in the foregoing list
and any person who shall, in the Company\'s judgment, have become a Company
Affiliate subsequent to the delivery of such list.   SECTION 6.10 Further
Action; Reasonable Best Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall (a) make as soon as
reasonably practicable its respective filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions, under the HSR Act and the Foreign Merger Filings with
respect to the Transactions and (b) use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done,

limitation, using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all Permits,
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders
of Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the
Transactions and to fulfill the conditions to the Merger; provided that
neither Merger Sub nor Parent will be required by this Section 6.09 to take
any action, including entering into any consent decree, hold separate order
or other arrangement, that (x) (i) requires the divestiture of any assets of
any of Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries or (ii)
limits Parent\'s freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
any of Parent\'s or its affiliates\' assets or businesses, that, in any such
case, if such action were to be taken with respect to a comparable amount of
assets or businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, would have
a Company Material Adverse Effect; or (y) (i) requires the divestiture of any
assets of any of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (ii) limits
Parent\'s freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries or any of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries\' assets or businesses that, in any such case, would have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall give notice promptly to the
Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States pursuant
to the Exon-Florio Provision of the Transactions, and each of the parties
hereto shall make such additional filings and submissions as may
be reasonably advisable under the Exon-Florio Provision in respect of
the Transactions. In case, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the parties shall cause their respective proper officers and directors to use
their reasonable best efforts to take all such action.   SECTION 6.11
Reorganization. This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of section 1.368-2(g) of the income tax
regulations    44  promulgated under the Code. From and after the date of
this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not
knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any
action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act
could (i) prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, or (ii) cause the parties to fail to
comply with the requirements set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.367(a)-3(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and
agree that any decision by Parent whether to exercise any of the rights set
forth in Section 1.01(b) shall remain within the sole and absolute discretion
of Parent.   SECTION 6.12 Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take
all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.   SECTION 6.13 Consents of
Accountants. Parent and the Company will each use all reasonable efforts to
cause to be delivered to each other consents and comfort letters from their
respective independent auditors, in form reasonably satisfactory to the
recipient and customary in scope and substance for consents and comfort
letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements on Form F-4 under the Securities Act and the Euronext
Prospectus.   SECTION 6.14 NYSE Listing. Parent shall promptly prepare
and submit to the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") and Euronext a
listing application covering the Parent Class A Shares to be issued in the
Merger, and shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the
Effective Time, approval for the listing of such Parent Class A Shares,
subject to official notice of issuance to NYSE and will not voluntarily
withdraw such listings within three years of the Effective Date, and
Euronext, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent with respect to such
listing.   SECTION 6.15 Subsequent Financial Statements. The Company shall,
if it determines that doing so is practicable, prior to making
publicly available its financial results for any period after the date of
this Agreement and prior to filing any report or document with the SEC after
the date of this Agreement, furnish drafts of such document to Parent, it
being understood that Parent shall have no liability by reason of such
consultation.   SECTION 6.16 Public Announcements. The initial press
release relating to this Agreement shall be a joint press release the text of
which has been agreed to by each of Parent and the Company. Thereafter,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law or the requirements of the NYSE
or Euronext, each of Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions.   SECTION 6.17 Shareholder

this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare the

the Company as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation and clearing by Euronext of the Euronext Prospectus. Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Euronext Prospectus is
available following the clearing of the Euronext Prospectus by Euronext.  
(b) The Company shall have an opportunity to review in advance all written
submissions to or filings with Euronext, to participate in discussions with
Euronext in connection with drafts of the Euronext Prospectus and to comment
on the sections of such submissions or filings that include any disclosure
relating to the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries, and

shall consider in good faith and take into account any comments which the
Company may provide to Parent with respect to any drafts of the Euronext

include the recommendation of the Parent Board to the shareholders of Parent
in favor of approval of this Agreement and approval of the Transactions.  
(d) The Company represents and warrants that the information supplied by the

Section 3.04    SECTION 9.04 Severability. If any term or other provision
of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.    62   For the
avoidance of doubt, (1) the enforceability of the Company Shareholder Support
Agreement, the Parent Shareholder Support Agreement and the LNM Shareholder
Support Agreement (the "Support Agreements") will not affect any party\'s
obligations hereunder and these agreements are not to be deemed to be a part
of this Agreement and (2) the termination of this Agreement will not affect
parties relative rights and obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement
or, except as expressly provided herein or therein, the Support
Agreements.   SECTION 9.05 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and this Agreement
supersedes, except for the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent not waived
in Section 6.03(d), all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger,
by operation of law or otherwise), except that Merger Sub may assign all or
any of its rights and obligations hereunder to any affiliate of Parent
controlled by Parent; provided that such assignment does not adversely affect
the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the Code or the ability of Parent and the Company to receive the opinions
described in Sections 7.02(f) and 7.03(d); and provided further, that no such
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if
such assignee does not perform such obligations.   SECTION 9.06 Disclosure
Schedules; Disclosure Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the LNM Disclosure Information or in this Agreement, the information and
disclosures contained in any section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the
LNM Disclosure Information or the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in any other section of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule or the Company Disclosure Schedule, as applicable,
as though fully set forth in such other section for which the applicability
of such information and disclosure is readily apparent on the face of such
information or disclosure.   SECTION 9.07 Parties in Interest. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party
hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than Section 6.06
(which is intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and
may be enforced by such persons).   SECTION 9.08 Specific Performance. The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the
terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.   SECTION
9.09 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts
executed in and to be performed in that State (other than those provisions
set forth herein that are required to be governed by the DGCL). All actions
and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined exclusively in any New York state or federal court   
63  sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York. The parties
hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or
federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York for
the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement
brought by any party hereto and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to
assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim
that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be
enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.   SECTION 9.10 Waiver of
Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a trial by jury with
respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of the parties
hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would
not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and
(b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into
this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things,
the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.09.   SECTION 9.11
Headings. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included
for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.   SECTION 9.12 Counterparts. This
Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission)
in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.    [Signature Page to Follow]    64   IN WITNESS WHEREOF,

President and Chief Executive  Officer     EXHIBIT 6.09    FORM OF
AFFILIATE LETTER FOR  AFFILIATES OF THE COMPANY   [______] [__],
2004   Ispat International N.V. 15th Floor, Hofplein 20 3032 AC
Rotterdam The Netherlands   Ladies and Gentlemen:   I have been advised
that as of the date of this letter I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of
International Steel Group Inc., (the "Company"), as the term "affiliate" is
defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and
regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Act"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and
Reorganization, dated as of October 24, 2004 (the "Merger Agreement"), among
Ispat International N.V., a company organized under the laws of The
Netherlands ("Parent"), Park Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation
("Merger Sub"), and the Company, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company (the "Merger"). Capitalized terms used in this letter
agreement without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Merger Agreement.   As a result of the Merger, I may receive Parent Class
A Shares, par value $[_____] per share, of Parent (the "Parent Shares"). I
would receive such Parent Shares in exchange for shares (or upon exercise of
options for shares) owned by me of common stock, par value $[_____] per
share, of the Company (the "Company Shares").   I represent, warrant and
covenant to Parent that in the event I receive any Parent Shares as a result
of the Merger:   1. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition
of the Parent Shares in violation of the Act or the Rules and
Regulations.   A. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger 
Agreement and discussed the requirements of such documents and other 
applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise 
dispose of the Parent Shares, to the extent I felt necessary, with my 
counsel or counsel for the Company.   B. I have been advised that the
issuance of the Parent  Shares to me pursuant to the Merger has been
registered with the  Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on
Form F-4.  However, I have also been advised that, because at the time the
Merger  is submitted for a vote of the stockholders of the Company, (a) I
may  be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company and (b) the distribution 
by me of the Parent Shares has    not been registered under the Act, I may
not sell, transfer or  otherwise dispose of the Parent Shares issued to me in
the Merger  unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in 
conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145  promulgated by
the Commission under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer  or other disposition
has been registered under the Act or (iii) in the  opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to Parent, such sale,  transfer or other disposition is
otherwise exempt from registration  under the Act.   C. I understand that
Parent is under no obligation to  register the sale, transfer or other
disposition of the Parent Shares  by me or on my behalf under the Act or,
except as provided in  paragraph 2(A) below, to take any other action
necessary in order to  make compliance with an exemption from such
registration available.   D. I understand that there will be placed on the 
certificates for the Parent Shares issued to me, or any substitutions 
therefor, a legend stating in substance:   "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS
CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A  TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER
THE SECURITIES  ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS 
CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE  TERMS OF AN
AGREEMENT DATED [______], 2004 BETWEEN THE  REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND
ISPAT INTERNATIONAL N.V., A COPY  OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE
PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF  ISPAT INTERNATIONAL N.V."   E. I understand that
unless a sale or transfer by me of  the Parent Shares is made in conformity
with the provisions of Rule  145, or pursuant to a registration statement,
Parent reserves the  right to put the following legend on the certificates
issued to my  transferee:   "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE
HAVE NOT BEEN  REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE
ACQUIRED  FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO  WHICH
RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933  APPLIES. THE SHARES
HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH  A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN
CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION  THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND  MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED
EXCEPT IN  ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION  REQUIREMENTS
OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."   F. Execution of this letter should not be
considered an  admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of the Company
as  described in the first paragraph of this letter, nor as a waiver of  any
rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an  affiliate on or
after the date of this letter.     [2. By Parent\'s acceptance of this
letter, Parent hereby agrees with me as follows:   A. For so long as and to
the extent necessary to permit  me to sell the Parent Shares pursuant to Rule
145 and, to the extent  applicable, Rule 144 under the Act, Parent shall (a)
use its  reasonable efforts to (i) file, on a timely basis, all reports and 
data required to be filed with the Commission by it pursuant to  Section 13
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  "Exchange Act") and
(ii) furnish to me upon request a written  statement as to whether Parent has
complied with such reporting  requirements during the 12 months preceding any
proposed sale of the  Parent Shares by me under Rule 145 and (b) otherwise
use its  reasonable efforts to permit such sales pursuant to Rule 145 and
Rule  144. Parent hereby represents to me that it has filed all reports 
required to be filed with the Commission under Section 13 of the  Exchange
Act during the preceding 12 months.   B. It is understood and agreed that
certificates with  the legends set forth in paragraphs 1(E) and 1(F) above
will be  substituted by delivery of certificates without such legends if
(i)  one year shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the 
Parent Shares received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule  145(d)(2)
are then available to the undersigned, (ii) two years shall  have elapsed
from the date the undersigned acquired the Parent Shares  received in the
Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then  applicable to the
undersigned or (iii) Parent has received either an  opinion of counsel, which
opinion and counsel shall be reasonably  satisfactory to Parent, or a "no
action" letter obtained by the  undersigned from the staff of the Commission,
to the effect that the  restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the Act no
longer apply to the  undersigned.]   3. It is understood and agreed that
this letter agreement will terminate and be of no further force and effect if
the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.    Very
truly yours,    ---------------------------------------  Name:   Agreed
