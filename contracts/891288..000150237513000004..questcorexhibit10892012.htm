required by Sections 3.3(a), 3.3(b) or 3.3(c), as applicable. Any payment to

If the Vendors\' Representative objects in good faith to any item of an Earn-
Out Calculation Statement, the Vendors\' Representative must so advise the
Purchaser by delivering to the Purchaser a written notice (the "Earn-Out
Objection Notice") within 30 days after the Vendors\' Representative has
received the Earn-Out Calculation Statement, provided that the Purchaser has
complied with any request by the Vendors' Representative made pursuant to
Section 3.3(d), failing which, absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation
on the part of the Purchaser in connection with such Earn-Out Calculation
Statement, the Vendors' Representative shall lose its right to object to, and

Objection Notice must set out the reasons for the Vendors' Representative\'s
objection as well as the amount in dispute and reasonable details of the

Earn-Out Objection Notice by the Purchaser. Any issues in dispute not resolved
within such 30 day period will be referred as soon as possible thereafter by
the Vendors\' Representative and the Purchaser to the Independent Auditor. The
Independent Auditor will act as expert and not as arbitrator and will be
required to determine the issues in dispute that have been referred to it as
soon as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 30 days after
the date of referral of the dispute to it. In making its determination, the
Independent Auditor will only consider the issues in dispute placed before it.
The Vendors\' Representative and the Purchaser will provide or make available
all documents and information as are reasonably required by the Independent
Auditor to make its determination. The determination of the Independent
Auditor is final and binding on the Parties, and the Earn-Out Calculation
Statement will be (or not be) adjusted in accordance with such determination.
The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor in acting in accordance with
this Section 3.3(f) will be shared equally by the Purchaser and the Vendors,
unless the Independent Auditor determines otherwise. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

The Parties hereby agree that each Earn-Out Amount paid to the Vendors under
this Section 3.3 will be treated as a deferred portion of the Purchase Price.
The Parties agree to take this position on all Tax Returns and exercise their
respective good faith efforts to argue for this result; but nothing contained
in this Agreement is considered a guaranty or indemnity by any Party of this
or any tax treatment with respect to the Earn-Out Amount.

In no event will the total Earn-Out Amounts exceed, in the aggregate, $50
million. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

During the period covering the earn-out period contemplated by this Agreement:
(i) each of Questcor and the Purchaser agrees that it will operate in good
faith with respect to the Earn-Out Amounts and will not take and not cause the
Company to take any action with the intent to reduce the Earn-Out Amount
realizable by the Vendors; (ii) each of the Vendors agrees that, to the extent
they are a part of Company\'s management, they will not operate the Company
with the intent to maximize the Operating Earnings during the earn-out period
contemplated by this Agreement in any manner that would be inconsistent with
their fiduciary obligation to act in the best interest of the Company; (iii)
Questcor and the Purchaser shall make good faith efforts to allow the Company
to operate as a free-standing business consistent with the manner set out in
the governance and management relationship letter between the Company and
Questcor, dated as of the Closing (the "Governance Document"); and (iv)
Questcor shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to) enter into any
agreements or arrangements with the Company following the Closing Date
providing for the Company to sell or supply the Questcor or its Affiliates
with services or products at less than fair commercial rates. Furthermore, it
is the intent of the parties that the Earn-Out Amounts will be based solely on
the operations of the Company as it exists today and not include any
operations of Company that are subsequently acquired from third parties,
whether by merger, amalgamation or consolidation or acquisition, unless
Questcor and the Vendors' Representative mutually agree otherwise. Any
disputes shall be resolved in accordance with sub-section (m) of this Section
3.3. 

| 
---|--- 

(j)

|

In the event Questcor (or any of its subsidiaries), in its sole discretion and
without the approval by the Vendors' Representative materially changes,
proposes to materially change, or causes a material change to, the executive
management, the business, accounting policies or methods, or operations (other
than changes necessary in maintaining compliance, or bringing the Company into
compliance, with applicable Law) of the Company from those in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date (any such material change or proposed
material change, a "Change"), Questcor shall notify Vendors' Representative in
writing and if Vendors\' Representative reasonably believes that any such
Change is likely to decrease the amount of the Earn-Out Amount that the
Vendors would have earned absent such Change, Vendors\' Representative may
give written notice (the "Change Notice") to Questcor of such belief. In such
event, Vendors\' Representative and Questcor's Chief Financial Officer shall
meet within thirty (30) days following the receipt by Questcor of such Change
Notice to discuss in good faith (which discussions may be with or without
prejudice at the election of Parties): (i) whether the Change was in
accordance with the principles as set out in the Governance Document, (ii)
whether the Change is likely to decrease the amount of the Earn-Out Amount
paid to Vendors and (iii) whether any adjustments to the calculations used to
determine the Earn-Out Amount are necessary in order to restore the Vendors\'
ability to earn a comparable Earn-Out Amount that would have been earned by
the Vendors absent such Change. If the Purchaser and Vendors\' Representative
disagree if or to the extent any adjustments are necessary, or the nature of
such adjustments, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with sub-section
(m) of this Section 3.3. 

| 
---|--- 

(k)

|

In the event Questcor believes the management of the Company operated the
Company with the intent to maximize the Operating Earnings during the earn-out
period contemplated by this Agreement but failed to act in the best interest
of the Company, Questcor shall notify Vendors\' Representative in writing and
Vendors\' Representative and Questcor's Chief Financial Officer shall meet to
discuss in good faith (which discussions may be with or without prejudice at
the election of Parties): whether (i) management of the Company operated the
Company with the intent to maximize the Operating Earnings during the earn-out
period contemplated by this Agreement but failed to act in the best interest
of the Company, (ii) the failure is likely to increase the amount of the Earn-
Out Amount paid to Vendors and (iii) any adjustments to the calculations used
to determine the Earn-Out Amounts are necessary in order to reduce the Earn-
Out Amount to an amount that would have been earned by Vendors absent such
failure. If the parties disagree if or to the extent any adjustments are
necessary, or the nature of such adjustments, the dispute shall be resolved in
accordance with sub-section (m) of this Section 3.3. 

| 
---|--- 

(l)

|

Until the 2015 Earn-Out Amount, if any, has been paid, the Purchaser shall not
amalgamate with the Company and no Change of Control shall occur without the
consent of the Vendors' Representative, acting on behalf of the Vendors, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

| 
---|--- 

(m)

|

In the event of any controversy or dispute between the Parties hereto arising
out of or relating to sub-sections (j) or (k) of this Section 3.3, if no
resolution is reached within 30 days following the date on which one Party
first notifies the other of his or its request that such a meeting be held,
then, and in that event, the controversy or dispute shall be referred to and
determined by final and binding arbitration before a single arbitrator
pursuant to the International Commercial Arbitration Act, R.S.O. 1990
(Ontario) and the procedures set out in Schedule 3.3(m) to this Agreement. The
seat of the arbitration shall be Ontario and the hearing shall be conducted in

Within 30 days of Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company to change its
fiscal year end to December 31 and shall ensure that the Company's fiscal year
remains December 31 until at least January 1, 2016, unless the consent of the

which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

3.4

Purchase Price Adjustments 

Notwithstanding anything else in the Agreement the Purchase Price is reduced
by (i) the amount of any third party funding that the Company may be required
to re-pay due to the failure to obtain the consent or consents relating to the
agreements referenced in paragraph 1 of Section 4.8 of the Disclosure letter,
which amount, if any, shall be held back by Purchaser pending the Vendors
obtaining such consent or consents prior to the Company being required to make
(and actually making) such repayment, and (ii) the amount of any indemnity
claims paid to the Purchaser pursuant to Article 11.

amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of any Tax Law. To the extent that

or relating to: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

any non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the

| 
---|---

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

limitations: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Amounts, excluding any such Claims based on fraud or wilful misconduct of the
Purchaser. 

| 
---|--- 

11.3

|

Indemnification Procedures for Third Party Claims 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

In the case of Claims made by a third party with respect to which
indemnification is sought, the party entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement (the "Indemnified Party") will give prompt notice, and in any event
within 10 days, to the other party (the "Indemnifying Party"), which in the
case of notice to the Vendors shall be to the Vendors\' Representative, of any
such Claims made upon it. If the Indemnified Party fails to give such notice,
such failure does not preclude the Indemnified Party from obtaining such
indemnification, but its right to indemnification may be reduced to the extent
that such delay prejudiced the defence of the Claim or increased the amount of
liability or cost of defense. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The Indemnifying Party may, by notice to the Indemnified Party given not later
than 30 days after receipt of the notice described in Section 11.3(a), assume
the control of the defence, compromise or settlement of the Claim, but only if
such assumption is, by its terms, without cost to the Indemnified Party and if
the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing the obligation of the
Indemnifying Party to indemnify the Indemnified Party in accordance with the
terms contained in this Section in respect of that Claim. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Vendors\' Representative shall not have the
right to assume the control of any defence, compromise, or settlement of any
Claim if: 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

the Purchaser determines in good faith that the Claim could have a Material
Adverse Effect; or 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

the Claim involves Acthar or any proprietary products of Questcor or its
Affiliates in any respect. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Upon the assumption of control of any Claim by the Indemnifying Party as set
out in Section 11.3(b), the Indemnifying Party will diligently proceed with
the defence, compromise or settlement of the Claim at its sole expense,
including if necessary, employment of counsel and experts reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and, in connection therewith, the
Indemnified Party will cooperate fully, but at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party with respect to any out-of-pocket expenses incurred, to make available
to the Indemnifying Party all pertinent information and witnesses under the
Indemnified Party's control, make such assignments and take such other steps
as in the opinion of counsel for the Indemnifying Party are reasonably
necessary to enable the Indemnifying Party to conduct such defence. The
Indemnified Party will also have the right to participate in the negotiation,
settlement or defence of any Claim at its own expense. The Indemnifying Party
will not settle any Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

The final determination of any Claim pursuant to this Section, including all
related costs and expenses, is binding and conclusive upon all of the Parties
as to the validity or invalidity, as the case may be, of such Claim against
the Indemnifying Party. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of a Claim, the Indemnified
Party may make such settlement of the Claim as it determines, acting
reasonably and in good faith, and such settlement or any other final
determination of the Claim is binding upon the Indemnifying Party. 

| 
---|--- 

11.4

|

Remedies 

The rights of indemnity in Section 11.1 and 11.2 are not prejudiced by the
exercise of a termination right contained in Article 10. The Purchaser,
Questcor, the Vendors and the Company acknowledge that the failure to comply
with a covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement may give rise to
irreparable injury to the other Parties inadequately compensable in damages.
Accordingly, in addition to seeking indemnification under Section 11.1 and any
other remedies otherwise available at Law, the Parties may also seek to
enforce the performance of this Agreement by injunction or specific
performance upon application to a court of competent jurisdiction without
proof of actual damage (and without requirement of posting a bond or other
security). This Article 11 remains in full force and effect in all
circumstances and is not terminated by any breach (fundamental, negligent or
otherwise) by any Party of its representations, warranties or covenants under
this Agreement or under any Closing document or by any termination or
rescission of this Agreement by any Party.

| 
---|--- 

11.5

|

Limitation on Liability 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

The amount of any damages which may be claimed by the Purchaser or Questcor or
any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to a Claim made under this Agreement
or any agreement, certificate or other document given to carry out the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be calculated to be the cost or loss to
the Purchaser or Questcor or any Purchaser Indemnified Party after giving
effect to: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

any insurance proceeds actually received by the Company from the Company's
insurance policies (and for greater certainty, not taking into account any
insurance policies of the Purchaser or Questcor) in relation to the matter
which is the subject of the Claim; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

the net present value of any related, determinable tax benefits realized, or
which will (with reasonable certainty) be realized within a five year period
following the date of incurring such cost or loss, by the Company or the
Purchaser or Questcor or any Purchaser Indemnified Party in relation to the
matter which is the subject of the Claim; 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

the amount of any reduction in the Earn-Out Amounts that would otherwise have
been payable to the Vendors but for the Purchaser's or Questcor's or any
Purchaser Indemnified Party's Claim hereunder arising from a cost or loss by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

with respect to any Claim under Section 11.1(a)(vi), the greater of (i) the
net present value of net cash flow expected with reasonable certainty to be
derived from the Facility for alternative uses that would not otherwise be
available but for the breach of the Construction Agreements and (ii) the
salvage value of the Facility. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or of any agreement,
certificate or other document made in order to carry out the transactions
contemplated hereby, the aggregate collective liability of the Vendors to the
Purchaser or Questcor or any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Agreement or of any agreement, certificate or other document provided by or on
behalf of the Vendors pursuant to this Agreement, including the obligations of
the Vendors to indemnify the Purchaser or Questcor or any Purchaser
Indemnified Party as set forth in this Article 11, is limited to the amount of
$25,000,000 plus 50% of the Earn-Out Amounts except as follows: 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

any such Claims based on fraud or willful misconduct of the Vendors; 

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

the aggregate liability of each Vendor is limited to the proportionate amount
of the Purchase Price received by such Vendor, but such limit does not
otherwise detract from the joint and several obligations of the Vendors under
Section 11.1. 

| 
---|--- 

11.6

|

Trustee and Agent 

The Vendors and the Company acknowledge that the Purchaser is acting as
trustee and agent for the remaining Purchaser Indemnified Parties, on whose
behalf and for whose benefit the indemnity in Section 11.1, is provided and
that such remaining Indemnified Parties have the full right and entitlement to
take the benefit of and enforce such indemnity notwithstanding that they may
not individually be parties to this Agreement. The Vendors agree that the
Purchaser may enforce the indemnity for and on behalf of such remaining
Purchaser Indemnified Parties and, in such event, the Vendors will not in any
proceeding to enforce the indemnity by or on behalf of such remaining
Purchaser Indemnified Parties assert any defence thereto based on the absence
of authority or consideration or privity of contract and irrevocably waives
the benefit of any such defence.

| 
---|--- 

11.7

|

Release 

Effective as of the Closing, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement, including the consideration to be
received by the Vendors:

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

Each Vendor hereby irrevocably releases and forever discharges the Company and
the Subsidiaries and their respective divisions, predecessors, directors,
officers, members, managers, partners (general or limited), agents, and
employees and the successors, heirs, assigns, executors and administrators to
the foregoing (the "Released Parties") of and from any and all manner or
causes of actions, Claims, suits, rights, debs, sums of money, covenants,
Contracts, damages and judgments, whatsoever, in Law or equity, which such
Vendor ever had, now has, or which he hereafter can, shall or may have,
against the Released Parties, whether known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, matured or unmatured, fixed or contingent, for, upon reason of
any matter relating to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, and arising at
any time on or prior to the Closing Date, whether in such Vendor\'s capacity
as an equity holder, director, officer, holder of indebtedness or otherwise,
and the Released Parties shall not have liability with respect thereto;
provided, however, that such release shall not cover Claims or liabilities for
amounts owed pursuant to, or other rights set forth in, or other Claims
arising in connection with this Agreement or any agreement ancillary to this
Agreement, nor shall such release cover: (i) Claims or liabilities for amounts
owed to any Vendor at the Closing and payable to such Vendor after the Closing
in respect of accrued salary and benefits payable by the Company in the
ordinary course of the Company's business; or (ii) subject to Section 11.7(c),
any right to indemnification under the by-laws of the Company. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

Each Vendor acknowledges and agrees that the release set forth in this Section
11.7 applies to all Claims or liabilities of any nature whatsoever, whether at
Law or in equity, whether known or unknown, fixed or contingent, suspected or
unsuspected, foreseen or unforeseen that it may have against the Company with
respect to the matters being released hereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

(h)

|

Questcor, the Purchaser and the Company agree that the indemnification
provisions in favour of the Company's directors and officers currently set out
in the by-laws of the Company shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect any director or officer to whom this section
applies for a period of six years following the Closing. However, each of the
Vendors hereby waives any rights to indemnification under the Company by-laws
in respect of any Claim that Questcor or the Purchaser have against such
Vendor under this Agreement, in respect of which a Vendor has a right to
indemnification under the Company's by-laws, but without prejudice to the
Vendors' right to indemnification under the Company by-laws on any other
matter in the future.

| 
---|--- 

12.1

|

Public Notices, Press Releases and Announcements 

None of the Parties shall issue any press release or make any public
announcement or other disclosure relating to the existence or subject matter

disclosure with respect thereto, it shall, at a reasonable time before making
any public disclosure, consult with the other Parties regarding such
disclosure, seek such confidential treatment for such terms or portions of
