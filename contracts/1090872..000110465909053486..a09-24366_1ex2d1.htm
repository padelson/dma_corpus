#### 

  

#### (iv) _Cancellation of Company Options with an Exercise Price equal to or
in excess of the Cash Amount Per Share_.  Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, each Company Option (whether vested
or unvested) with an exercise price equal to or in excess of the Cash Amount
Per Share, in each case that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any
further action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment therefor and in full

#### (v) _Company Director Stock Units_.  Subject to the terms and conditions

Director Stock Unit outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be converted
automatically into the vested right to receive an amount in cash equal to the

number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Director Stock Unit
Award.

2.1(b)_, each share of Company Capital Stock held by the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.

### (d) _Adjustments_.  In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to the
Company Capital Stock occurring after the Agreement Date and prior to the
Effective Time, all references in this Agreement to specified numbers of
shares of any class or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided
for that are based upon numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading
prices therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent
necessary to provide the parties the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or
other like change.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Payment to Holders of Company Options, Company Director Stock Units
and Company Stock-Based Awards_.  Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay the amounts payable pursuant to _Sections 2.1(b)(ii),
(iii) and (v)_, subject to such deductions and withholding as may be required
pursuant to the provisions of _Sections 2.1 and 2.3(b)_, and except to the
extent required by Applicable Laws, (A) in exchange for Company Options with
an exercise price less than

  



        
   

  

###

to the holders thereof through the Surviving Corporations payroll process as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time, and (B) in exchange for

### 

  

### (f) _Setoff_. If, as of the Effective Time, there is any outstanding
indebtedness of any holder of Company Capital Stock owed to the Company with
respect to the purchase by such holder of such Company Capital Stock from the
Company, the total amount of such indebtedness (including principal, accrued
interest and any other amounts owed to the Company with respect to such
purchase) shall be deducted by Parent from the aggregate amount otherwise
payable in the Merger to such Company Stockholder for his, her or its Company
Securities pursuant to this _Section 2.1_.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Dissenting Shares_.  Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Amount Per Share, and the holders thereof shall
be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the Delaware
Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if any such Company Stockholder shall
fail to perfect or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such
stockholders rights under Section 262 of the Delaware Law, such
stockholders shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such
stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive fair value under Section
262 of the Delaware Law shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at
the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Cash Amount Per Share. From
and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of an equity
owner of the Surviving Corporation or of a stockholder of Acquiror.

  

###

Subject to the exceptions set forth in a numbered or lettered section of the
disclosure letter of the Company addressed to Acquiror, dated as of the
Agreement Date and delivered to Acquiror concurrently with the parties
execution of this Agreement (the " **Company Disclosure Letter**
") referencing a representation or warranty (or covenant, as applicable)
herein (each of which exceptions, in order to be effective, shall indicate
the section and, if applicable, the subsection of this Agreement to which it
relates (unless and to the extent the applicability to other representations
and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent from the
actual text of the disclosed exception), , the Company represents and
warrants to Acquiror as follows:

  



  

## 3.1 _Organization and Good Standing_.  The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own,
operate and lease its properties and to carry on the Company Business. The
Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing
(to the

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## extent that such concept is applicable), in each jurisdiction where
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate with any such other failures, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.  The Company has delivered
or made available to Acquiror or its counsel true and complete copies of the
Company Charter Documents. The Company is not in violation of the Company
Charter Documents.

  

## 

  

## 3.2 _Company Subsidiaries_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Organization and Good Standing_. _Schedule 3.2(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all Company
Subsidiaries.  Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
(i) each Company Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing (to the extent that such concept is applicable) under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) each Company Subsidiary
has the corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its
properties and to carry on its business, (iii) each Company Subsidiary is
duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, and (iv) each Company Subsidiary is not in violation of its
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or other comparable charter
documents), each as amended to date.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Ownership_. The Company is the owner of all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of each Company Subsidiary and all such
shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
 All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each Company
Subsidiary are owned by the Company free and clear of all Encumbrances (other
than Permitted Encumbrances) and are not subject to any preemptive right or
right of first refusal created by statute, the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws (or other comparable charter documents), as
applicable, of such Company Subsidiary or any agreement to which such Company
Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound. There are no stock
appreciation rights, options, warrants, calls, rights, legally
binding commitments, conversion privileges or preemptive or other rights or
agreements outstanding to purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of capital
stock of a Company Subsidiary or any securities or debt convertible into or
exchangeable for capital stock of a Company Subsidiary or obligating the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any such
option, warrant, call, right, legally binding commitment, conversion
privilege or preemptive or other right or agreement. Other than the Company
Subsidiaries set forth in _Schedule 3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company does not have any Company Subsidiary or any equity or
ownership interest (or any interest convertible or exchangeable
or exercisable for, any equity or ownership interest), whether direct or
indirect, in any Person. The Company is not contractually obligated to make
nor is it contractually bound by any agreement or obligation to make any
investment in or capital contribution in or on behalf of any other Person.

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## 3.3 _Power, Authorization and Validity_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Power and Authority_.  The Company has all requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under this Agreement and, subject to adoption of this Agreement by holders of
a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "
**Company Stockholder Approval** "), to consummate the Merger and
other transactions contemplated hereby. The Company Board, by resolutions
duly adopted (and not thereafter modified or rescinded) by the unanimous vote
of the full Company Board, has (i) determined that this Agreement and the
terms and conditions of the Merger and this Agreement are fair to, advisable
and in the best interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders, (ii)
approved and adopted this Agreement and the Merger, and (iii) directed that
the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to the Company Stockholders for
consideration and recommended that all of the Company Stockholders adopt this
Agreement. The Company Stockholder Approval is the only vote of the holders
of any class or series of Company Capital Stock necessary to adopt this
Agreement and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby under the Company Charter Documents and Applicable Law. The Company
and the Company Subsidiaries are not party to any "stockholder rights plan"
or similar anti-takeover agreement or plan that is currently in effect.

  

### 

  

### (b) _No Consents_.  No consent, approval, order, authorization, release
or waiver of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is necessary or required to be made or obtained by the Company to
enable the Company to lawfully execute and deliver, enter into, and perform
its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Merger, except for
(i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of
State and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states
in which Company is qualified to do business, (ii) the Company
Stockholder Approval, (iii) such filings and notifications as may be required
to be made by the Company in connection with the Merger under the HSR Act and
other applicable Antitrust Laws (as defined in _Section 5.6(a)_) and
the expiration or early termination of applicable waiting periods under the
HSR Act and such Antitrust Laws, (iv) the filing with the SEC of the
Proxy Statement and such reports and filings under the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder as may be required in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (v) such other filings
and notifications as may be required to be made by the Company under federal,
state or foreign securities laws or the rules and regulations of NASDAQ, and
(vi) such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, releases,
waivers, registrations, declarations or filings that if not made or obtained
(A) would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or (B) would not be
material to the Companys ability to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Enforceability_.  This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company, and assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Acquiror and Merger Sub, constitutes the valid
and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of (i) applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now
or hereafter in effect relating to

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### rights of creditors generally and (ii) rules of law and equity governing
specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Takeover Laws_.  Assuming the truth of the representations and
warranties contained in _Section 4.5_, the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby by the
Company Board referred to in _Section 3.3(a)_ constitute all of the
approvals that are necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the
Merger, and the transactions contemplated hereby the provisions of Section
203 of Delaware Law and represent the only actions necessary to ensure that
Section 203 of Delaware Law does not and will not apply to the execution,
delivery, or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger
or other transactions contemplated hereby. No other state takeover or other
similar statute or regulation is applicable to this Agreement or the Merger.

with Applicable Law except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company and all requirements set forth in the Company Option Plan and
the Contracts entered into thereunder in connection with the grant or
issuance of such Company Options, Company Stock-Based Awards and Company
Director Stock Units. Neither the Company Option Plan, nor the standard form
agreements under the Company Option Plan, have been amended, modified or

SEC, and there are no agreements, understandings or commitments to amend,
modify or supplement such plans or agreements.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Company Debt_.  No bonds, debentures, notes or other Debt of the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries (i) having the right to vote on any
matters on which stockholders may vote (or which is convertible into, or

(collectively, " **Company Voting Debt** "), is issued or outstanding as of
the Agreement Date. _Schedule 3.4(c)_ to the Company Disclosure Letter

Subsidiaries as of the Agreement Date. All Debt may be prepaid at the Closing
without penalty under the terms of the agreements governing such Debt.

  

### 

  

### (d) _No Other Rights_.  The Company Charter Documents do not provide, and

## 3.5 _No Conflict_.  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company, nor the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby: (a) conflicts with, or (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both) results in a termination, breach or violation of, or
constitutes a default under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation or modification,
impairment or loss of any benefit under, or require

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## any consent, approval or waiver from any Person pursuant to (i)
any provision of the Company Charter Documents or other comparable
charter documents of any Company Subsidiary, each as currently in effect,

of) the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any Third Party Intellectual
Property which is in any manner incorporated in any Company Product, or would
be infringed by the manufacture, sale, offering for sale, use, importation or
distribution of any Company Product in the absence of such Contract, or any
Contract pursuant to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary grants any
right or license to another Person under any material Company IP Right
(except in the cases of subclause (ii) and (iii), where such
conflicts, terminations, breaches, violations or defaults, rights of
termination or cancellation, acceleration or modification, impairment, loss,
or failures to obtain such consents, approvals or waivers, would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company); or (b) will result in the creation of any
Encumbrance on any of the properties or assets of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries that would be material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  

## 

  

## 3.6 _SEC Filings_.

statements, prospectuses, reports, forms, statements, schedules,
certifications and other documents (including exhibits and all other items
incorporated by reference) required to be filed or furnished by the Company
under Applicable Law since September 29, 2006 (all such required registration
statements, prospectuses, reports, forms, statements, schedules,
certifications and other documents, including those that the Company may file
subsequent to the Agreement Date and through the Effective Time, are referred
to herein as the " **Company SEC Documents** "), and all such Company SEC
Documents in the form filed with the SEC are available on the SECs EDGAR
website. As of their respective filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by
a filing prior to the Agreement Date, then on the date of such filing), the
Company SEC Documents (i) were prepared in accordance and complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder
applicable to such Company SEC Documents and (ii) did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  None
of the Company Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other
documents with the SEC.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Financial Statements_.  Each of the consolidated financial
statements (including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in
the Company SEC Documents (the " **Company Financial Statements** "),
including each Company SEC Document filed after the Agreement Date until the
Closing, (i) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC,
as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements
and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii)
was prepared in accordance with GAAP (except in the case of unaudited interim
financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q or

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### Form 8-K) applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and (iii) fairly presented
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and
the consolidated results of Companys and the Company Subsidiaries
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated (except that the
unaudited interim financial statements were subject to normal and recurring
year-end and quarter-end adjustments). Except as reflected in the Company
Balance Sheet (or described in the notes thereto), neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries has any Liabilities of any nature that would
be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, or described in the notes
thereto, except (i) Liabilities incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, (ii)
Liabilities reserved against in the Company Balance Sheet (but only to the
extent of such reserves), (iii) Liabilities for Transaction Expenses, and
(iv) Liabilities that would not reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Sarbanes Act_.  The Company is in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes Act, and the related
rules and regulations promulgated under such act or the Exchange Act, in each
case, as currently in effect. Since September 29, 2006, to the knowledge of
the Company, no party has submitted any complaint to the Audit Committee of
the Company Board pursuant to the procedures established in accordance with
Section 10A(m)(4) of the Exchange Act. To the Companys knowledge, there are
no material violations of the Companys code of conduct, adopted pursuant
to NASDAQ Rule 4350(n). No attorney representing the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries has reported any material violation to the Companys
chief legal officer, chief executive officer, or any committee of the Company
Board, including any qualified legal compliance committee, as contemplated by
the rules set forth in 17 CFR Part 205.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Controls_. The Company has established and maintains a system of
internal accounting controls reasonably sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that (i) receipts and expenditures of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and the Company Board, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries. The amount recorded for assets on the books and
records of the Company is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to differences. To the
Companys knowledge, there are no "significant deficiencies" or "material
weaknesses" (each as defined by Rule 1-02(a)(4) of Regulation S-X promulgated
by the SEC) in the design or operation of the Companys internal controls and
procedures which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data. To the Companys knowledge, there is no fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other current or former employees of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries who have a role in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting. The Company has
established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in
Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that

  



         
 

  

### 

  

### it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
"principal executive officer" and the "principal financial officer" of the
Company required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes Act with respect to such

Representatives that is contained in the Proxy Statement.

  

## 

  

## 4.8 _Litigation_. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of Acquiror, threatened against Acquiror or Merger Sub, in either
case that would, individually or in the aggregate, be material to Acquirors

contemplated by this Agreement or to perform their respective obligations
under this Agreement. Neither Acquiror nor Merger Sub is subject to any
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Authority

During the time period from the Agreement Date until the earlier to occur of
(a) the Effective Time or (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with the provisions of _Article 9_, the Company covenants and agrees with
Acquiror as follows:

  



  

## 5.1 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Company Stockholders  Meeting_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Proxy Statement_.  As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Agreement Date (but in any event within ten Business Days), the Company shall
prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, the Proxy Statement.  The
Company shall provide Acquiror a reasonable advance opportunity to review and
comment upon, and shall consider in good faith the views of Acquiror with
respect to, the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and
no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made
by the Company without Acquirors prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld). The Company will promptly advise Acquiror of the time
when the definitive form of the Proxy Statement has been filed with the SEC
or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop
order, or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy
Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC
for additional information and will promptly provide Acquiror with copies of
any written communication from the SEC or any state securities commission.
The Company will respond in good faith to any comments of the SEC and will
provide Acquiror the opportunity to review and comment on any response
prepared by the Company to any comments of the SEC prior to the submission
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change of
Recommendation effected by the Company Board in accordance with _Section
5.2_, the Company shall not be obligated to consider in good faith or include
any comments from Acquiror on any disclosures made by the Company in any
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement with respect to such Change
of Recommendation or the circumstances related to such Change of
Recommendation. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
the Company Stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within two Business Days) after the filing of the definitive Proxy Statement
with the SEC. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or
information relating to the Company, or any of its Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by, or notified to, the Company which should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that
such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, the Company shall promptly notify Acquiror and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law, disseminated to
the Company Stockholders.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Company Stockholders  Meeting_.  The Company shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date, take all action
necessary in accordance with the Company Charter Documents, Applicable Law
and the rules of NASDAQ to establish a record date for, duly give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting. Subject to _Section
5.2(d)_ and  _Section 5.2(e)_, the Company will use reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Company Stockholder

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### Approval, including by using reasonable best efforts to solicit from the
Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, and
will take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company
Stockholders in advance of a vote on the adoption of this Agreement if, as of
the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled,
there are either insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of such meeting or the Company is required to postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting by Applicable Law, order or a
specific request from the SEC provided that the Company shall give Acquiror
reasonable advance notice of any meetings or phone calls with the SEC to
discuss any possible postponement or adjournment of the Company
Stockholders Meeting and shall give Acquiror or its counsel an opportunity
to participate in such meeting or telephone call. The Company shall ensure
that the Company Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and
conducted, and that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company
Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with the Company Charter
Documents, Applicable Law and the rules of NASDAQ. Without the prior written
consent of Acquiror, adoption of this Agreement (including adjournment of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, if necessary, if a quorum is present, to
solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes in favor of
adoption of this Agreement), is the only matter which the Company shall
propose to be acted on by the Company Stockholders at the Company
Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms, (i) adoption of this Agreement shall be submitted by the Company to
the Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and (ii)
subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 5.1_, the
Companys obligations under this _Section 5.1_ shall not be
terminated, superseded, limited or otherwise affected by the announcement or
receipt of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or Superior Offer or by any
Change of Recommendation.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Board Recommendation_.  Unless the Company Board shall have effected
a Change of Recommendation pursuant to, and in compliance with, _Section
5.2_, (i) the Company Board shall unanimously recommend that the Company
Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company
Stockholders Meeting, (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to
the effect that the Company Board has unanimously recommended that the
Company Stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the
Company Stockholders Meeting, and (iii) neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or resolve to,
or publicly propose to, withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to
Acquiror, the recommendation of the Company Board that the Company
Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

Recommendation;

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) Acquiror shall not have, within the aforementioned five Business
Day period, made a written, binding and irrevocable (through the expiration
of such five Business Day period) offer to modify the terms and conditions of

thereof, and that no position has been taken by the Company Board as to the
advisability or desirability of such Alternative Transaction Proposal, shall

Indemnified Persons** ") pursuant to any indemnification provisions under the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or other similar organizational
documents) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as in effect on the
Agreement Date and pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the

## 

  

## 10.4 _Entire Agreement_.  This Agreement and the documents and instruments
and other agreements among the parties hereto that contemplate, are
contemplated by or are referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure
Letter, together with the exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto,
constitutes the entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements or
understandings, express or implied, written or oral, between the parties with
respect hereto other than the Confidentiality Agreement. The express terms

inconsistent with any of the terms hereof.

  

## 

  

## 10.5 _Third Party Beneficiary Rights_.  No provisions of this Agreement
(including but not limited to the provisions of _Section 6.4_) are intended,

rights or any other rights of any kind in any client, customer, employee,
affiliate, stockholder, partner or any party hereto or any other Person
unless specifically provided otherwise herein and, except as so provided, all
provisions hereof shall be personal solely between the parties to this
Agreement; except (a) that _Section 6.5_ is intended to benefit the Company
Indemnified Persons, and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of
holders of shares of the Company Common Stock and other Company securities to

the economic, business and other purposes of the void or unenforceable
provision.

  

## 

  

## 10.8 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and

not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.  Accordingly, the parties
hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Acquiror and Merger
Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations
set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and Acquiror and

breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
the other under this Agreement.
