title and interest as of the Closing in and to the Purchased Assets (other
than the Purchased Entity Shares) and the assumption by Purchaser of the
Assumed Liabilities in accordance with and subject to this Agreement, by and
between the applicable Seller Entities and Purchaser, in customary form (the "
_Assignment Agreement and Bill of Sale_ "), duly executed by Purchaser, to
the extent applicable; and

  



  

(v)  any other instruments necessary and appropriate to evidence

Section 2.9   _Adjustment to Base Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a)   _Section 2.9_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets
forth a calculation of the Working Capital, the Cash Amounts and the Funded
Debt of the Business, in each case, as of June 30, 2019 (the " _Sample Closing
Statement_ "), including the asset and liability line items included in the
calculation of Working Capital, prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied
on a basis consistent with the accounting principles, practices, procedures,
methodologies and policies that were employed in preparing the Business
Financial Information (with consistent classifications, judgments, inclusions,
exclusions and valuation and estimation methodologies), as modified by the
accounting principles set forth on _Section 2.9_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules (collectively, the " _Transaction Accounting Principles_ ").

  



  

(b)  At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Purchaser a closing
statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Seller's good-faith
estimate of (i) the Adjustment Amount (such estimate, the " _Estimated
Adjustment Amount_ "), (ii) the Closing Cash Amounts (such estimate, the "
_Estimated Closing Cash Amounts_ ") and (iii) the Closing Funded Debt (such
estimate, the " _Estimated Closing Funded Debt_ "). The Closing Statement
shall set forth the calculations of such amounts in a manner consistent with
the Sample Closing Statement and be prepared in accordance with the
Transaction Accounting Principles, including the use of the same line items
and line item entries set forth on and used in the preparation of the Sample
Closing Statement. The Estimated Adjustment Amount, the Estimated Closing
Cash Amounts and the Estimated Closing Funded Debt shall be used to calculate
the Closing Purchase Price to be paid by Purchaser to Seller at the Closing.
Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the Post-
Closing Statement becomes final and binding in accordance with this _Section
2.9_, it will not take any actions with respect to any accounting books,
records, policies or procedures on which the Sample Closing Statement or the
Closing Statement is based, or on which the Post-Closing Statement is to be
based, that are inconsistent with the ordinary course past practice of the
Business (or of Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Business)
prior to the Closing that would impede or materially delay the final
determination of the Post-Closing Statement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, neither Party shall reflect any changes (including any
changes reflected in the Post-Closing Statement) in any reserve or other
account existing as of the date of the most recent balance sheet included in
the Business Financial Information or other amount reflected in such balance
sheet, except as a result of events occurring after such date and prior to the
Closing and, in such event, only in a manner consistent with the Transaction
Accounting Principles.

  



  

   

-31-

 



    



  

(c)  As promptly as reasonably possible and in any event within
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare or cause to
be prepared, and will provide to Seller, a written statement (the " _Post-
Closing Statement_ "), setting forth Purchaser's good-faith calculation of
the Adjustment Amount, the Closing Cash Amounts and the Closing Funded
Debt. The Post-Closing Statement shall set forth in reasonable detail
Purchaser's calculations of such amounts in a manner consistent with the
Sample Closing Statement and shall be prepared in accordance with the
Transaction Accounting Principles, including the use of the same line items
and line item entries set forth on and used in the preparation of the Sample
Closing Statement.

  



  

(d)  Within sixty (60) days following receipt by Seller of the
Post-Closing Statement, Seller shall deliver written notice to Purchaser of
any dispute Seller has with respect to the calculation, preparation or content
of the Post-Closing Statement (the  " _Dispute Notice_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if Seller does not deliver any Dispute Notice to
Purchaser within such sixty (60)-day period, the Post-Closing Statement will
be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The Dispute Notice shall set
forth in reasonable detail (i) any item on the Post-Closing Statement that
Seller disputes, together with reasonable detail of the basis for such
dispute, and (ii) Seller's calculation of the amount of such item. Upon
receipt by Purchaser of a Dispute Notice, Purchaser and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute set forth therein. If
Purchaser and Seller fail to resolve any such dispute within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Dispute Notice (the " _Dispute Resolution Period_ "),
then Purchaser and Seller jointly shall engage, within ten (10) Business Days
following the expiration of the Dispute Resolution Period, Grant Thornton LLP
or, if Grant Thornton LLP is unavailable or conflicted, another
nationally recognized independent accounting firm selected jointly by Seller
and Purchaser (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve any such
dispute; _provided_ that, if Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on the
Independent Accounting Firm, then each of Seller and Purchaser shall select a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm, and the two (2) firms
will mutually select a third (3rd) nationally recognized independent
accounting firm to serve as the Independent Accounting Firm. As promptly as
practicable, and in any event not more than fifteen (15) days following the
engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, Purchaser and Seller shall
each prepare and submit a presentation detailing such Party's complete
statement of proposed resolution of each issue still in dispute to the
Independent Accounting Firm (and such presentation, and all other
communications with the Independent Accounting Firm, will be simultaneously
made or delivered to the other Party). Purchaser and Seller shall instruct
the Independent Accounting Firm to, as soon as practicable after the
submission of the presentations described in the immediately preceding
sentence and in any event not more than twenty (20) days following such
presentations, make a final determination of the appropriate amount of each
of the line items that remain in dispute as indicated in the Dispute Notice
(and that have not been thereafter resolved by written agreement of the
Parties); _provided_ , that the failure of the Independent Accounting Firm to
strictly conform to or comply with any deadlines or time periods specified in
this _Section 2.9(d)_ shall not render the determination of the Independent
Accounting Firm invalid or form the basis for which any Party may dispute or
otherwise reject any final determination made by the Independent Accounting
Firm hereunder. With respect to each disputed line item, such determination,
if not in accordance with the position of either Seller or Purchaser, shall
not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts
advocated by Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, in the Dispute Notice and the
Post-Closing Statement, respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm shall
be limited to those line items that remain in dispute as indicated in the
Dispute Notice (and that have not been thereafter resolved by written
agreement of the Parties) and whether any disputed determinations of the
Adjustment Amount, the Closing Cash Amounts and the Closing Funded Debt were
properly calculated in accordance with the Transaction Accounting Principles
and the provisions of this Agreement. All fees and expenses relating to the
work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
allocated between Seller and Purchaser in the same proportion that the
aggregate dollar amount of line items unsuccessfully disputed or defended, as
the case may be, by each such Party (as finally determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm) bears to the total dollar amount of disputed line items
presented by both Parties. All determinations made by the Independent
Accounting Firm, and the Post-Closing Statement, as modified by the
Independent Accounting Firm and to reflect any items resolved by
written agreement of the Parties, will be final, conclusive and binding on
the Parties absent manifest error.

  



  

   

-32-

 



    



  

(e)  For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this
_Section 2.9_, each of Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with
and make available to each other, the Independent Accounting Firm and each of
their respective Representatives all information, records, data and working
papers (including auditors' work papers), in each case to the extent related
to the Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities, Business, or Purchased
Companies (and Subsidiaries thereof), and shall permit access to its and
their facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection
with the preparation, analysis and review of the Post-Closing Statement and
the resolution of any disputes thereunder; provided that access to work papers
of the auditor of either Party shall be subject to such auditors' normal
disclosure procedures and execution of a customary agreement relating to such
access to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
auditor.

  



  

(f)  The " _Final Purchase Price_ " means the Base Purchase
Price, _plus_ (i) the Closing Cash Amounts,  _plus_ (ii) the Adjustment
Amount (which may be a positive or negative number), _minus_ (iii) _ _ the
Closing Funded Debt, in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)_.

  



  

(g)  If the Closing Purchase Price shall exceed the Final
Purchase Price, then Seller shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash
equal to such excess to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Purchaser to Seller;
or if the Final Purchase Price shall exceed the Closing Purchase Price, then
Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such
excess to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Seller to Purchaser. Any such
payment is to be made within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the
Adjustment Amount, the Closing Cash Amounts and the Closing Funded Debt are
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_.

  



  

(h)  The process set forth in this _Section 2.9_ (and _Section
2.12_) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of any of the Parties and their
respective Affiliates for any disputes related to the Closing Working Capital,
the Adjustment Amount, the Closing Cash Amounts, the Closing Funded Debt, the
Closing Purchase Price, the Final Purchase Price and the calculations
and amounts on which they are based or set forth in the related statements
and notices delivered in connection therewith.

Section 2.10   _Additional Purchase Price; SPRU Claim_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, following the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller in cash
an aggregate amount (the " _Additional Purchase Price_ ") equal to ninety
percent (90%) of any cash or cash equivalents actually paid to, received by
or otherwise recovered by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any of its or
their successors or assigns, in each case arising out of, relating to or
resulting from any SPRU Claims (any such cash or cash equivalents, "
_SPRU Claim Recoveries_ ").

  



  

(b)  Purchaser shall deliver to Seller, by wire transfer in
immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Additional Purchase Price
in respect of such SPRU Claim Recovery within ten (10) Business Days of
Purchaser's or its Affiliates' or their applicable successor's or assign's
receipt of any SPRU Claim Recovery (net of any costs and expenses for which
Purchaser is entitled to reimbursement from Seller pursuant to _Section
2.10(f)_).

  



  

(c)  From and after the Closing and until the final resolution
of all SPRU Claims, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
reasonable best efforts to pursue all SPRU Claims in substantially the same
manner as Seller and its Affiliates pursued such SPRU Claims prior to the
Closing (without limiting the remaining provisions of this _Section 2.10_ ).

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Purchaser's legal team shall keep Seller reasonably informed of developments
with respect to, and reasonably coordinate with Seller's internal legal team
in the pursuit, prosecution or settlement of, any SPRU Claims, and Seller
shall control all strategic decisions with respect to the pursuit, prosecution
or settlement by Purchaser or its Affiliates of any SPRU Claim, including
with respect to litigation strategy and any decisions related to the matters
described in the following sentence; _provided_ , that Seller will reasonably
consult with Purchaser and give good faith consideration to Purchaser's
proposals with respect to any such strategic decisions. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, without the prior written consent of Seller,
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
Representatives not to, in each case with respect to or in connection with any
SPRU Claim: (i) engage, modify or terminate the engagement of, outside
counsel or any other third-party advisor; (ii) make any filing with or other
submission to any Governmental Entity, including in any Proceeding, or
provide any substantive written correspondence to or engage in
any substantive communications with any counterparty to any SPRU Claim (or
any Representative of any such counterparty); or (iii) settle, resolve,
compromise or consent to the entry of any Judgment. Purchaser shall provide
Seller with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity for Seller or its
Representatives to attend or participate in any meeting, telephone call,
virtual meeting, videoconference or other similar non-written interaction of
Purchaser or its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives with
any Governmental Entity or counterparty to any SPRU Claim (or any
Representative of the foregoing), in each case with respect to any SPRU Claim.

  



  

   

-34-

 



    



  

(e)  From and after the Closing and until the final resolution
of all SPRU Claims, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with Seller and its Affiliates and
Representatives in connection with the pursuit, prosecution or settlement of
any SPRU Claim, including by making available personnel, and providing
information and access to books and records, Contracts and properties of
Purchaser and its Affiliates, in each case in accordance with applicable Law
and as may be reasonably requested in connection with the pursuit,
prosecution or settlement of any SPRU Claim, including to allow Seller to
exercise its rights pursuant to _Section 2.10(d)_. Seller and Purchaser
and/or their respective Affiliates shall enter into one or more customary
common interest agreements to facilitate the sharing of any information
provided pursuant to this _Section 2.10(e)_.

  



  

(f)  The reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including fees of outside counsel and costs of litigation) incurred
by Purchaser and its Affiliates and Seller and its Affiliates in connection
with the pursuit, prosecution or settlement of any SPRU Claims shall be borne
ninety percent (90%) by Seller and ten percent (10%) by Purchaser. Each Party
shall reimburse the other (or if mutually agreed by the Parties, such amounts
may be net settled) accordingly on a quarterly basis, within sixty (60) days
of the end of each calendar quarter; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event any such costs and expenses exceed $300,000 in any calendar quarter,
upon Purchaser's request, Seller shall contribute ninety percent (90%) to the
payment of such costs and expenses directly (rather than through
reimbursement on a quarterly basis).

  



  

(g)  Nothing in this _Section 2.10_, or any other action taken
in accordance with _Section 2.13_, shall constitute the transfer of any
Government Contract, or any interest in a Government Contract, in violation of
41 U.S.C. § 6305(a).

  



  

Section 2.11   _Close-Out Joint Venture Cash_. In the event that any
Cash Amounts of any Close-Out Joint Ventures (or Subsidiaries thereof) are,
following the Closing (and after the repayment of any Funded Debt of the
Close-Out Joint Ventures or their Subsidiaries), actually distributed, paid
or otherwise transferred from the applicable Close-Out Joint Venture (or
Subsidiary thereof) to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any other Person
on behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or in respect of its or their
current or former direct or indirect equity interest in such Close-Out Joint
Venture (or Subsidiary thereof), Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller,
by wire transfer in immediately available funds, any such Cash Amounts as and
when so distributed, paid or otherwise transferred.

  



  

Section 2.12   _Intended Tax Treatment; Purchase Price Allocation_.

  



  

(a)  Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that as a result of the
consummation of the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Tax basis of the Purchased Assets set forth in _Section
2.12(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (the " _Transferred Purchased
Assets_ ") in the hands of the Purchaser (or its applicable Affiliate)
immediately after Closing for U.S. federal income Tax purposes shall equal
the fair market value of such Transferred Purchased Asset (the "
_Transferred Purchased Asset Value_ " and the Tax treatment described in this
_Section 2.12(a)_, the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ ").

  



  

   

-35-

 



    



  

(b)  For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, Seller and Purchaser
agree to allocate the Final Purchase Price and any other amounts treated as
consideration for such tax purposes, among the shares treated as directly sold
to Purchaser for U.S. federal income tax purposes in accordance with _Exhibit
A_ hereto (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ").

  



  

(c)  No later than ninety (90) days after the date on which the
Final Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.9_, Seller
shall deliver to Purchaser a proposed allocation of the Final Purchase Price
as of the Closing Date among the shares of Purchased Entities treated as
directly sold to Purchaser for U.S. federal income tax purposes(and further
among any assets deemed sold to Purchaser), determined in a manner consistent
with the Allocation Schedule and applicable Tax Law (the " _Seller
's Allocation_"). If Purchaser disagrees with Seller's Allocation, Purchaser
may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of Seller's Allocation deliver a
notice (the " _Purchaser 's Notice_") to Seller to such effect,
specifying those items as to which Purchaser disagrees and setting forth
Purchaser's proposed allocation. If the Purchaser's Notice is duly and timely
delivered, Seller and Purchaser shall, during the thirty (30) days following
such delivery, use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts in order to determine the allocation. If Seller and
Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter
cause the Independent Accounting Firm (who shall be promptly engaged if not
previously engaged in accordance with _Section 2.9_) to resolve any remaining
disputes. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed
by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Seller and
Purchaser. Any allocation determined pursuant to the decision of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent with
the Allocation Schedule, unless otherwise required by a change in applicable
Law after the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(d)  The allocation, as prepared by Seller if no Purchaser's
Notice has been duly and timely delivered with respect to Seller's
Allocation, as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between Seller and Purchaser
or as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with
_Section 2.12(c)_ (the " _Allocation_ "), shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties absent manifest error. None of Seller or Purchaser
shall (and they shall cause their respective Affiliates not to) take any
position inconsistent with the Allocation or the Intended Tax Treatment on any
Tax Return or in any Tax Proceeding, in each case, except to the extent
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code (or any analogous provision of state, local or foreign
law).

  



  

Section 2.13   _Non-Assignment; Consents_.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer or
convey any Purchased Asset if an attempted sale, assignment, transfer or
conveyance thereof in connection with the Transaction or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement would be prohibited by Law or
would, without the approval, authorization or consent of, Filing with, or
granting or issuance of any license, order, waiver or permit by, any third
party or Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Approvals_ "), (i) constitute
a breach or other contravention in respect thereof, (ii) be ineffective, void
or voidable, or (iii) adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Seller
Entities, Purchaser, or any of their respective officers, directors, agents
or Affiliates, unless and until such Approval is obtained.

  



  

   

-36-

 



    



   



  

(b)  Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain promptly, or cause to be obtained promptly, at no cost to Seller or
any of its Affiliates, any Approval (other than Regulatory Approvals, which
shall be governed by _Section 5.1_) required to sell, assign or transfer any
Purchased Asset and to obtain the unconditional release of Seller and its
Affiliates so that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be solely
responsible for the Assumed Liabilities. If any such Approval is not obtained
prior to Closing, the Closing shall nonetheless take place subject only to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_, and
until the earlier of (1) such time as such Approval or Approvals are obtained
and (2) the later of (A) six (6) years following the Closing and (B) to the
extent any such Approval is in respect of a Purchased Asset that is or arises
out of a Contract, the expiration of such Contract in accordance with its
terms, the Parties will cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to
implement any arrangement reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller
intended to both (x) provide Purchaser, to the fullest extent practicable, the
claims, rights and benefits of any such Purchased Assets and (y) cause
Purchaser to bear all costs and Liabilities thereunder from and after the
Closing in accordance with this Agreement (including by means of any
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement). In furtherance of
the foregoing, from and after the Closing, Purchaser will promptly pay,
satisfy, perform and discharge when due any Liability (including any
liability for Taxes) arising thereunder and shall be responsible for all
Assumed Liabilities related thereto in accordance with this Agreement;
_provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, Seller's obligation to
implement any such arrangement shall not require Seller or any of its
Affiliates to obtain or provide any letter of credit, bond or other credit
support with respect to any such Purchased Asset. Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event that any of the Approvals set forth on _Section
2.13(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules are not obtained prior to the
Closing, Seller and Purchaser agree to use reasonable best efforts to take
the actions set forth on Section 2.13(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Agreement shall require Seller or any of its Affiliates to
sell, assign, transfer or convey any Excluded Asset from the Purchased
Companies or their Subsidiaries (or from the Seller Entities) to Seller or
one or more of its Affiliates if an attempted sale, assignment, transfer or
conveyance thereof in connection with the Transaction or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement would be prohibited by Law or
would, without an Approval, (i) constitute a breach or other contravention in
respect thereof, (ii) be ineffective, void or voidable, or (iii) adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Seller Entities, or any of their
respective officers, directors, agents or Affiliates, unless and until such
Approval is obtained.

  



  

(d)  If any such Approval referred to in _Section 2.13(c)_ is
not obtained prior to Closing, the Closing shall nonetheless take place
subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article VIII_, and until the earlier of (1) such time as such Approvals are
obtained and (2) the later of (A) six (6) years following the Closing and (B)
to the extent any such Approval is in respect of an Excluded Asset that is or
arises out of a Contract, the expiration of such Contract in accordance with
its terms, the Parties will cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts
to implement any arrangement reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller
intended to both (x) provide Seller, to the fullest extent practicable, the
claims, rights and benefits of any such Excluded Asset and (y) cause Seller
to bear all costs and Liabilities thereunder from and after the Closing
in accordance with this Agreement (including by means of any subcontracting,
sublicensing or subleasing arrangement). In furtherance of the foregoing,
from and after the Closing, Seller will promptly pay, satisfy, perform and
discharge when due any Liability (including any liability for Taxes) arising
thereunder and shall be responsible for all Retained Liabilities related
thereto in accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ , that, for the
avoidance of doubt, Purchaser's obligation to implement any such
arrangement shall not require Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to obtain or
provide any letter of credit, bond or other credit support with respect to
any such Excluded Asset.

  



  

   

-37-

 



    



  

(e)  Any Contract entered into prior to the Closing with a third
party to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party that does not
exclusively relate to the Business (and is not otherwise set forth on _Section
2.4(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules) but inures to the benefit or
burden of both the Business and the Retained Businesses, other than any
enterprise-wide Contracts, Contracts with respect to off-the-shelf software
and Contracts with any Taxing Authority (each, a " _Shared Contract_ ") shall
constitute a Purchased Asset and be assigned, transferred and conveyed subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the other provisions
of this _Section 2.13_) only with respect to (and preserving the meaning of)
those parts that relate to the Business, to either a Purchased Entity (or
Subsidiary thereof) or Purchaser, if so assignable, transferrable or
conveyable, or appropriately amended prior to, on or after the Closing, so
that Purchaser shall be entitled to the rights and benefits of those parts of
the Shared Contract that relate to the Business and shall assume the related
portion of any Liabilities contemplated by _Section 2.6_ of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall any Person be required to
assign (or amend), either in its entirety or in part, any Shared Contract that
is not assignable (or cannot be amended) by its terms without obtaining one
or more Approvals, unless and until such Approval or Approvals are obtained
and (ii) if any Shared Contract cannot be so partially assigned by its terms
or otherwise, or cannot be amended, without such Approval or Approvals, until
the earlier of such time as such Approval or Approvals are obtained and two
(2) years following the Closing, the Parties will cooperate and use
commercially reasonable efforts to establish an agency type or other similar
arrangement reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser intended to both
(x) provide Purchaser, to the fullest extent practicable under such Shared
Contract, the claims, rights and benefits of those parts that relate to the
Business and (y) cause Purchaser to bear all costs and Liabilities of those
parts that relate to the Business, from and after the Closing in accordance
with this Agreement (including by means of any subcontracting, sublicensing
or subleasing arrangement).

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any transfer or assignment to Purchaser of any Purchased Asset or
any part of a Shared Contract that shall require an Approval as described
above in this _Section 2.13_ shall be made subject to such Approval being
obtained, and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to
agree to any arrangement or take any action in connection with the matters
contemplated by this _Section 2.13_ that would, based on advice of counsel,
(i) constitute a breach or other contravention in respect of any Purchased
Assets or Shared Contract, (ii) be ineffective, void or voidable, (iii)
adversely affect the contractual rights of the Seller Entities or any of their
respective officers, directors, agents or Affiliates or (iv) with respect to
any Shared Contract, require Seller or any of its Affiliates to pay or commit
to pay any amount or incur any obligation in favor of or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise, regardless of any provision to the
contrary in the underlying Contract, including any requirements for the
securing or posting of any bonds, letters of credit or similar instruments,
or the furnishing of any guarantees) to any Person. Without limiting _Section
2.13(b)_, notwithstanding the fact that any applicable Approval is not
obtained prior to the Closing, each of the assets described in _Section
2.4_ shall be deemed to be Purchased Assets under this Agreement and each of
the Liabilities described in _Section 2.6_ shall be deemed to be Assumed
Liabilities under this Agreement, including in each case for purposes of the
calculation of Working Capital.

Section 2.14   _Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any payment of the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any Seller Entity only such amounts as Purchaser is required
to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment; provided, that
(a) at least ten (10) days prior to making any deduction or withholding,
Purchaser shall notify Seller (which notice shall include a statement of the
amounts it intends to deduct or withhold in respect of making such payment and
the applicable provision of law requiring it to withhold or deduct) and a
reasonable opportunity for Seller to provide such forms or other evidence that
would eliminate or reduce any such deduction or withholding and (b) Purchaser
shall cooperate in good faith with Seller to reduce or eliminate such
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld by Purchaser and timely paid over to the applicable Governmental
Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made. Purchaser shall furnish to Seller evidence
of the payment to the applicable Governmental Entity of any amount deducted
and withheld pursuant to this _Section 2.14_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section 2.14_, to the extent any Taxes are required to
be deducted or withheld from any payments hereunder, and such Taxes would not
otherwise have been required to be withheld or deducted but for an
assignment pursuant to _Section 11.3_ (such Taxes, " _Assignment Withholding
Taxes_ "), then, in the case that the assigning Party (or its applicable
Affiliate) is the payor, the sum payable by such payor in respect of which
such Assignment Withholding Taxes are required to be deducted or withheld
shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after all such
required deductions or withholdings of Assignment Withholding Taxes, the
party to whom such payment is made receives the amount it would have received
had no Assignment Withholding Taxes been required to be withheld or deducted.

commitment letter dated October 12, 2019 (together with all exhibits and

agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide debt financing
in the amounts set forth therein. The debt financing committed pursuant to
the Debt Commitment Letter is referred to in this Agreement as the  " _Debt

Securities Partners VIII, L.P., American Securities Partners VIII(B), L.P.,
Lindsay Goldberg IV L.P., Lindsay Goldberg IV - A L.P. and Lindsay Goldberg

correct copies of the executed Commitment Letters and any fee letters
related thereto, subject, in the case of such fee letters, to redaction
solely of fee and other economic provisions that are customarily redacted in

aggregate amount of, the Debt Financing. The Equity Commitment Letter provides
that Seller is an express third-party beneficiary of, and is entitled to
enforce, the Equity Commitment Letter.

  



  

(d)  Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters,
there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Equity

Financing, as applicable, or any contingencies that would permit the Equity
Investors to reduce the amount of the Cash Equity or the Financing Entities to
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, including any condition or
other contingency relating to the amount or availability of the Debt Financing
pursuant to any "flex" provision. As of the date hereof, (i) Purchaser does

enforceability or conditionality of, or reduce the aggregate amount of, the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters.

  



  

   

-64-

 



    



  

(e)  The Financing, when funded in accordance with the
Commitment Letters, will provide Purchaser with cash proceeds on the
Closing Date (or, in the case of any Transaction Amounts (as defined below)
due and payable on a date after the Closing Date, on such subsequent date)
sufficient to enable Purchaser to perform all of Purchaser's payment
obligations under this Agreement, the Commitment Letters and the other

(f)  As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters constitute
the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Purchaser, and to
the Knowledge of Purchaser, of all the other parties thereto, in each case,
except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or law), and, as of
the date of this Agreement, are in full force and effect. As of the date of
this Agreement, (i) no event has occurred which (with or without notice,
lapse of time or both) could constitute a breach by Purchaser of the terms of
the Commitment Letters, and (ii) Purchaser does not have any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied
by Purchaser on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to
Purchaser on the Closing Date. Purchaser has paid in full any and all
commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of
the Commitment Letters on or before the date of this Agreement, and will pay

this Agreement, the Commitment Letters have not been modified, amended or
altered and none of the respective commitments under any of the Commitment
Letters have been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, no withdrawal or rescission thereof is
contemplated. As of the date of this Agreement, no modification of, or
amendment to, the Commitment Letters is currently contemplated (other than,
in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter, (i) any customary modification or
amendment solely to join additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents
or managers to the Debt Commitment Letter as contemplated thereunder, which
joinders, individually and in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected
to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Transaction or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) a replacement
second-lien facility of the type described in Section 10 of the Debt
Commitment Letter as in effect as of the date hereof (which replacement shall
comply with the requirements of _Section 5.7_) (the " _Second Lien
Replacement_ ")).

  



  

(g)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or
financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by or to
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any other financing or
other transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Purchaser
hereunder.

Agreement, Purchaser has delivered to Seller a true, complete and
correct copy of the executed Guaranty. The Guaranty is valid, binding and

would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect. Purchaser and its Affiliates collectively possess all Permits
necessary for the conduct of their respective businesses, as currently
conducted, except where the failure to possess any such Permit would not have,

state and foreign securities Laws or pursuant to an applicable exemption

satisfaction an independent investigation of the financial condition,
results of operations and projected operations of the Business and the nature
and condition of its properties, assets, liabilities and businesses and, in
making the determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated hereby,

and the covenants and obligations made to Purchaser by the Seller Entities in
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, Purchaser is relinquishing

Section 5.1   _Efforts_.

  



  

(a)  From and after the date hereof, Purchaser and Seller shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their respective best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Law to
consummate and make effective as promptly as reasonably practicable (but
subject to the proviso to the first sentence of _Section 2.3_) the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (i) the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations, Filings
and notices required to be filed to satisfy the conditions precedent to this
Agreement (including those set forth in _Section 8.1_) and to consummate the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon
as practicable and (ii) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser and
Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their
respective best efforts to obtain (and shall cooperate with each other in
obtaining) any Regulatory Approvals (which actions shall include furnishing
all information required in connection with such Regulatory Approvals)
required to be obtained or made by Purchaser, Seller, the other Seller
Entities or the Purchased Entities (or Subsidiaries thereof) or any of their
Affiliates in connection with the Transaction or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Additionally, Purchaser and Seller shall not,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, take any action after the
date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to impair or
materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any Regulatory
Approval necessary to be obtained prior to the Closing. Without limiting the
foregoing, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
acquire or agree to acquire, by merger, consolidation, stock or asset
purchase or otherwise, any business or corporation, partnership or other

(b)  Prior to the Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall each keep
the other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to
the completion of the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all
required Regulatory Approvals. In that regard, prior to the Closing, subject
to the Confidentiality Agreements and  _Section 5.3_, each Party shall
promptly consult with the other Party to provide any necessary information
with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other Party
(or its counsel) copies of) all Filings made by such Party or any of its
Affiliates with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by
such Party or any of its Affiliates to, or correspondence with, a
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreements and _Section 5.3_, each Party shall promptly
inform the other Party, and if in writing, furnish the other Party with
copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other Party
orally of) any communication received by such Party or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives from any Governmental Entity regarding the Transaction and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and permit the other
Party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
of the other Party in connection with, any proposed communication with any
such Governmental Entity. If either Party or any Affiliate or Representative
of such Party receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transaction or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such Party will make,
or cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other Party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. Neither Party nor its
respective Affiliates or Representatives shall participate in any meeting
with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or make
oral submissions at meetings or in telephone or other conversations) unless it
consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreements and _Section
5.3_, each Party shall furnish the other Party with copies of all
correspondence and Filings (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
between it or any of its Affiliates or Representatives, on the one hand, and
any Governmental Entity, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and furnish the other Party with such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of Filings to any such Governmental Entity. Purchaser
and Seller may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate
any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this
Agreement as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel and will
not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors
of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be) or its
legal counsel; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials provided pursuant to
this Agreement may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the
valuation of or future plans for the Business or the Sale Process, (ii)
as necessary to comply with contractual obligations or applicable Law and
(iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

as practicable, but in any event no later than ten (10) days after the date
of this Agreement, notifications under the HSR Act, and Purchaser and Seller
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, file as promptly as
practicable any other Filings under applicable Antitrust Laws, but in any
event, any initial draft notifications of any other Filings shall be submitted
no later than twenty (20) days after the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(d)  In furtherance of the foregoing, and notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, take all such action as may be necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable Law with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby and to resolve such objections, if any,
as any Governmental Entity or any other Person may assert under any
applicable Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible but subject to the
proviso to the first sentence of _Section 2.3_ (and in any event so as to
enable the Closing to occur prior to the Outside Date). In furtherance of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall proffer to and agree to sell, divest, lease,
license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate, before
or after the Closing, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product
lines, businesses or interests therein of the Business or of Purchaser or its
Affiliates (and consent to any sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer,
disposition or other encumbering by the Seller Entities of any assets of the
Business or to any agreement by any of the Seller Entities to take any of the
foregoing actions) and agree to make any material changes (including through
a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of
Purchaser's ability to own, retain or operate, any such assets, licenses,
product lines, businesses or interests therein or Purchaser's ability to
vote, transfer, receive dividends, or otherwise exercise full ownership rights
with respect to ownership interests in the Business or of Purchaser or its
Affiliates, including any actions that may be required to be taken to
neutralize, mitigate or resolve any organizational conflict of interest to
the extent necessary to obtain any Regulatory Approval. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller and its Affiliates shall
not be obligated to take or agree or commit to take any action (i) that is
not conditioned on the Closing or (ii) that relates to any Excluded Assets or
Retained Businesses; and in no event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates be
required to be the licensing, selling, divesting, leasing, transferring,
disposing or encumbering party under any such agreements unless required by
the relevant Governmental Entity or applicable Law, and, in any case, Seller
and its Affiliates shall have no direct or indirect obligation or Liability in
respect of any such agreements, transactions or relationships, including any
indemnification obligations, for which Seller and its Affiliates are not fully
indemnified by Purchaser.

  



  

(e)  Whether or not the Transaction is consummated, Purchaser
shall be responsible for all filing and similar fees and payments payable to
any Governmental Entity in order to obtain any Approvals pursuant to this
Agreement, excluding, for avoidance of doubt, the fees of and payments to
Seller's legal and professional advisors and fees, costs and expenses solely
related to any Approvals required by Seller or its Affiliates to complete the
Pre-Closing Restructuring Steps that would not otherwise have been
required in connection with the Transaction.

(f)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, except as required by Seller or its Affiliates to complete the Pre-
Closing Restructuring Steps (and as would not otherwise have been required in
connection with the Transaction), none of Seller, the other Seller Entities
or any of their respective Affiliates shall under any circumstance be required
to pay or commit to pay any amount or incur any obligation in favor of or
offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise, regardless of any
provision to the contrary in the underlying Contract, including any
requirements for the securing or posting of any bonds, letters of credit or
similar instruments, or the furnishing of any guarantees) to any Person to
obtain any Approval that may be required in connection with the Transaction
(other than any Approval required to effect the completion of the Pre-Closing
Restructuring Steps that would not otherwise have been required in connection
with the Transaction). None of Seller, the other Seller Entities or any of
their respective Affiliates shall have any Liability whatsoever to Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain
any Approvals that may be required in connection with the Transaction and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of the
termination of any Contract or any default under, or acceleration or
termination of or loss of any benefit under, any Contract or other Purchased
Asset as a result of the Transaction or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided that Seller shall have complied in
all material respects with its obligations hereunder. For the avoidance of
doubt, Seller's and its Affiliates' obligations under this _Section 5.1_
shall be subject in all respects to the applicable provisions of _Section
2.13_.

  



  

(g)  As promptly as is reasonably practicable following
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the receipt by Seller of all
information relating to Purchaser and its Affiliates required in connection
with such notifications, Seller shall submit to DCSA, and, to the extent
required by Law, any other CSA, a notification of the Transaction and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to section
1-302(g) of the NISPOM. Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate in
requesting from DCSA and any other such CSA approval for the continuation of
all U.S. government facility security clearances necessary to conduct the
Business in all material respects as presently conducted.

to the Excluded Assets, the Retained Liabilities or the Retained Businesses,
from the date of this Agreement to the Closing, and except as Purchaser may
otherwise consent in writing to (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), Seller shall, and shall cause each other Seller
Entity and each Purchased Entity (and Subsidiary thereof) to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall vote its interest in any
Purchased Ventures (to the extent any relevant matter is voted upon by the
holders of interests in the applicable Purchased Venture and the
organizational documents of the applicable Purchased Venture grant Seller or
such other Seller Entity or Purchased Entity or Subsidiary thereof the right
to vote on such matter) and take such other action to the extent within its
control so as to cause such Purchased Venture to use commercially reasonable
efforts to, conduct the Business in all material respects in the ordinary
course of business and preserve intact its current business organization; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that no action by Seller or its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters specifically addressed by any other provision of this
_Section 5.2_ shall be deemed a breach of this _Section 5.2(a)_ unless such
action would constitute a breach of such other provision.

incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and shall survive the

the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, Purchaser's direct and
indirect limited partners shall be deemed to be Representatives (as such term

months, the Confidentiality Agreements shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of twenty-four (24) months following termination of this

Seller is a party that was entered into with a potential purchaser of the
Business (or a material portion thereof) in connection with the Sale Process

Business was furnished within the last year by or on behalf of Seller in
connection with any actual or potential proposal by such Person to acquire the
Business (or any material portion thereof), to, and to cause such Person's
applicable representatives to, promptly return or destroy all such
confidential information to the extent required by such Sale Process NDAs.
Prior to the termination of this Agreement, without Purchaser's prior
written consent, Seller shall not release any third party from, or waive,
amend or modify any provision of, any Sale Process NDA. From and after the
Closing, to the extent such Sale Process NDAs are not assigned to a Purchased
Entity prior to Closing, Seller agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
enforce its rights under any Sale Process NDA for the benefit of Purchaser, as
Purchaser reasonably requests in writing, at the sole cost and expense of
Purchaser.

(b)  Seller hereby agrees with Purchaser that it shall not, and
shall not permit its Affiliates or their respective Representatives to, for a
period of thirty-six (36) months after the Closing Date, directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, disclose to any
third party (other than Seller's Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives) any confidential or proprietary information included in or
to the extent relating to the Purchased Assets or the Business ("
_Confidential Business Information_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
term "Confidential Business Information" will not include any information (i)
that becomes available to Seller or its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives from and after the Closing, from a third party source that is
not known by Seller to be under any obligations of confidentiality in respect
of such information or (ii) that is or becomes generally available to, or
known by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation
hereof). In addition, Seller shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates or
their respective Representatives to, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, disclose any Confidential Business Information that constitutes a
trade secret under applicable law until the earlier of (x) seven (7) years
from the date hereof and (y) such time as such Confidential Business
Information no longer constitutes a trade secret under applicable law (other
than as a result of disclosure by Seller, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives in violation of this _Section 5.3(b)_). The
immediately preceding two sentences shall not prohibit Seller, its Affiliates
or any of their respective Representatives (A) from using Confidential
Business Information for the purpose of complying with the terms of this
Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents or any Contract that has not
been assigned or transferred pursuant to _Section 2.13_, or (B) from
disclosing Confidential Business Information that Seller, any of its
Affiliates or its or their Representatives are required by Law (by oral
questions, interrogatories, requests for information, subpoena, civil
investigative demand, or similar process) or requested by any
Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over such Person to disclose (
_provided_ that Seller will, to the extent not legally prohibited, provide
Purchaser with prompt written notice of such request so that Purchaser may
seek, at its sole expense, an appropriate protective order and/or waive
compliance with this _Section 5.3(b)_). Furthermore, the provisions of this
_Section 5.3(b)_ will not prohibit any retention of copies of records or any
disclosure in connection with the preparation and filing of
financial statements or Tax Returns of Seller or its Affiliates or any
disclosure made in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy
relating to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that (x) Seller, the Seller Entities and their respective Affiliates
currently, and following the Closing may continue to, maintain and expand
business and commercial relationships (whether as a customer, supplier or
otherwise) with the same Persons and engage in commercial relationships with
such Persons and with Purchaser, and, subject to compliance with _Section
5.15(a)_, may employ, or continue to employ, individuals who previously
worked in or with the Business and possess knowledge and Know-How used in,
relating to, or arising from the Business and (y) nothing in this _Section
5.3(b)_ shall prohibit or restrict the maintenance or expansion of any such
relationships or employment of any such individuals; _provided_ that
Confidential Business Information is not disclosed in violation hereof.

contemplated by this Agreement, to the properties, books, Contracts, records,
assets, officers, agents and personnel, in each case of Seller and its
Subsidiaries, related to the Business and the Purchased Companies (and
Subsidiaries thereof) that constitute Purchased Assets; _provided_ ,

required to violate any obligation of confidentiality to which it or any of
its Affiliates may be subject in discharging their obligations pursuant to
this _Section 5.4_; (ii) Seller shall make available, or cause its
Subsidiaries to make available, Business Employee personnel files only after
the Closing Date and, with respect to any Business Employees, if and when all
legal requirements to the transfer of such files have been satisfied (
_provided_ , that, unless required by Purchaser to satisfy its obligations
under _Article VI_, Seller shall not make, or cause to be made, available
medical records, workers' compensation records or the results of any drug
testing; and that Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller and its
Affiliates (including the other Seller Entities) harmless from any Liabilities
arising out of or relating to Purchaser's and its Affiliates' use of such
personnel files); and (iii) prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not

written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to
provide access to or disclose information (i) where, based on advice of
counsel, such access or disclosure would jeopardize attorney-client or other
applicable privilege or protection, or contravene any Laws or contractual
obligations (it being agreed that, in the event that the restrictions set
forth in this clause (i) of this sentence apply, Seller shall inform
Purchaser as to the general nature of what is being withheld and shall
cooperate in good faith to attempt to design and implement alternative
disclosure arrangements to enable Purchaser to evaluate any such
information without violating an obligation of confidentiality to any third
party, jeopardizing the attorney-client or other applicable privilege or
protection or contravening any Laws or contractual obligations), or (ii) such
information concerns the valuation of the Business or the Sale Process.

Affiliates and their respective Representatives, during normal business hours,
upon reasonable notice, access to the properties, books, Contracts, records,
assets, officers, agents and personnel of the Business and the Purchased
Companies (and Subsidiaries thereof) to the extent that such access may be
reasonably requested by Seller in connection with financial statements, Taxes,
reporting obligations or compliance with applicable Laws or other legitimate
non-competitive purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
Agreement shall limit any of Seller's or any of its Affiliates' rights of
discovery; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Seller agrees to treat any
Confidential Business Information made available to Seller by Purchaser
pursuant to this _Section 5.4(c)_ in accordance with the confidentiality
obligations set forth in _Section 5.3(b)_ for a period of thirty-six (36)
months from the date when such information is made available to Seller. Clause

to any access provided to Seller and its Affiliates and Representatives
pursuant to this _Section 5.4(c)_.

  



  

(d)  At and after the Closing, for a period of two (2) years,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, afford Purchaser, its
Affiliates, the Purchased Companies (and Subsidiaries thereof) and their

notice, access to the records of the Seller and its Subsidiaries to the extent
that such access may be reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with
any services required to be provided by Seller and its Subsidiaries pursuant
to the Transition Services Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser
agrees that any confidential or proprietary information made available to
Purchaser by Seller pursuant to this _Section 5.4(d)_ concerning the Retained
Businesses, Seller, the other Seller Entities or any of their respective
Affiliates (other than solely with respect to the Business and the Purchased
Companies (and Subsidiaries thereof)) shall continue to remain subject to the

thereof for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date or such longer
time as may be required by Law, and thereafter, if it desires to destroy or
dispose of such books and records not in accordance with its then current
retention policy, to offer first in writing at least thirty (30) days prior
to such destruction or disposition to surrender them to Seller.

  



  

Section 5.5   _Publicity_. Neither Party nor any Affiliate or
Representative of such Party shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or public announcement in respect of this Agreement, the
Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by
Law or stock exchange rules, in which case the Party required to publish such
press release or public announcement shall use reasonable efforts to provide
the other Party a reasonable opportunity to comment on such press release or
public announcement in advance of such publication; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply to any press release or public announcement so long
as any statements contained therein concerning the Transaction or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consistent with previous
releases or announcements made by the applicable Party with respect to which
such Party has complied with the provisions of this _Section 5.5_. Seller and
Purchaser will consult with each other concerning the means by which the

Section 5.6   _Intercompany Accounts and Intercompany
Arrangements_.

  



  

(a)  Immediately prior to the Closing (or prior thereto, if so
determined by Seller), all intercompany balances and accounts (other than
intercompany balances and accounts set forth in _Section 5.6_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules) between the Seller Entities and any of their Affiliates
(other than the Purchased Entities (and Subsidiaries thereof)), on the one
hand, and the Purchased Entities (and Subsidiaries thereof), on the other
hand, shall be settled or otherwise eliminated in such a manner as the Seller
Entities shall determine in their sole discretion (and for the avoidance of
doubt Seller and its Affiliates shall be permitted to remove from any
Purchased Company (or Subsidiary thereof) any or all Cash Amounts or funds
from cash pools by means of dividends, distributions, contribution, the
creation or repayment or refinancing of intercompany debt, increasing or
decreasing of cash pool balances or otherwise at any time prior to 12:01 a.m.
(Pacific Time) on the Closing Date). Any such intercompany balances and
accounts that are settled after 12:01 a.m. (Pacific Time) on the Closing Date
but in connection with the Closing shall be deemed for purposes of this
Agreement to have been settled as of immediately prior to 12:01 a.m. (Pacific
Time) on the Closing Date. Intercompany balances and accounts solely among
any of the Purchased Entities (or Subsidiaries thereof) shall not be affected
by the above provisions of this _Section 5.6_. Immediately prior to the
Closing (or prior thereto, if so determined by Seller), except for
the Transaction Documents to be entered into in connection with this
Agreement and any arrangements, understandings or Contracts set forth in
_Section 5.6_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, all arrangements,
understandings or Contracts, including all obligations to provide goods,
services or other benefits, between the Seller Entities, on the one hand, and
the Purchased Entities (or Subsidiaries thereof), on the other hand, shall
automatically be terminated without further payment or performance and
cease to have any further force and effect, such that no party thereto shall
have any further obligations or Liabilities therefor or thereunder.

  



  

(b)  Except to the extent provided to the contrary in this
_Section 5.6_, effective as of the Closing, Purchaser, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, including the Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries,
hereby releases Seller and each of its Affiliates (and their respective
officers, directors and employees, acting in their capacities as such) from
any Liability, obligation or responsibility to any of them for any and all
past actions or failures to take action prior to the Closing directly or
indirectly relating to or arising out of the Business, the Retained
Businesses, or the operations of the Purchased Companies (or their
Subsidiaries) prior to the Closing, or relating to or arising out of Seller's
or its Affiliate's ownership of the Purchased Assets, except for any
obligation pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents and any arrangements, understandings or Contracts set
forth in _Section 5.6_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules.

  



  

(c)  Except to the extent provided to the contrary in this
_Section 5.6_, effective as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates, hereby releases the Purchaser, its Affiliates, the Purchased
Companies and their Subsidiaries (and their respective officers, directors
and employees, acting in their capacities as such) from any Liability,
obligation or responsibility to any of them for any and all past actions or
failures to take action prior to the Closing directly or indirectly relating
to or arising out of the Business, the Retained Businesses, or the operations
of the Purchased Companies (or their Subsidiaries) prior to the Closing, or
relating to or arising out of the Purchased Companies' (or their
Subsidiaries') ownership of the Purchased Assets, except for any obligation
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents and any arrangements, understandings or Contracts set forth in
_Section 5.6_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules.

Section 5.7   _Financing_.

  



  

(a)  Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain funds sufficient to fund the
Transaction Amounts as and when due. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain
the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Commitment Letters (or Permitted Other Terms (as defined below)) no later
than the date upon which the Transaction is required to be consummated
pursuant to the terms hereof, including by using its reasonable best efforts
to (i) cause the Equity Investors to maintain in effect the Equity Commitment
Letter, (ii) except as expressly permitted by _Section 5.7(c)_ , maintain in
effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_
") consistent with the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in any
related fee letter) or on other terms acceptable to Purchaser that could not
reasonably be expected to (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (unless the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, as so reduced,
when taken together with the Cash Equity, would be sufficient to fund the
Transaction Amounts as and when due), (B) impose new or additional
conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing, (C) prevent,
impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transaction or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (D) adversely affect the
ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against the other parties to such
Definitive Agreements relative to the ability of Purchaser to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect
on the date hereof (such other terms that satisfy the foregoing
requirements are referred to as " _Permitted Other Terms_ ") and (iv) satisfy
on a timely basis all conditions in the Commitment Letters and the Definitive
Agreements that are within the control of Purchaser and comply with its
obligations thereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in
the event that all conditions contained in any Commitment Letter or any
Definitive Agreement (other than the consummation of the Transaction, and
other than, with respect to the Debt Financing, the availability of the Cash
Equity) have been satisfied, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the applicable Financing Entities or Equity Investors thereunder, as
applicable, to comply with their respective obligations thereunder, including
to fund the Financing. Purchaser shall comply with its obligations, and use
reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights, under the Commitment
Letters and Definitive Agreements in a timely and diligent manner.

  



  

   

-80-

 



    



  

(b)  Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of
Seller: (i) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements
if such amendment, modification or waiver (A) adds any new (or adversely
modifies any existing) conditions to the funding of all or any portion of the
Financing, (B) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (unless the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, as so reduced, when taken together
with the Cash Equity, would be sufficient to fund the Transaction Amounts as
and when due) or reduces the amount of the Cash Equity, (C) adversely affects
the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements, in each case, as so
amended, modified or waived, relative to the ability of Purchaser to enforce
its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letters as in effect on
the date hereof or (D) could otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent,
impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transaction or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (ii) terminate any Commitment
Letter (other than, in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter, upon
the effectiveness of the applicable Definitive Agreement or as otherwise
expressly permitted by _Section 5.7(c)_ ) or any Definitive Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of
the Debt Commitment Letter, Purchaser may make customary modifications or
amendments solely to (x) join additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners,
agents or managers to the Debt Commitment Letter as contemplated thereunder
if the addition of such Persons, individually and in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation
of the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(it being understood that the aggregate commitments of the lenders party to
the Debt Commitment Letter prior to such amendment or modification (but not
the aggregate commitments thereunder, unless the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing under such commitments, as so reduced, when taken together with the
Cash Equity, would be sufficient to fund the Transaction Amounts as and when
due) may be reduced in the amount of such additional party's commitment); and
(y) implement the "market flex" provisions of the fee letter entered into in
connection with the Debt Commitment Letter. Purchaser shall promptly deliver
to Seller copies of any amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of the
Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements.

  



  

(c)  In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable (other than as a result of a replacement thereof permitted as set
forth below), regardless of the reason therefor, Purchaser will (i) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (in an amount
sufficient, when taken together with the Cash Equity and the available portion
of the Debt Financing, to fund the Transaction Amounts as and when due) from
the same or other sources and which does not include any conditions to the
consummation of such alternative debt financing that are more onerous than the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) promptly notify
Seller of such unavailability and the reason therefor. In addition,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser may replace all or
any portion of the Debt Financing with any other debt financing, in each
case, so long as, (A) after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing shall be in an amount that, when taken together with the Cash
Equity, would be sufficient to fund the Transactions Amounts as and when due,
(B) such alternative debt financing does not include new or additional
conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing, (C) such
replacement could not otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Transaction or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (D) the terms of such
replacement do not adversely affect the ability of Purchaser to enforce its
rights against the other parties to such replacement financing relative to the
ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Debt Financing" shall be deemed to include any
required or optional alternative debt financing referred to above obtained or
proposed to be obtained by Purchaser in accordance with the provisions set
forth above, and the term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include
any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any such
required or optional alternative financing (and any Debt Commitment Letter
remaining in effect at the time in question). Purchaser shall provide Seller
with prompt oral and written notice of any actual or threatened breach,
termination, repudiation or default by any party to any Commitment Letter or
any Definitive Agreement and a copy of any written notice or other written
communication from any Lender, Equity Investor, or other financing source
with respect to any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement of any provision
thereof, in each case of which Purchaser is or becomes aware. Purchaser shall
keep Seller reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its
efforts to consummate the Financing. The foregoing notwithstanding,
compliance by Purchaser with this _Section 5.7_ shall not relieve Purchaser
of its obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement whether or not the Financing is available. In no event shall
the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser
or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of
Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

   

-81-

 



    



  

(d)  Purchaser shall give Seller prompt notice of any event
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default on the part of any Guarantor under the Guaranty.

  



  

Section 5.8   _Financing Cooperation_.

  



  

(a)  Prior to the Closing, Seller shall provide and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its Representatives to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by
Purchaser that is necessary or advisable for the arrangement and syndication
of the Debt Financing of the type contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
as in effect on the date hereof (including any Second Lien Replacement),
including by (i) using reasonable best efforts to participate in a reasonable
number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and
sessions with rating agencies, at reasonable times and with reasonable
advance notice, (ii) to the extent required by such Debt Financing, using
reasonable best efforts to facilitate the pledging of collateral (including
by delivering to Purchaser at Closing, to the extent in existence at such
time, original share certificates with respect to the Purchased Entities'
domestic Subsidiaries and the domestic Purchased Entities' first-tier foreign
Subsidiaries), effective no earlier than the Closing, (iii) furnishing to
Purchaser and the Lenders (A) the unaudited combined balance sheet of the
Business as of September 30, 2018 (and, no later than 60 days after September
30, 2019, the unaudited combined balance sheet of the Business as of
September 30, 2019; it being further agreed that, without limiting
Seller's obligation as set forth above in this parenthetical clause, if
Seller shall have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

  



  

   

-82-

furnish such balance sheet to Purchaser and the Lenders as soon as reasonably
practicable after such filing) and, in each case, the related unaudited
combined statements of operations and unaudited combined statements of cash
flows of the Business for the fiscal years then ended, (B) the unaudited

days after the end of such fiscal quarter, each subsequent fiscal quarter of
the Business ended thereafter (other than the fourth fiscal quarter of any
fiscal year), in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B), which shall not be
required to include footnotes (and Purchaser hereby acknowledges receipt of
the financial statements described in clauses (A) (other than the
parenthetical therein) and (B)(x) and acknowledges that financial statements
required pursuant to clause (B)(y) shall satisfy such requirement if they are
in the form of those previously provided in satisfaction of clause (B)(x)) and
(C) any customary information regarding the Business necessary for Purchaser
to prepare the pro forma financial information required by Section (f)(iv) of
Exhibit D to the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect as of the date hereof,

than information that is either publicly available (or could be derived from
publicly available information) or not material with respect to the Seller or
any of its securities, for purposes of United States federal and state
securities laws), (vi) using reasonable best efforts to facilitate customary

Affiliates shall be required to take or permit the taking of any action
pursuant to this _Section 5.8_ that would: (1) require Seller, its Affiliates

are officers or directors of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any
Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries) to pass resolutions or consents to

breach of, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both)
under, any contract to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party, (9)
require Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their Representatives
to provide access to or disclose information that Seller or any of its
Affiliates determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or other
applicable legal privilege of Seller or any of its Affiliates, _provided_
that, in the event that the restrictions set forth in this clause (9) apply,
Seller shall cooperate in good faith to attempt to design and
implement alternative disclosure arrangements to enable Purchaser to evaluate
any such information without jeopardizing the attorney-client or other
applicable legal privilege, (10) require Seller or any of its Affiliates or
any of their Representatives to prepare any pro forma financial statements or
to provide any information or assistance relating to (aa) the proposed
aggregate amount of the Financing, assumed interest rates, dividends (other
than those declared or paid prior to the Closing) and fees and
expenses relating to the incurrence of the Financing, (bb) any post-Closing
or pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other
post-Closing pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any
information used in connection with the Debt Financing or (cc) any financial
information related to Purchaser or (11) unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of Seller or any of its Affiliates. Nothing contained in
this _Section 5.8_ or otherwise shall require Seller or any of its
Affiliates, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with
respect to the Debt Financing. Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by
Seller, reimburse Seller for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by
Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives in
connection with such cooperation and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the arrangement of the Financing, any action taken by them at the request of
Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 5.8 _and any information used in
connection therewith (other than information provided in writing by Seller or
its Affiliates or their Representatives specifically in connection with its
obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.8_).

(b)  For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the provisions contained in this _Section 5.8_ represent the
sole obligation of Seller, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives
with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any
financing (including the Financing) to be obtained by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and no other provision of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto) shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations.

  



  

(c)  All information regarding Seller or any of its Affiliates
obtained by Purchaser or its Representatives pursuant to this  _Section 5.8_
shall be kept confidential in accordance with this Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_  that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement,
Purchaser and its Representatives may disclose any information relating to
the Business or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
any Financing Parties (or prospective Financing Parties) or ratings agencies
so long as, in the case of any Financing Parties, such Financing Parties are
subject to the confidentiality undertakings set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter as in effect on the date hereof or other customary confidentiality
undertakings (not materially less favorable to Seller, Purchaser and each of
their respective Affiliates than the confidentiality undertakings set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect as of the date hereof)
with respect to dissemination of such information to such Persons with
respect to debt financings of the type contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter as in effect as of the date hereof or, in the case of any rating
agency, such rating agency is subject to customary confidentiality
undertakings with respect to dissemination of such information to such rating
agency. Seller hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries' logos
in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that such trademarks and
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 5.9   _Financial Obligations_. At or prior to the Closing,
Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to arrange for substitute letters of credit, surety bonds, Purchaser
guarantees, advance payment guarantees, and other obligations issued by or
for the account of Purchaser or its Affiliates to replace the outstanding
letters of credit, surety bonds, guarantees, advance payment guarantees and
other contractual obligations entered into by or on behalf of Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than the Purchased Companies (and Subsidiaries
thereof)) in connection with or relating to the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities (together, the " _Guarantees_ ") and assume
all obligations under each Guarantee, obtaining from the creditor or other
counterparty a full and irrevocable release of Seller and its Affiliates that
are liable, directly or indirectly, for reimbursement to the creditor or
fulfillment of other Liabilities to a counterparty in connection with the
Guarantees. Purchaser further agrees that to the extent Seller or any of its
Affiliates incurs any cost or expense, or is required to make any payment, or
is subject to any claim or Proceeding, in connection with such Guarantees on
or after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and
its Affiliates against, and reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for, any and
all Liabilities or amounts paid, including costs or expenses in connection
with such Guarantees, including Seller's and any of its Affiliates' expenses
in maintaining such Guarantees, whether or not any such Guarantee is drawn
upon or required to be performed, and shall in any event promptly and in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after written demand therefor from
Seller, reimburse Seller and any of its Affiliates to the extent that any
Guarantee is called upon and Seller or any of its Affiliates makes any
payment or incurs any Liability in respect of any such Guarantee. For any
Guarantees for which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, as applicable, is
not substituted in all respects for Seller and its Affiliates (or for which
Seller and its Affiliates are not fully released) effective as of the Closing
and that cannot otherwise be terminated effective as of the Closing (with
Seller and its Affiliates to be fully released in respect thereof), Purchaser
and Seller shall cooperate and shall use their best efforts to and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to continue to use their reasonable best
efforts to effect such substitution or termination and release after the
Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall extend or renew any Contract containing or underlying a
Guarantee unless, prior to or concurrently with such extension or renewal,
Purchaser or its Affiliates are substituted in all respects for Seller and
its Affiliates, and Seller and its Affiliates are fully released, in respect
of all Liabilities under such Guarantees.

  



  

Section 5.10   _IP Matters_.

  



  

(a)  Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including the
Purchased Companies or any of their Subsidiaries) shall acquire any rights
in, or use, or have the right to use, the AECOM Name and AECOM Marks or any
name or mark that, in the reasonable judgment of Seller, is similar to or
embodies the AECOM Name and AECOM Marks. Purchaser shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Closing, cause each of the Purchased
Companies (and Subsidiaries thereof) having a name, Mark or logo that includes
the AECOM Name and AECOM Marks to change its name to a name that does not
include the AECOM Name and AECOM Marks, including making any
Filings necessary to effect such change within thirty (30) days following the
Closing, and shall complete the removal of the AECOM Name and AECOM Marks (a)
within thirty (30) days following the Closing from all websites, social and
mobile media or other digital content in their possession or control and (b)
within six (6) months following the Closing from all products, signage,
vehicles, properties, technical information, stationery and promotional or
other marketing materials and other assets. Seller hereby grants to the
Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries a royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-
exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, limited right and license to
use the AECOM Name and AECOM Marks solely for the above time periods and
purposes. Purchaser agrees that any use of the AECOM Name and AECOM Marks by
any of the Purchased Companies or their Subsidiaries pursuant to such
license will be in a manner consistent with past practice and transitional
"phase out" use and that the Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries will
maintain quality standards at least as high as those in effect as of the
Closing Date with respect to any goods or services provided or delivered
using the AECOM Name and AECOM Marks and shall cease to hold themselves out as
having any affiliation with Seller or its Subsidiaries from and after the
Closing.

(b)  Seller and its applicable Subsidiaries hereby grant to
Purchaser and the Purchased Entities (and their Subsidiaries), effective as
of the Closing, a perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, non-
sublicensable, non-assignable, limited, personal license to use the
Intellectual Property (excluding the AECOM Name and AECOM Marks and any other
Marks and excluding any Business Intellectual Property) used or held for use
in the Retained Businesses and that Purchaser can demonstrate was used by
Seller or its Subsidiaries (including the Purchased Entities and their
Subsidiaries) in operating the Business during the twelve (12)-month period
prior to the Closing (the " _Seller Licensed Intellectual Property_ ") solely
to the extent and in the manner as such Seller Licensed Intellectual Property
was used in the operation of the Business during such twelve (12)-month
period. The Seller Licensed Intellectual Property shall be licensed on an
"as-is, where-is" basis without any representation or warranty whatsoever,
and all implied warranties are hereby disclaimed by Seller and its
Subsidiaries. Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, and
following the Closing, the Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries,
acknowledges that except as may be expressly provided in the Transition
Services Agreement, Seller and its Subsidiaries are not obligated to furnish
or make available to Purchaser or the Purchased Companies or their
Subsidiaries any updates to the Seller Licensed Intellectual Property or any
technical information or support of any kind. Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that nothing in this _Section 5.10(b)_ shall constitute a transfer of
ownership of any Intellectual Property from Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing,
the Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries).

  



  

(c)  Purchaser hereby grants, and as of the Closing will cause
the applicable Purchased Entities (and their Subsidiaries) to grant,
effective as of the Closing, a perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-
exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, limited, personal license to
use the Business Intellectual Property that Seller can demonstrate was used by
Seller or its Subsidiaries in operating the Retained Businesses during the
twelve (12)-month period prior to the Closing (the " _Purchaser
Licensed Intellectual Property_ ") solely to the extent and in the manner as
such Purchaser Licensed Intellectual Property was used in the operation of
the Retained Businesses during such twelve (12)-month period. The Purchaser
Licensed Intellectual Property shall be licensed on an "as-is, where-is"
basis without any representation or warranty whatsoever, and all
implied warranties are hereby disclaimed by Purchaser. Seller and its
Subsidiaries acknowledge that except as may be expressly provided in the
Transition Services Agreement, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the
Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries) are not obligated to furnish or
make available to Seller or its Subsidiaries any updates to the Purchaser
Licensed Intellectual Property or any technical information or support of any
kind. Seller acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this _Section
5.10(c)_ shall constitute a transfer of ownership of any Business
Intellectual Property from Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing, the Purchased Entities and their
Subsidiaries) to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 5.11   _Insurance_.

  



  

(a)  From and after the Closing, the Business, the Purchased
Companies, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, and the operations
and assets and Liabilities in respect thereof, shall cease to be insured by
Seller's or its Affiliates' insurance policies or by any of their self-
insured programs (other than the Business Insurance Policies), and neither
Purchaser nor its Affiliates (including the Business and the Purchased
Companies and their Subsidiaries) shall have any access, right, title or
interest to or in any such insurance policies (including to all claims and
rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds) to cover the Business, the
Purchased Companies, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, or the
operations or assets or Liabilities in respect thereof (other than the
Business Insurance Policies). Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the
Closing, with respect to events or circumstances to the extent relating to
the Business, the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities that occurred
or existed prior to the Closing that are covered by third-party occurrence-
based insurance policies of Seller or its Affiliates (the  " _Seller
Insurance Policies_ "), Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser to submit any
claims under the Seller Insurance Policies solely to the extent such coverage
is available under the Seller Insurance Policies and Purchaser elects to
submit such claims. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall be entitled
to any proceeds arising out of any such claim, and Seller and
its Subsidiaries shall cause any such proceeds to be paid or remitted to
Purchaser or its designee, whether by delivering notices or other instruments
to the applicable insurers that Purchaser or its designee is the payee with
respect to the applicable claim, remitting such proceeds directly to
Purchaser or its designee upon receipt by Seller or its applicable Subsidiary,
entering into escrow, trust or security arrangements with respect to such
proceeds (or anticipated proceeds), or otherwise. Purchaser shall
indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse Seller or its applicable Affiliates
for any deductibles, self-insured retention, fees, indemnity
payments, settlements, judgments, legal fees, allocated claims expenses and
claim handling fees and other costs or expenses (including any increased
costs or premiums incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates) as a result of
any such claims or Purchaser's access to such Seller Insurance Policies
following the Closing. Seller or its Affiliates may amend any insurance
policies in the manner that Seller or its Affiliates deem appropriate to give
effect to this _Section 5.11_. Except as expressly provided in this _Section
5.11_, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for securing
all insurance it considers appropriate for the Business, the Purchased
Companies, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, and the operations
and assets and Liabilities in respect thereof, including maintenance of
project-specific insurance policies. Except as expressly set forth in this
_Section 5.11_, Purchaser further covenants and agrees not to seek to assert
or to exercise any rights or claims of, or in respect of, the Business, the
Purchased Companies, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, and the
operations and assets and Liabilities in respect thereof, under or in respect
of any past or current insurance policy under which any of the foregoing is a
named insured (other than the Business Insurance Policies).

(b)  To the extent Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries,
including any Purchased Entity (or Subsidiary thereof) is the named insured
with respect to any Excluded Insurance Policy or any Excluded Insurance Policy
is held in the name of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, including any
Purchased Entity (or any Subsidiary thereof), following the Closing, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause the Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries to,
submit claims related to, arising out of or resulting from any
Retained Liabilities under any such Excluded Insurance Policies as directed
by Seller in Seller's sole discretion. Seller shall indemnify, hold harmless
and reimburse Purchaser or its applicable Affiliates for any deductibles,
self-insured retention, fees, settlements, judgments, legal fees, allocated
claims expenses and claim handling fees and other costs or expenses as a
result of submitting any such claims following the Closing. Seller shall have
full control over the management of any such submitted claim and shall be
entitled to settle, compromise or otherwise resolve any such claim in its sole
discretion. Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, including the Purchased Entities
(and their Subsidiaries), shall cooperate with Seller and its counsel in
pursuing any such claim. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be entitled
to any proceeds arising out of any such claim, and Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries, including the Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries, shall
cause any such proceeds to be paid or remitted to Seller or its designee,
whether by delivering notices or other instruments to the applicable insurers
that Seller or its designee is the payee with respect to the applicable
Excluded Insurance Policy or claim, remitting such proceeds directly to Seller
or its designee upon receipt by Purchaser or its applicable Subsidiary,
entering into escrow, trust or security arrangements with respect to such
proceeds (or anticipated proceeds), or otherwise. Purchaser and Seller shall
cooperate in good faith and use their respective reasonable best efforts
between the date hereof and the Closing to enter into one or more customary
litigation management agreements reasonably acceptable to both Parties to
implement the provisions of this _Section 5.11(b)_; _provided_ , that Seller
will manage and control and retain responsibility for any Proceedings
relating to claims made under Excluded Insurance Policies pursuant to this
_Section 5.11(b)_, and will indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates for any
legal fees, losses or other costs or expenses incurred by Purchaser or any
such Affiliate arising from, or relating to, such Proceedings, and neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to advance expenses to
or on behalf of, Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with any such
Proceeding. Except as set forth in this _Section 5.11_, Purchaser shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Purchased Entities and their
Subsidiaries) not to, submit any claim or seek any recovery under the Excluded
Insurance Policies.

  



  

Section 5.12   _Litigation Support_. Subject to the provisions of
_Article X_ (including _Section 10.4_), in the event that and for so long
as Seller or any of its Affiliates is prosecuting, contesting or defending any
Proceeding, investigation, charge, claim or demand by or against a third
party (for the avoidance of doubt, other than Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates) in connection with (a) the Transaction or any of the other
transactions contemplated under this Agreement, or (b) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction relating to, in connection
with or arising from the Business, the Purchased Companies, the Purchased
Assets, the Retained Liabilities or the Assumed Liabilities, Purchaser shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries (and its and their officers and employees)
to, at the reasonable written request of Seller, cooperate with Seller and its
counsel in such prosecution, contest or defense, including making available
its personnel, and providing such testimony and access to its books and
records and other information as shall be reasonably necessary in connection
with such prosecution, contest or defense; _provided_ that (x) such
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the Business
and (y) Seller reimburses Purchaser and its Affiliates for any out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, any internal costs,
including employee costs) incurred in connection with such cooperation.
Subject to the provisions of _Article X_ (including _Section 10.4_), in the
event that and for so long as Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries is
prosecuting, contesting or defending any Proceeding, investigation, charge,
claim or demand by or against a third party (for the avoidance of doubt, other
than Seller or any of its Affiliates) in connection with (a) the Transaction
or any of the other transactions contemplated under this Agreement, or (b)
any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice,
plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction
relating to, in connection with or arising from the Retained Businesses, the
Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities, Seller shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries (and its and their officers and employees) to, at the
reasonable written request of Purchaser and at the sole cost and expense of
Purchaser, cooperate with Purchaser and its counsel in such
prosecution, contest or defense, including making available its personnel,
and providing such testimony and access to its books and records and other
information as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with such
prosecution, contest or defense; provided that such cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the Retained Businesses.

Section 5.13   _Payments_.

  



  

(a)  Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to,
promptly pay or deliver to Purchaser (or its designated Affiliates) any
monies or checks that have been sent to Seller or any of its Affiliates after
the Closing Date by customers, suppliers or other contracting parties of the
Business or the Purchased Companies or their Subsidiaries to the extent that
they constitute a Purchased Asset and are the property of Purchaser
hereunder.

  



  

(b)  Subject to _Section 5.16_, Purchaser shall, or shall cause
its applicable Affiliate to, promptly pay or deliver to Seller (or its
designated Affiliates) any monies or checks that have been sent to Purchaser

and their Subsidiaries) after the Closing Date to the extent that they
constitute an Excluded Asset and are the property of Seller or its Affiliates
hereunder.

  



  

Section 5.14   _Closing Structure_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates, including the Seller Entities, the Purchased
Entities and their respective Subsidiaries, to, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including _Section 2.13 _and _Section 5.1_,
take actions to implement the restructuring steps (the " _Pre-Closing
Restructuring Steps_ ") set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto (including the
closing structure set forth therein (the " _Closing Structure_ ")); 
_provided_ that Seller may modify the Pre-Closing Restructuring Steps and, to
the extent Seller determines to make any such modification, Seller shall
deliver a statement setting forth such modified Pre-Closing Restructuring
Steps to Purchaser as promptly as practicable following any such decision to
modify; _provided_ , further, that Seller shall not modify such Pre-
Closing Restructuring Steps without Purchaser's prior written consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) if such
modification would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Purchaser in any
Post-Closing Tax Period (other than in any _de minimis_ respect and taking
into account Seller's indemnification and payment obligations
hereunder). Seller may modify the Closing Structure from time to time,
subject, in the case of any modification that would have an adverse effect on
Purchaser (other than in any _de minimis_ respect), to the prior written
consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Seller shall deliver a statement setting forth such
modified Closing Structure to Purchaser as promptly as practicable following
any such decision to modify. Purchaser shall have the right to review such
modifications to the Closing Structure and any additional information with
respect to such modifications that Purchaser may reasonably request. In the
event the Closing Structure is so modified, _Section 2.4(a)(i)_ and _Section
2.4(a)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to be
automatically amended to reflect such modifications to the extent applicable.

reasonable best efforts to complete such divestiture as soon as reasonably
practicable;

Section 5.18   _Use of Past Performance_.

  



  

(a)  Seller acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the
Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates, including the Purchased Companies (and
Subsidiaries thereof), may make factual statements that truthfully and
reasonably reference the Business's past performance in support of future
bids and solicitations, as permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the
relevant solicitation, and to the extent that such past performance of the
Business was conducted by Seller and its Affiliates, such reference may refer
to Seller and its Affiliates. However, Seller and its Affiliates make no
representation or warranty regarding whether a soliciting body or customer
will accept and/or favorably consider or evaluate such past performance.
Purchaser and the Purchased Companies (and their Subsidiaries) acknowledge
and agree that no such references may be made in respect of work outside the
scope of the Business.

  



  

(b)  Purchaser and the Purchased Companies and their
Subsidiaries acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing,
Seller and its Affiliates and their successors in interest may make factual
statements that truthfully and reasonably reference the past performance of
the Purchased Companies (and their Subsidiaries) in connection with activities
that Seller is not prohibited from undertaking pursuant to _Section 5.15(c)_
in support of future bids and solicitations, as permitted by applicable
Law and the terms of the relevant solicitation, and to the extent that such
past performance of the Business was conducted by the Purchased Companies or
their Subsidiaries, such reference may refer to the Purchased Companies or
their Subsidiaries. However, Purchaser and its Affiliates make no
representation or warranty regarding whether a soliciting body or customer
will accept and/or favorably consider or evaluate such past performance.
Seller and its Affiliates acknowledge and agree that no such references may be
made in support of activities that Seller and its Affiliates are prohibited
from undertaking pursuant to _Section 5.15(c)_.

  



  

Section 5.19   _Transition Services; Real Estate Transition; Systems
Separation_. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith and use their
respective reasonable best efforts, between the date hereof and the Closing,
(a) to agree on the final terms of a transition services agreement consistent
with the general terms set forth on _Exhibit C_ , to be entered into at the
Closing (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ "); (b) to implement, at
Seller's sole cost and expense with respect to any such separation, but not,
for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any rental payment obligations
from and after the Closing, the real estate separation plan in the manner set
forth in _Section 5.19(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (the " _Real
Estate Separation_ "); and (c) to agree on a separation plan for the systems,
including data migration, set forth on _Section 5.19(c)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules (the " _Systems Separation_ "), and thereafter to use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Systems Separation to be effectuated

shall cooperate in good faith between the date hereof and the Closing to agree
on any reasonably requested modifications to _Section 5.19(b)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules that are reasonably necessary to effectuate the Real
Estate Separation or would not have an adverse effect (other than in any _de
minimis_ respect) on Purchaser. In the event that any Systems Separation is
not effectuated prior to the Closing, Seller agrees that any services required
to be provided by Seller and its Subsidiaries to effect such Systems
Separation in all material respects in accordance with the
applicable separation plan shall be added to the Transition Services

Article VI

  

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

  



  

Section 6.1   _Transfer of Business Employees_.

  



  

(a)   _Transfer of Business Employees Generally_. On or prior to
the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to (i) transfer the employment of each Business Employee to a
Purchased Entity (or a Subsidiary thereof) and (ii) transfer the employment
of each employee who is not a Business Employee from a Purchased Entity (or a
Subsidiary thereof) to Seller or one of its Affiliates (other than a
Purchased Company or a Subsidiary thereof). Seller shall update the
employee census previously made available to Purchaser to be accurate as of
two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and shall provide Purchaser
with a further updated employee census on the day prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) _TUD Employees_. With respect to each Business Employee who
is not employed by a Purchased Entity (or a Subsidiary thereof) and is
employed in a jurisdiction in which the Transfer of Undertakings Directive has
been implemented (a  " _TUD Employee_ "), to the extent such Laws are
applicable, Seller and Purchaser accept and agree that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement constitute a relevant transfer for purposes of
the Transfer of Undertakings Directive and to apply the Transfer of
Undertakings Directive in all of its provisions, and accept and agree that
such TUD Employee will transfer effective as of the Closing to a Purchased
Entity (or a Subsidiary thereof). Seller and Purchaser shall inform and
consult with any appropriate representatives of the TUD Employees to the
extent required by the Transfer of Undertakings Directive or other applicable
Law.

  



  

(c)   _Offers to Certain Business Employees_. Subject to
_Sections 6.1(d)_ and _6.1(e)_ , no later than ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries
to, make a written offer of employment, on terms and conditions consistent
with the requirements of this _Article VI_ and applicable Law, to
each Business Employee who is not employed by a Purchased Entity (or a
Subsidiary thereof) and does not become a Transferred Employee pursuant to
_Section 6.1(b)_ (an " _Offer Employee_ "). Effective as of the Closing,
Seller and its Affiliates shall cease to employ any Offer Employee other than
any Employee on Leave (whose employment has not previously terminated, as
determined based on the leave of absence policies applicable to Business
Employees as of prior to the Closing Date) and any Delayed Transfer Employee.

  



  

(d)   _Delayed Transfer Employees_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the case of any Business Employee whose employment with
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries is delayed due to legal requirements in the
applicable jurisdiction (a " _Delayed Transfer Employee_ "), Seller and
Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to cause the employment of such
Delayed Transfer Employee to transfer as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing in such a manner that to the maximum extent possible
does not trigger the right of the employee to separation pay. Prior to such
transfer, the Parties shall reasonably cooperate to provide for the services
of such Business Employee to be made available exclusively to Purchaser
through an employee secondment, services or similar arrangement. Any such
Delayed Transfer Employee shall transfer and be employed pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this _Article VI_ and applicable Law and, from and after
transfer of employment to Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Purchased Entities), shall be considered a Transferred Employee for purposes
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the transfer of Liabilities contemplated by this _Article VI_ related to
Delayed Transfer Employees shall be delayed and shall only be effective as of
a date coincident with or as soon as practicable following the transfer of a
Delayed Transfer Employee to Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, with the
references to "Closing" or "Closing Date" in this _Article VI_ (other than
for purposes of _Section 6.2(a)_) to be the date of transfer of employment
or such other date as agreed by the Parties.

  



  

   

-96-

 



    



  

(e)   _Employees on Leave_. If any Business Employee or Former
Business Employee who is an Employee on Leave as of the Closing Date and is
not an employee of a Purchased Entity or one of its Subsidiaries (as
determined based on the leave of absence policies applicable to Business
Employees as of prior to the Closing Date), within twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date, presents himself or herself for active employment
and is able to return to work, Purchaser shall offer employment to such
employee on terms consistent with those applicable to Business Employees
generally under this _Article VI_, with the last sentence of _Section
6.1(d)_ to apply to such employee _mutatis mutandis_. To the extent required
by the terms of any Collective Bargaining Agreement or applicable Law,
Purchaser shall allow to return to active employment any Employee on Leave who
is subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement, but who subsequently
presents himself or herself for active employment and is able to return to
work within the period provided in the Collective Bargaining Agreement that
applied to him or her immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(f)   _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) any
U.S. Business Employee whose employment transfers pursuant to this _Section
6.1_ shall be referred to as a " _U.S. Transferred Employee_ ," and (ii) any
International Business Employee whose employment transfers pursuant to this
_Section 6.1_ shall be referred to as an " _International Transferred
Employee_ " (collectively, the " _Transferred Employees_ ").

  



  

Section 6.2   _Compensation and Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a)   _Compensation and Benefits Comparability_. For a period of
one (1) year following the Closing, or such longer period as required by
applicable Law, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to
each Business Employee (other than any Business Employee who is covered by a
Collective Bargaining Agreement) during his or her employment with Purchaser
and its Affiliates (i) base salary or wage rates that are not less than those
in effect for each such Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing,
(ii) equity and short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities at target
level that, in each case, are no less favorable than those in effect for each
such Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing (excluding for
this purpose any one-time or otherwise special or non-ordinary course
incentive compensation opportunities) (it being understood that in lieu of
equity compensation awards to those Business Employees who as of immediately
prior to the Closing were eligible for Seller equity compensation awards,
Purchaser may (A) provide long-term incentive awards that are settled in cash
or (B) increase the base salary and/or short-term cash incentive compensation
opportunity, in either case, in an amount sufficient to replace the grant
date value of the Business Employee's equity compensation opportunity prior to
the Closing), (iii) employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to those in effect for each such Business Employee
immediately prior to the Closing, and (iv) subject to any applicable release
of claims requirements, severance benefits that are no less favorable than
the severance benefits that would have been payable to each such Business
Employee under the Seller Benefit Plan in which such Business Employee
participated, or was eligible for, immediately prior to the Closing, as set
forth on _Section 6.2(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, taking into
account such Business Employee's additional period of service and
increases (but not decreases) in compensation following the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms and conditions of employment for any
Transferred Employees who are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement
shall be governed by such Collective Bargaining Agreement.

  



  

   

-97-

 



    



  

(b)   _German Severance or Other Termination Liabilities_.
Seller and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for any severance,
termination indemnity, redundancy or similar termination payments or benefits
required by applicable Law that may become payable to any Business Employee
located in Germany and employed by AECOM Deutschland GmbH on the date hereof
because such Business Employee (i) rejects or does not accept an offer of
employment or transfer of employment that complies with this _Article
VI_, (ii) refuses to transfer employment or otherwise challenges such
transfer of employment pursuant to _Section 6.1_ or (iii) transfers
employment to Purchaser and its Affiliates but is nonetheless owed any such
payments or benefits solely as a result of such transfer. To the extent that
Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Purchased Companies and their
Subsidiaries) become liable for, or are legally required to make, severance,
redundancy, termination indemnity or other termination
payments, contributions or benefits to any Business Employee pursuant to this
_Section 6.2(b)_, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, reimburse
Purchaser, as soon as practicable but in any event within thirty (30) days of
receipt from Purchaser of an invoice, for all payments, costs and expenses
actually paid by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Purchased
Companies and their Subsidiaries) to the Business Employees, including any
employment, social security or other Taxes or any employer contributions, in
each case, to the extent that such amounts are required by applicable Law to
be paid. Any such reimbursement payment hereunder shall be treated as a
Covered Loss for purposes of _Section 7.4_ and Purchaser shall be treated as
the indemnified party thereunder.

  



  

(c)   _Service Credit_. For all purposes (including purposes of
vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee
benefit plans of Purchaser and its Affiliates providing benefits to any
Business Employees after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), each Business
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with Seller
and its Affiliates and their respective predecessors prior to the Closing, to
the same extent as such Business Employee was entitled, prior to the Closing,
to credit for such service under any similar Seller Benefit Plan in which such
Business Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Closing; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply for
purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or
employer-subsidy under a post-employment medical plan (except with respect to
any Purchased Entity Benefit Plan or as otherwise required by applicable Law)
or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits for the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that each Business Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans
that are welfare benefit plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
comparable to a Seller Benefit Plan in which such Business Employee
participated immediately before the Closing (such plans, collectively, the "
_Old Plans_ ").

  



  

   

-98-

 



    



  

(d)   _Welfare Plans_.

  



  

(i)  Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall be responsible
for all Liabilities related to welfare benefit claims under the Purchased
Entity Benefit Plans. Seller or one of its Affiliates (other than any
Purchased Company or Subsidiary thereof) shall be responsible for all
Liabilities related to welfare benefit claims incurred under any Seller
Benefit Plan that is not a Purchased Entity Benefit Plan. For the avoidance
of doubt, any Former Business Employee who has experienced a qualifying event
under U.S. Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
codified at Section 601 _et seq_. of ERISA and at Section 4980B of the Code
(" _COBRA_ ") and his or her eligible dependents who are receiving (or timely
elect to receive), whether prior to, on or after the Closing Date, benefits
pursuant to COBRA under a Seller Benefit Plan that is not a Purchased Entity
Benefit Plan shall be permitted to continue receiving benefits pursuant to
COBRA under such Seller Benefit Plan following the Closing Date.

  



  

(ii)  For purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Business Employee, Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived
for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions
would not have been waived under the comparable Seller Benefit Plans in which
such employee participated immediately prior to the Closing, and Purchaser
shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans
ending on the date such employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

  



  

(e)   _Flexible Spending Accounts_. Seller and Purchaser shall
take all actions necessary or appropriate so that, effective as of the
Closing Date, (i) the account balances (whether positive or negative) (the "
_Transferred FSA Balances_ ") under the applicable flexible spending plan of
Seller or its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller FSA Plan_ ") of the
Transferred Employees who are participants in the Seller FSA Plan shall be
transferred to one or more comparable plans of Purchaser (collectively, the "
_Purchaser FSA Plan_ "); (ii) the elections, contribution levels and
coverage levels of such Transferred Employees shall apply under the Purchaser
FSA Plan in the same manner as under the Seller FSA Plan; and (iii) such
Transferred Employees shall be reimbursed from the Purchaser FSA Plan for
claims incurred at any time during the plan year of the Seller FSA Plan in
which the Closing Date occurs that are submitted to the Purchaser FSA Plan
from and after the Closing Date on the same basis and the same terms and
conditions as under the Seller FSA Plan. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the amount
of the Transferred FSA Balances is determined, Seller shall pay Purchaser the
net aggregate amount of the Transferred FSA Balances, if such amount is
positive, and Purchaser shall pay Seller the net aggregate amount of the
Transferred FSA Balances, if such amount is negative.

  



  

   

-99-

 



    



  

(f)   _Accrued Vacation, Sick Leave and Paid Time Off_.
Purchaser will recognize and assume all Liability with respect to accrued but
unused vacation, sick leave and paid time off for all Business Employees to
the extent included as a current liability in Closing Working Capital as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)_. Purchaser shall promptly
(and in any event, within ten (10) Business Days following the later of the
determination of Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.9(d)_ and the date of the applicable payment) reimburse Seller for
any payments made by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Purchased
Companies and their Subsidiaries) to any Transferred Employees in respect of
earned but unused vacation, sick leave and paid time off that become due as a
result of the transfer of employment, to the extent included as a current
liability in Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.9(d)_. Purchaser shall allow Transferred Employees to use the
vacation, sick leave and paid time off recognized or established in accordance
with the first sentence of this _Section 6.2(f)_ in accordance with the
terms of Seller's and its applicable Affiliates' programs in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 6.3   _Seller Benefit Plans_. Except as set forth in
_Section 6.7_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, from and after the Closing
(or, if later, the date a Delayed Transfer Employee's employment transfers to
Purchaser or its Affiliates), the Transferred Employees shall cease to be
active participants in the Seller Benefit Plans that are not Purchased Entity
Benefit Plans. Unless specifically provided for in this _Article VI_,
Purchaser shall not assume any obligations under or Liabilities with respect
to any Seller Benefit Plan that is not a Purchased Entity Benefit Plan and
Seller shall remain solely responsible for and shall indemnify and hold
harmless Purchaser for any and all Liabilities under, in connection with or
relating to any such Seller Benefit Plan.

  



  

Section 6.4   _Purchased Entity Benefit Plans_. Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall assume, and Seller and its Affiliates shall transfer to
Purchaser and its Affiliates, all assets (if any) and Liabilities related to
all Purchased Entity Benefit Plans. To the extent a Purchased Entity Benefit
Plan is not required to be funded by applicable Law and is not funded, there
shall be no transfer of assets from Seller or its Affiliates. Except as
otherwise explicitly provided in this Agreement, Purchaser shall indemnify
and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their officers, directors,
employees, and agents from and against any and all costs, damages, losses,
expenses, or other Liabilities arising out of or related to the Purchased
Entity Benefits Plans. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause all employees
of Seller and its Affiliates who are not Business Employees to cease to be
active participants in any Purchased Entity Benefit Plans with respect to
service following the Closing Date.

  



  

   

-100-

 



    



  

Section 6.5   _U.S. Defined Contribution Plans_.

  



  

(a)  As soon as practicable following the Closing, Purchaser
shall create or designate defined contribution plans (collectively, the "
_Purchaser DC Plans_ ") for the benefit of the U.S. Transferred Employees who
participated in one or more of the defined contribution plans maintained by
Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Purchased Companies and their
Subsidiaries) that are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code immediately prior to the Closing (collectively, the " _Seller DC Plans_
"). Such U.S. Transferred Employees are referred to hereinafter as the " _U.S.
DC Employees_." The U.S. DC Employees shall be given credit under the
respective Purchaser DC Plan for all service with Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective predecessors as if it were service with
Purchaser for purposes of determining eligibility and vesting and the level
of benefits under each respective Purchaser DC Plan. The applicable Purchaser
DC Plans shall be intended to be tax-qualified in the same manner as the
corresponding Seller DC Plans.

  



  

(b)  Each Purchaser DC Plan will provide for the receipt from
the U.S. DC Employees of "eligible rollover distributions" (as such term is
defined under Section 402 of the Code), including notes corresponding to
loans. Purchaser and Seller will work together in order to facilitate any
such distribution or rollover and to effect an eligible rollover distribution
for those U.S. DC Employees who elect to roll over their account balances,
including notes, directly into a Purchaser DC Plan.

  



  

Section 6.6   _Deferred Compensation Plans_.

  



  

(a)  Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall establish or
designate nonqualified deferred compensation plans (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Deferred Compensation Plans_ ") for the benefit of the Transferred
Employees who participated in one or more of the nonqualified deferred
compensation plans maintained by Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries) immediately prior to the Closing
(collectively, the " _Seller Deferred Compensation Plans_ "). Such
Transferred Employees are referred to hereinafter as the " _Deferred
Compensation Employees_." The Deferred Compensation Employees shall be given
credit under the respective Purchaser Deferred Compensation Plan for all
service with Seller and its Affiliates and their respective predecessors as
if it were service with Purchaser for purposes of determining
eligibility, vesting and the amount of any benefits or benefit accruals under
each respective Purchaser Deferred Compensation Plan.

  



  

(b)  From and after the Closing, Purchaser and the Purchaser
Deferred Compensation Plans shall assume all Liabilities with respect to or
relating to Deferred Compensation Employees under the applicable Seller
Deferred Compensation Plan, and Seller and its Affiliates and the Seller
Deferred Compensation Plans shall be relieved of all such Liabilities under
such Seller Deferred Compensation Plans with respect to the Deferred
Compensation Employees. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify
and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their officers, directors,
employees, and agents from and against any and all costs, damages, losses,
expenses, or other Liabilities arising out of or related to the Deferred
Compensation Employees under the applicable Seller Deferred
Compensation Plans.

  



  

Section 6.7   _Scheduled Benefits Matters_. Seller and Purchaser
agree to take the actions described in Section 6.7 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules.

  



  

   

-101-

 



    



  

Section 6.8   _Short-Term Incentive Compensation; Change in Control
Payments_.

  



  

(a)  Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, assume
all obligations to pay any cash incentive compensation payable under each
annual incentive compensation plan or arrangement in which any Transferred
Employee participates in respect of the fiscal year in which the Closing
occurs (or any portion thereof) to Transferred Employees in connection with
their services to the Business (the " _Cash Incentive Compensation_ ") to the
extent included as a current liability in Closing Working Capital as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)_ and Seller and its Affiliates shall
not have any obligation to pay such Cash Incentive Compensation. To the
extent any such cash incentive compensation with respect to the fiscal year
ending September 30, 2019 has not been paid in full to all Transferred
Employees, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, pay such
Cash Incentive Compensation to the applicable Transferred Employees, in an
amount determined by Seller to the extent included as a current liability in
Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)_.
All Cash Incentive Compensation with respect to the 2020 fiscal year shall be
governed by plans, programs or arrangements maintained by Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries) on terms
and conditions substantially comparable to those that applied to each such
Transferred Employee prior to the Closing Date, including with respect to
target incentive opportunities and applicable performance metrics in respect
of the Business. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
the aggregate amount of Cash Incentive Compensation with respect to the 2019
fiscal year and the 2020 fiscal year, as applicable, that is actually paid by
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities and their
Subsidiaries) to Transferred Employees (less any Taxes required to be
withheld) shall be not less than the accrued amount of Cash Incentive
Compensation included in Closing Working Capital in respect of the applicable
fiscal year (or portion thereof in the case of the 2020 fiscal year), as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)_.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller shall retain all Liability for the payment or accelerated vesting of
any compensation or benefit that arises solely ( _i.e._ , "single-trigger")
due to the Transaction or other transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Completion Bonuses, but excluding the Change in Control Severance
Agreements set forth in _Section 3.19(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules), including any obligation to make such payments and the employer
portion of any Taxes in respect of any such payments.

  



  

Section 6.9   _Labor Matters_. Purchaser and Seller shall, and
shall cause their Affiliates to, cooperate to take all steps, on a timely
basis, as are required under applicable Law or any Collective Bargaining
Agreement to notify, consult with, or negotiate the effect, impact, terms or
timing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with each works
council, union, labor board, employee group, or Governmental Entity (with
respect to labor and similar matters) where so required under applicable Law,
including the Transfer of Undertakings Directive. Seller shall regularly
review with Purchaser the progress of the notifications, consultations and
negotiations with each works council, union, labor board, employee group and
such Governmental Entity regarding the effect, impact or timing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser and Seller shall, and
shall cause their applicable Affiliates to, comply with all applicable Laws,
directives and regulations relating to the Business Employees. Subject to
receipt of any necessary consents (which Purchaser and Seller shall use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain), Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate

respect to any Business Employee or Former Business Employee is covered by an
insured arrangement, Purchaser's obligation shall be in accordance with
_Section 5.11_ of this Agreement but with respect to any such claims relating

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

  



  

Section 7.1   _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_.

  



  

(a)  Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide to the other Party such cooperation, documentation and
information relating to the Purchased Companies or their Subsidiaries or the
Purchased Assets as either of them may reasonably request in (i) filing any
Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining a
liability for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes, or (iii) conducting any
Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation and information shall include providing
necessary powers of attorney, copies of all relevant portions of relevant Tax
Returns, together with all relevant portions of relevant accompanying
schedules and relevant work papers, relevant documents relating to rulings or
other determinations by Taxing Authorities and relevant records concerning
the ownership and Tax basis of property and other information, which any such
Party may possess. Each Party shall make its employees reasonably available
on a mutually convenient basis at its cost to provide an explanation of any
documents or information so provided.

  



  

(b)  Each Party shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers, and all material records and other documents relating to Tax matters,
of the relevant entities for their respective Tax periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date until the later of (x) the expiration of the statute of
limitations for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents
relate, or (y) eight (8) years following the due date (without extension) for
such Tax Returns. Thereafter, the Party holding such Tax Returns or other
documents may dispose of them after offering the other Party reasonable notice
and opportunity to take possession of such Tax Returns and other documents at
such other Party's own expense.

  



  

Section 7.2   _Allocation of Taxes_. To apportion any Taxes (other
than Transfer Taxes payable in connection with the transactions contemplated

the Purchased Entities (or Subsidiaries thereof) for a Straddle Period: (i)
property Taxes and other Taxes similarly imposed on a periodic basis for the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be equal to
the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle
Period that are on or before the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire Straddle Period and (ii) all other Taxes
(including income, capital gains and similar Taxes) for the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be computed (x) as if such
taxable period ended as of the close of the books on the close of business on
the Closing Date and (y) in the case of any such Taxes attributable to the
ownership of any equity interests in a partnership, other "flowthrough"
entity or " controlled foreign corporation" within the meaning of Section 957
of the Code, as if the taxable period of that entity ended as of the close of
business on the Closing Date.

  



  

   

-104-

 



    



  

Section 7.3   _Tax Returns_.

  



  

(a)  Seller shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) (i) any
Combined Tax Return and (ii) all Tax Returns (other than any Combined Tax
Return) that is required to be filed by or with respect to any of the
Purchased Entities (or any Subsidiaries thereof) for any taxable period that
ends on or before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return_
"). Seller shall timely file (or cause to be filed), taking into account
valid extensions, all such Tax Returns and, to the extent such Tax Returns
are due (taking into account applicable extensions) on or prior to the Closing
Date, pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes shown due on such Tax Returns. All
such Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice of or with respect to the applicable Purchased Entity (or
Subsidiary thereof), except as required by applicable Law. With respect to
any Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return that is required to be filed after the
Closing Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser with a copy of such completed
Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return and a statement certifying the amount of Taxes
shown due on such Tax Return that Seller contends are Retained Liabilities,
not less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date on which such Tax Return
is due (taking validly obtained extensions into account) (or if such Tax
Return is due within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, then as soon as
reasonably practicable taking into account the Tax period and the nature of
the relevant Tax Return or other relevant circumstances). Purchaser shall
have the right to review, comment on and propose changes to such Pre-
Closing Separate Tax Returns and shall provide comments, if any, to Seller on
any such Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return within ten (10) days after receipt
of such Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return (or such shorter period as is
reasonable taking into account the Tax period and the nature of the relevant
Tax Return or other relevant circumstances) and Seller shall consider any such
comments in good faith. Seller shall revise such Pre-Closing Separate Tax
Returns to reflect any comments received from Purchaser which
Seller considered in good faith and with which Seller agrees and shall
deliver, if applicable, a revised Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return to
Purchaser at least ten (10) days before the due date therefor (taking validly
obtained extensions into account) (or such shorter period as is reasonable
taking into account the Tax period and the nature of the relevant Tax Return
or other relevant circumstances), and Purchaser shall timely file or cause to
be timely filed such Tax Returns. Seller shall pay (or cause to be paid) to
Purchaser not less than five (5) days prior to the due date on which such Tax
Return is due (taking validly obtained extensions into account) (or such
shorter period as is reasonable taking into account the Tax period and the
nature of the relevant Tax Return or other relevant circumstances) an amount
equal to any Taxes shown as due thereon for which Seller is liable under
_Article X_. Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Law), Purchaser shall not amend
or revoke any Combined Tax Return or any Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns (or
any notification or election relating thereto) without the prior written
consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). At Seller's reasonable request, Purchaser shall file, or cause
to be filed, amended Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns; _provided_ , _however_
, that Purchaser shall have the same rights to review and comment on such
amended Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns as described in this paragraph
for the original Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns and shall not be required
to file or cause to be filed any such amended Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return
that reflects a position for which Purchaser's confidence level is less than
"more likely than not" (or an equivalent standard under an applicable foreign
Law). Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide (or
cause to be provided) to Seller any information reasonably requested by Seller
to facilitate the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns described in this
_Section 7.3(a)_, and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
prepare (or cause to be prepared) such information in a manner and on a
reasonable timeline requested by Seller, which information and timeline shall
be consistent with the past practice of the Purchased Entities (or
Subsidiaries thereof), as applicable.

  



  

   

-105-

 



    



  

(b)  Except for any Tax Return required to be prepared by Seller
pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_, Purchaser shall prepare (or cause to be
prepared) and timely file, or cause to be filed (taking into account any valid
extensions), all Tax Returns with respect to the Purchased Entities (and any
Subsidiaries thereof). In the case of any such Tax Return for a Straddle
Period (each a " _Purchaser-Filed Tax Return_ "), Purchaser shall prepare (or
cause to be prepared) such Purchaser-Filed Tax Return in a manner consistent
with past practice of or with respect to the applicable Purchased Entity (or
Subsidiary thereof). Purchaser shall provide Seller with a copy of such
completed Purchaser-Filed Tax Return and a statement certifying the amount
of Taxes shown due on such Tax Return that Purchaser contends are Retained
Liabilities, on the one hand, and Assumed Liabilities, on the other hand, not
less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date on which such Tax Return is
due (taking validly obtained extensions into account) (or if such Tax Return
is due within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, then as soon as
reasonably practicable taking into account the Tax period and the nature of
the relevant Tax Return or other relevant circumstances). Seller shall have
the right to review, comment on and propose changes to such Purchaser-Filed
Tax Return and Purchaser shall consider any such comments in good faith.
Purchaser shall revise such Purchaser-Filed Tax Return to reflect any comments
received from Seller which Purchaser considered in good faith and with which
Purchaser agrees and, in the event Purchaser disagrees with any
comments received from Seller, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of such
disagreement prior to the due date for such Purchaser-Filed Tax Return
(taking into account extensions) and Seller and Purchaser shall work together
in good faith to resolve any such disagreements. If Seller and Purchaser are
unable to reach resolution, they shall promptly cause the jointly retained
Independent Accounting Firm (who shall be promptly engaged if not previously
engaged in accordance with _Section 2.9_) to resolve any remaining
disputes within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for
filing such return. Purchaser shall revise such Purchaser-Filed Tax Return to
reflect such resolution and shall deliver, if applicable, a revised Purchaser-
Filed Tax Return to Seller at least ten (10) days before the due date
therefor (taking validly obtained extensions into account) (or such shorter
period as is reasonable taking into account the Tax period and the nature of
the relevant Tax Return or other relevant circumstances), and Purchaser
shall timely file or cause to be timely filed such Tax Return. Seller shall
pay Purchaser not less than five (5) days prior to the due date on which such
Tax Return is due (taking validly obtained extensions into account) (or such
shorter period as is reasonable taking into account the Tax period and the
nature of the relevant Tax Return or other relevant circumstances) an amount
equal to any Taxes shown as due thereon for which Seller is liable under
_Article X_. Any determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
binding upon the parties without further adjustment. The costs, fees and
expenses of such Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by
Purchaser and Seller. Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
analogous provision of state, local or non-U.S. law), Purchaser shall not
amend or revoke any Purchaser-Filed Tax Return (or any notification or
election relating thereto). At Seller's reasonable request, Purchaser shall
file, or cause to be filed, amended Purchaser-Filed Tax Returns; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such amended Purchaser-Filed Tax Return shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with this _Section 7.3(b)_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if a Purchaser-Filed Tax Return is due (taking into account
applicable extensions) before all items with respect to such Purchaser-Filed
Tax Return have been resolved, Purchaser shall timely file (or cause to be
filed) such return as prepared by Purchaser and as revised to reflect any
comments received from Seller which Purchaser considered in good faith
and with which Purchaser agrees. After resolution of all disputed items with
respect to any Purchaser-Filed Tax Return filed prior to such resolution,
Purchaser shall file an amended return reflecting the resolution of such
disputed items, if necessary.

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Seller shall not be required to provide Purchaser or any its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Purchased Entities or any Subsidiaries
thereof) with any Tax Return or copy of any Tax Return of (i) Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than the Purchased Entities and their respective
Subsidiaries) or (ii) a consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary group
that includes Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including any Combined Tax
Return); it being understood that the Tax Returns described in clause (i)
shall not include any Tax Return (or any portion thereof) specifically
identified as a Purchased Asset in _Section 2.4(l)_.

  



  

Section 7.4   _Tax Benefits and Tax Refunds_. The amount of any
Covered Losses for which indemnification is provided under _Article X_ shall
be net of any Tax benefit actually realized by the relevant indemnified party
or any of its Affiliates in the taxable year in which such Covered Loss is
paid or accrued or in the two succeeding taxable years, determined using a
"with and without" methodology. In the event that any such Tax benefit is
actually realized, in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence,
after the relevant indemnification payment is made (such that such
indemnification payment was not reduced by the amount of such Tax benefit),
the indemnified party shall pay to the indemnifying party the amount of such
Tax benefit no later than fifteen (15) days after such Tax benefit is
actually realized. If Purchaser or any of its Affiliates actually realizes any
Tax benefit as a result of any payment of compensation or benefits by Seller
or any of its Affiliates to any Business Employee or Former Business Employee
that is a Retained Liability described in clauses (y) or (z) of _Section
2.7(h)_ in the taxable year in which such payments are made, or in the three
succeeding years, in each case, determined using a "with and
without" methodology, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount of such
Tax benefit no later than fifteen (15) days after such Tax benefit is
actually realized. Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller any
refund (or credit obtained in lieu thereof) of Taxes (a) for which Seller is
liable under _Article X_ or (b) set forth in _Section 7.4_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules (including any interest paid thereon) received by
Purchaser, any Affiliate of Purchaser or the Purchased Entities or any
Subsidiary thereof from a Taxing Authority, except to the extent any such
refund (or credit) is attributable to a carry back of a Tax attribute from a
Post-Closing Tax Period, no later than ten (10) days following receipt of such
refund (or, in the case of a credit obtained in lieu of such refund, no later
than ten (10) days following the filing of the income Tax Return on
which such credit is used to offset tax otherwise payable), net of any out-
of-pocket costs incurred in obtaining such refund or credit (including any
income Taxes imposed thereon); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any
such refund to which Seller has been entitled pursuant to this _Section 7.4_
is subsequently disallowed by a Taxing Authority, Seller shall pay to
Purchaser such amount that has been subsequently disallowed in addition to any
out-of-pocket costs incurred by Purchaser attempting to prevent or contest
such disallowance, no later than ten (10) days prior to the date that such
refund must be paid to the relevant Taxing Authority (taking into account
applicable extensions). Any refunds or credits of the Purchased Entities (or
their Subsidiaries) for any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned
between Seller and Purchaser in accordance with the principles set forth in
_Section 7.2_. Each Party shall pay, or cause its Affiliates to pay, to the
Party entitled to a refund or credit of Taxes under this _Section 7.4_, the
amount of such refund or credit (including any interest paid thereon and
net of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) to the party
receiving such refund or credit in respect of the receipt or accrual of such
refund or credit in readily available funds within fifteen (15) days of the
actual receipt of the refund or credit or the application for such refund or
credit against amounts otherwise payable; _provided, however_ , that to the
extent any such refund is subsequently disallowed by a Taxing Authority, the
Party not responsible for making the payment to the relevant Taxing Authority
shall pay its share of the amount that has been subsequently disallowed in
addition to its share of any out-of-pocket costs incurred by the other Party
attempting to prevent or contest such disallowance, to the other Party, no
later than ten (10) days prior to the date that such refund must be paid to
the relevant Taxing Authority (taking into account applicable extensions).

Section 7.5   _Tax Sharing Agreements_. To the extent relating to
the Purchased Entities or their Subsidiaries, Seller shall terminate or cause
to be terminated, on or before the Closing Date, the rights and obligations of
the Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries pursuant to all Tax sharing
agreements or arrangements (other than this Agreement), if any, to which any
of the Purchased Companies or their Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Purchased Companies and their
Subsidiaries), on the other hand, are parties, and neither Seller nor any of
its Affiliates (other than the Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries), on
the one hand, nor any of the Purchased Entities or their respective
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall have any rights or obligations to each
other after the Closing in respect of such agreements or arrangements.

  



  

Section 7.6   _Tax Contests_.

  



  

(a)  If any Taxing Authority asserts a claim with respect to
Taxes that, if pursued successfully, would reasonably be expected to serve as
the basis for a claim for indemnification under _Article X_ (a " _Tax Claim_
"), then the Party first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall
provide written notice thereof to the other Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that the failure of such Party to give such prompt notice shall not relieve
the other Party of any of its obligations under this _Article VII_, except
to the extent that the other Party is materially and actually prejudiced by
such failure (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction). Such
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and
shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received
from the Taxing Authority.

(b)  In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to any
of the Purchased Entities or their respective Subsidiaries for any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date (other than a Tax Proceeding
described in _Section 7.6(d)_), Seller shall have the exclusive right to
control such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not
settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the
prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, if, in the case of any Combined Tax Return,
such settlement, compromise, or abandonment could have an adverse impact on
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for any Post-Closing Tax Period. If Seller
elects not to control the conduct and resolution of any Tax Proceeding that
Seller has the right to control pursuant to this _Section 7.6(b)_, Seller
shall notify Purchaser in writing, and Purchaser shall have the right to
control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Proceeding, or portion
thereof, that is not controlled by Seller; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall
not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(c)  In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to any
of the Purchased Entities or their respective Subsidiaries for any Straddle
Period (other than a Tax Proceeding described in _Section 7.6(d)_), the
Controlling Party shall have the right and obligation to conduct, at its own
expense, such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
Controlling Party shall provide the Non-Controlling Party with a timely and
reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) the
Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling Party before taking

faith as if it were the only party in interest in connection with such Tax
Proceeding, (v) the Non-Controlling Party shall be entitled to participate in
such Tax Proceeding and attend any meetings or conferences (including
telephonic) with the relevant Taxing Authority, and (vi) the
Controlling Party shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax
Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent of the Non-
Controlling Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the
Controlling Party shall not have any obligations (and the Non-Controlling
Party shall not have any rights) under clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (v) above
with respect to any portion of such Tax Proceeding (and any actions, written
materials, meetings or conferences relating exclusively thereto) that could
not reasonably be expected to affect the liability of, or otherwise have an
adverse effect on, the Non-Controlling Party or any of its Affiliates. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Controlling Party_ " shall mean Seller if
Seller and its Affiliates are reasonably expected to bear the greater Tax
liability in connection with such Tax Proceeding, or Purchaser if Purchaser
and its Affiliates are reasonably expected to bear the greater Tax
liability in connection with such Tax Proceeding; and " _Non-Controlling
Party_ " means whichever of Seller or Purchaser is not the Controlling Party
with respect to such Tax Proceeding.

cause to be changed any method of Tax accounting or any Tax accounting period
of any Purchased Entity or any Subsidiary thereof, which election or change
would be effective on or prior to the Closing Date or (c) take any action or

agreements of Seller to be performed on or before the Closing Date in
accordance with this Agreement shall have been performed in all material
respects.

  



  

(c)   _Officer 's Certificate_. Purchaser shall have received a
certificate, dated as of the Closing Date and signed on behalf of Seller by

Section 8.3   _Conditions to Obligations of Seller to Close_. In
addition to the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_, the obligation of
Seller to effect the Closing is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by
Seller) at or prior to the Closing of the following additional conditions:

  



  

(a)   _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of Purchaser contained in _Article IV_ (other than as set forth
in the following sentence) shall be true and correct as of the Closing Date as
if made on and as of the Closing Date (or, in the case of representations and
warranties that are made as of a specific date, as of such date), except
where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct (without giving effect to any materiality or "Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect" qualification set forth therein) would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. The representations
and warranties of Purchaser set forth in _Section 4.1_, _Section 4.2_ and 
_Section 4.10_ shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the
Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date (or, in the case of
representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date, as of such
date).

  



  

(b)   _Performance of Obligations of Purchaser_. The covenants
and agreements of Purchaser to be performed on or before the Closing Date in
accordance with this Agreement shall have been performed in all material
respects.

certificate, dated as of the Closing Date and signed on behalf of Purchaser
by an executive officer of Purchaser, stating that the conditions specified in
_Section 8.3(a)_ and  _Section 8.3(b)_ have been satisfied.

  



  

Section 8.4   _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither
Purchaser nor Seller may rely as a basis for terminating this Agreement on
the failure of any condition set forth in this _Article VIII_ to be satisfied
if such failure was caused by such Party's failure to act in good faith or to
use the efforts to cause the Closing to occur as required by this Agreement,
including _Section 5.1_.

  



  

Article IX 
 TERMINATION; EFFECT OF TERMINATION

  



  

Section 9.1   _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated and
the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

  



  

(a)  by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

  



  

(b)  by Seller, if Purchaser shall have breached any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, and such breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in _Section 8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ and has not been cured by the
earlier of (i) the date that is thirty (30) days after the date that Seller
has notified Purchaser of such breach stating Seller's intention to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 9.1(b)_ and the basis for such
termination and (ii) the Outside Date; _provided_ that Seller shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_ if
Seller has materially breached any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

  



  

   

-112-

 



    



  

(c)  by Purchaser, if Seller shall have breached any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, and such breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_ and has not been cured by the
earlier of (i) the date that is thirty (30) days after the date that Purchaser
has notified Seller of such breach stating Purchaser's intention to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_ and the basis for such
termination and (ii) the Outside Date; _provided_ that Purchaser shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_ if
Purchaser has materially breached any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

  



  

(d)  by Seller or by Purchaser, subject to _Section 11.7_, if
the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to February 12, 2020 (the "
_Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , that if on the Outside Date any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ shall not have been satisfied or
waived, then the Outside Date shall be automatically extended to be April 12,
2020; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_ shall not be available to (i) any Party
whose failure to perform any covenant or agreement under this Agreement or
whose breach of any representation or warranty has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date or
(ii) any Party during the pendency of any Proceeding brought by the other
Party for specific performance of this Agreement;

  



  

(e)  by Seller or by Purchaser, if a permanent Judgment issued
by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have become final
and nonappealable, preventing the consummation of the Transaction; _provided_
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(e)_
shall not be available to any Party whose failure to perform any covenant or
agreement under this Agreement or whose breach of any representation or
warranty has been the cause of, or resulted in, the issuance of such
Judgment; or

  



  

(f)  by Seller if (i) all of the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ have been satisfied or waived by Purchaser
in writing (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but which are capable of being satisfied), (ii)
Seller has confirmed in writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to such
termination that Seller stands ready, willing and able to consummate the
Closing, and (iii) Purchaser has failed to consummate the Closing within
three (3) Business Days of receipt by Purchaser of the written confirmation
referred to in clause (ii) of this sentence.

  



  

Section 9.2   _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is
terminated and the Transaction is abandoned as described in _Section
9.1_, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force and
effect, without any Liability or obligation on the part of any Party or its
Affiliates, directors, officers or employees; _provided_ that the last
sentence of _Section 5.1(e)_, the last sentence of _Section 5.8(a)_ and the
provisions of _Section 5.3_, _Section 9.1_, this _Section 9.2_,  _Section
9.3_, _Section 9.4_ and _Article XI_ shall remain in full force and effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 9.2_ shall release
or relieve Purchaser from any Liability in respect of reimbursement or
similar obligations with respect to Seller or its Affiliates expressly set
forth in this Agreement.

  



  

   

-113-

 



    



  

Section 9.3   _Notice of Termination_. In the event of termination
by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1_, written notice of such
termination shall be given by the terminating Party to the other Party.

  



  

Section 9.4   _Reverse Termination Fee._

  



  

(a)  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
9.1(b)_ or _Section 9.1(f)_ (or pursuant to another provision of _Section
9.1_ at a time when this Agreement is terminable pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_
or _Section 9.1(f)_) (a " _Specified Termination_ "), then Purchaser shall,
within two (2) Business Days of any such Specified Termination, pay to
Seller, in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated in writing by Seller, $141,000,000 (the " _Reverse Termination
Fee_ "). In no event shall the Reverse Termination Fee be payable on more than
one occasion.

  



  

(b)  Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 9.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other Party would not
enter into this Agreement. If Purchaser fails to promptly pay the Reverse
Termination Fee when due, Purchaser will reimburse Seller for all costs and
expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection
with the collection of such amounts and the enforcement by Seller of its
rights under this _Section 9.4_ (collectively, the " _Collection Fees and
Expenses_ ") within two (2) Business Days after Seller provides Purchaser
with a notice of such Collection Fees and Expenses. If Purchaser fails to
promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to this _Section 9.4_, Purchaser will
pay to Seller, from the date such payment was required to be paid until the
date of actual payment, interest at the Interest Rate on such amounts. The
Parties acknowledge that the Reverse Termination Fee will not constitute a
penalty but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Seller for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transaction, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

  



  

(c)  Subject to _Section 9.2_ and except as provided in the
last sentence of _Section 5.1(e)_, _Section 5.3_, the last sentence of
_Section 5.8(a)_ and in _Section 9.4(b)_, in a circumstance in which Seller
effects a Specified Termination and the Reverse Termination Fee is paid in
full pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_, (i) the Reverse Termination Fee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller against (A) Purchaser, (B) the
Guarantor under the Guaranty, (C) the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
or the Equity Commitment Letter and all other Financing Parties and (D) any
former, current or future general or limited partners, directors, officers,
employees, agents, members, managers, attorneys or representatives of any
Person named in the foregoing clauses (A), (B) or (C) or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives (the " _Purchaser Related Parties_
") for any loss suffered as a result of, relating to or arising out of such
Specified Termination, this Agreement, the Guaranty, the Equity Commitment
Letter, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, including any breach of this Agreement by Purchaser, the
termination of this Agreement or the failure to consummate the Transaction
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) none of
the Purchaser Related Parties shall have any further Liability or obligation
to Seller or any of its Affiliates as a result of, relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, the Guaranty, the Commitment Letters, the other Transaction
Documents, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or any claims
or actions arising out of any breach of this Agreement by Purchaser, the
termination of this Agreement or the failure to consummate the Transaction
and the other transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 9.4(c)_ shall limit (i) any remedies of Seller prior
to a Specified Termination, including specific performance pursuant to
_Section 11.7_, (ii) any of Purchaser's obligations under or
remedies available to Seller with respect to the Confidentiality Agreements,
whether in equity or at law, in contract, tort or otherwise or (iii) the
agreements, waivers and other obligations of Seller and its Subsidiaries under
_Section 11.16_.

Article X 
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 10.1   _Survival_.

  



  

(a)  The representations and warranties of Seller contained in
this Agreement shall not survive the Closing.

  



  

(b)  The representations and warranties of Purchaser contained
in this Agreement shall not survive the Closing.

  



  

(c)  The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement
that require performance in full prior to the Closing (and any rights arising
out of any breach of such covenants and agreements), in each case, shall not
survive the Closing, and the covenants and agreements in this Agreement that
by their terms apply or are to be performed, in whole or in part, after the
Closing (and any rights arising out of any breach of such covenants and
agreements), in each case, shall survive the Closing for the period provided
in such covenants and agreements, if any, or until fully performed. For the
avoidance of doubt, the obligation of Seller to retain, and indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for, any Retained
Liabilities, and the obligation of Purchaser to assume, and indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties for, any Assumed Liabilities,
as well as any covenants and agreements of the Parties that by their terms
provide for indemnification or reimbursement or allocate fees, payments,
costs or expenses as between the Parties, shall survive the Closing
indefinitely. No Person shall be entitled to indemnification, and no
Proceeding seeking to recover Covered Losses or other relief shall be
commenced or maintained, after the end of the relevant survival period set
forth herein, unless a claim for indemnification with respect thereto has
previously been made in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.2   _Indemnification by Seller_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to the provisions of this _Article X_, effective
as of and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Purchased
Entities and their Subsidiaries) and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys, accountants, representatives and successors
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against any
and all Covered Losses incurred or suffered by any of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties to the extent directly or indirectly resulting from or
arising out of (i) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller
contained in this Agreement that survives the Closing, for the period it
survives or (ii) any Retained Liabilities.

  



  

   

-115-

 



    



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

  



  

(i)  Seller shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless
any Purchaser Indemnified Party against, or reimburse any
Purchaser Indemnified Party for, any Covered Losses to the extent that such
Covered Losses or the related Liabilities are reflected, reserved, accrued,
recorded or included in the Closing Working Capital, the Adjustment Amount or
the Closing Funded Debt, in each case, as finally determined pursuant to this
Agreement; and

  



  

(ii)  the indemnification obligation of Seller under _Section
10.2(a)_ shall in no event exceed the Closing Purchase Price.

  



  

Section 10.3   _Indemnification by Purchaser_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to the provisions of this _Article X_, effective
as of and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys, accountants, representatives and successors
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against any and
all Covered Losses incurred or suffered by any of the Seller Indemnified
Parties to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from or arising out of
(i) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement that survives the Closing, for the period it survives or (ii) any
Assumed Liability.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the indemnification obligation of Purchaser under _Section 10.3(a)_ shall in
no event exceed the Closing Purchase Price.

  



  

Section 10.4   _Procedures_.

  



  

(a)  Any Person entitled to be indemnified under this _Article
X_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly give written notice to the
Party from whom indemnification may be sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_
") of any pending or threatened Proceeding against the Indemnified Party that
has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to such right of
indemnification with respect to such Proceeding (a " _Third Party Claim_ "),
indicating, with reasonable specificity, the nature of such Third Party
Claim, the basis therefor, a copy of any documentation received from the third
party, the amount and calculation of the Covered Losses (if then known) for
which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this
_Article X_ (and a good faith estimate of any such future Covered Losses
relating thereto), and the provision(s) of this Agreement in respect of which
such Covered Losses shall have occurred, and the Indemnified Party shall
promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party any information or documentation
related to the foregoing reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. A
failure by the Indemnified Party to give notice and to tender the defense of
the Proceeding in a timely manner pursuant to this  _Section 10.4(a)_ shall
not limit the obligations of the Indemnifying Party under this _Article X_,
except to the extent such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.

  



  

   

-116-

 



    



  

(b)  With respect to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party under this _Article X_ shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to assume the control and defense, at its own expense and by counsel of its
own choosing, of such Third Party Claim and any Third Party Claims related to
the same or a substantially similar set of facts; _provided_ that (except in
the case of any Retained Litigation Matters, Retained Reserve Liability
(subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 1.1(j)_  of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules) or other Third Party Claims relating thereto) the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the control and defense of
such Third Party Claim, and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
outside counsel retained by the Indemnified Party, if such Third Party Claim
is a criminal Proceeding. If the Indemnifying Party so undertakes to control
and defend any such Third Party Claim, it shall notify the Indemnified Party
of its intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense against, and
settlement of, any such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such Third Party Claim without
the written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement does not involve any
non-monetary relief against or any finding or admission of any violation of
Law or wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party, and any money damages are borne
solely by the Indemnifying Party. Subject to the foregoing, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to employ separate legal counsel and to
participate in but not control the defense of such Proceeding at its own cost
and expense; _provided_ that, subject to the provisions of this _Article X_,
the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees of one firm of legal
counsel (and one additional firm of legal counsel in each jurisdiction
implicated in such Proceeding) representing all Indemnified Parties in such
Proceeding and all related Proceedings, if, but only if, the defendants in
such Proceeding include both an Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party,
and such Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded, based on the
advice of legal counsel, that there is a material conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Proceeding. In any event, the Indemnified Party shall cause its legal counsel
to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its legal counsel and shall not
assert any position in any Proceeding inconsistent with that asserted by the
Indemnifying Party. No Indemnified Party may settle any Third Party Claim
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Indemnifying Party does not assume
the control and defense of a Third Party Claim, it shall nevertheless be
entitled to participate in the defense of such Proceeding at its own cost
and expense, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense against, and settlement of,
any such Third Party Claim.

  



  

(c)  In the event that any Indemnified Party has or may have an
indemnification claim against any Indemnifying Party under this  _Article X_
that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly give written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party indicating,
with reasonable specificity, the nature of such claim, the basis therefor, the
amount and calculation of the Covered Losses (if then known) for which the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this _Article X_ (and
a good-faith estimate of any such future Covered Losses relating thereto), and
the provision(s) of this Agreement in respect of which such Covered Losses
shall have occurred, and the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the
Indemnifying Party any information or documentation related to the foregoing
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. A failure by the
Indemnified Party to give notice in a timely manner pursuant to this _Section
10.4(c)_ shall not limit the obligations of the Indemnifying Party under this
_Article X_, except to the extent such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced
thereby. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to
such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in
good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved
through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in the
appropriate court of competent jurisdiction set forth in _Section 11.8_.

  



  

   

-117-

 



    



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
this _Section 10.4_ shall not apply with respect to any Tax Claim, which
shall be governed by _Section 7.6_.

  



  

Section 10.5   _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. Purchaser and Seller
acknowledge and agree that, except with respect to claims under the
Transition Services Agreement (which shall be governed exclusively by the
Transition Services Agreement) and claims seeking specific performance or
other equitable relief with respect to covenants or agreements to be performed
after the Closing, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of
_Section 10.2_ and _Section 10.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies
of Purchaser and Seller, respectively, and any of their respective Affiliates,
for any Liabilities (including in respect of any claims for breach of
contract (including for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement), warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence), under Law or
otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or
otherwise) that each Party may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject
to, as a result of or in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any breach of
any representation or warranty in this Agreement by any Party, or any breach
of or failure by any Party to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement
in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. In furtherance of the
foregoing, from and after the Closing, the Parties hereby waive, on behalf of
themselves and their Affiliates, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action (including rights
of contribution, if any) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist
or may arise in the future, that they may have against Seller or any of its
Affiliates, or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, as the case may be, as a
result of or in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether arising under or based
upon breach of contract (including for breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement), warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence),
under Law or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict
liability, or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Parties hereby irrevocably waive any right of rescission they may otherwise
have or to which they may become entitled.

  



  

Section 10.6   _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to
each indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement, all Covered
Losses shall be net of any third-party insurance or indemnity, contribution or
similar proceeds that have been recovered or are recoverable by the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise
to the right of indemnification (it being agreed that if third-party
insurance or indemnification, contribution or similar proceeds in respect of
such facts are recovered by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
subsequent to the Indemnifying Party's making of an indemnification payment
in satisfaction of its applicable indemnification obligation, such proceeds
shall be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party to the extent of the
indemnification payment made), and indemnification shall not be available
hereunder unless the Indemnified Party first uses, and causes its Affiliates
to use, reasonable best efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance and
indemnity, contribution or similar provisions covering such Covered Loss to
the same extent as it would if such Covered Loss were not subject to
indemnification hereunder. Upon making any payment to the Indemnified Party
for any indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article X_, the Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which
the Indemnified Party may have against any third parties with respect to the
subject matter underlying such indemnification claim, and the Indemnified
Party shall assign any such rights to the Indemnifying Party and otherwise
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in seeking recovery thereunder.

  



  

   

-118-

 



    



  

Section 10.7   _Mitigation_. Each of the Parties agrees to use, and to
cause its Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to mitigate its
respective Covered Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Covered
Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that indemnification under this _Article X_ shall not be available to any
Party or any Indemnified Party with respect to any Covered Loss to the extent
such Covered Loss results from or arises out of, in whole or in part, a
failure by such Person or its Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to
mitigate such Covered Loss.

  



  

Section 10.8   _Retained Litigation Matters_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to any claim for
indemnification by any Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to any Covered
Losses arising out of, or relating to, any Retained Litigation Matter, (i)
Seller shall only be required to indemnify, defend and hold harmless any such
Purchaser Indemnified Party for 50% of such Covered Losses until the
aggregate amount of such Covered Losses (either individually or together with
the aggregate amount of Covered Losses arising out of, or relating to, any
other Retained Litigation Matter identified on _Section 10.8_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules as being subject to the same maximum amount) exceeds the
maximum amount set forth on _Section 10.8_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules with respect to such Retained Litigation Matter(s) (such applicable
maximum amount with respect to any Retained Litigation Matter(s), the "
_Retained Litigation Sharing Cap_ ") and (ii) to the extent that the
aggregate amount of any such Covered Losses (either individually or together
with the aggregate amount of Covered Losses arising out of, or relating to,
any such other applicable Retained Litigation Matter) exceeds the applicable
Retained Litigation Sharing Cap, Seller shall be required to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless any such Purchaser Indemnified Party for 100% of any
such Covered Losses in excess of the applicable Retained Litigation Sharing
Cap in accordance with this _Article X_.

  



  

Article XI 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS

  



  

Section 11.1   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, and the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and thereto, and
the Confidentiality Agreements, along with the Seller Disclosure Schedules and
Purchaser Disclosure Schedules, constitute the entire agreement and
understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether
written or oral, relating to such subject matter. In the event of a conflict
between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Transaction
Document, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

  



  

   

-119-

 



    



  

Section 11.2   _Disclosure Schedules_. The Seller Disclosure Schedules
and the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules, and all schedules attached thereto,
and all Exhibits attached to this Agreement shall be construed with and as an
integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if the same had been
set forth verbatim herein. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit or in the
Seller Disclosure Schedules or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules but not
otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set forth in this Agreement.
Any information, item or other disclosure set forth in any Section of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules, as the
case may be, shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other Section
of _Article III_, in the case of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, or any
other Section of _Article IV_, in the case of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedules, and in each case, if the relevance of such disclosure
to such other Section is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure
notwithstanding the omission of a reference or a cross-reference with respect
thereto and notwithstanding any reference to a Section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules, as applicable, in
such Section of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 11.3   _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights and obligations hereunder may be assigned or transferred by either
Party (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that prior to the
Closing, Purchaser may assign its rights (but not any obligations) under this
Agreement to one or more Affiliates of Purchaser; _provided,_ that any such
assignment shall not (x) relieve Purchaser of its Liabilities or obligations
hereunder or (y) impede or delay the consummation of the Transaction or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any attempted assignment
in violation of this _Section 11.3_ shall be void. Subject to the two
preceding sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 11.4   _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties. By an instrument in writing, Purchaser, on the one hand, or Seller,
on the other hand, may, subject to _Section 11.16_, waive compliance by the
other with any term or provision of this Agreement that the other Party was or
is obligated to comply with or perform. Such waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with such term or provision shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure of
compliance.

  



  

Section 11.5   _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for _Section
9.4(c)_, _Section 10.2_, _Section 10.3_ and _Section 11.16_, which are
intended to benefit, and to be enforceable by, the Persons specified therein,

Section 11.7   _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a)  The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which
monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the Parties do not perform any provision of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Accordingly, subject to _Section 11.7(b)_, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that each of the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which
such Party is entitled in Law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other Party has an adequate remedy at
Law or that any such award is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law
or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such remedy. The
foregoing is in addition to any other remedy to which any Party is entitled
at law, in equity or otherwise. The Parties further agree that nothing set
forth in this _Section 11.7_ shall require any Party hereto to institute any
Proceeding for (or limit any Party's right to institute any Proceeding
for) specific performance under this _Section 11.7_ prior or as a condition
to exercising any termination right under _Article IX_ (and pursuing damages
after such termination). The Parties hereto agree that, notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to _Section
11.7(b)_, Seller shall be entitled to specific performance (or any other
equitable relief) to cause Purchaser to consummate the Closing and to cause
Purchaser to draw down the Cash Equity under the Equity Commitment Letter to
consummate the Closing, on the terms set forth herein.

  



  

   

-122-

 



    



  

(b)  Notwithstanding _Section 11.7(a)_, it is explicitly agreed
that the right of Seller to obtain specific performance to consummate the
Closing or to cause Purchaser to draw down the Cash Equity under the Equity
Commitment Letter to consummate the Closing shall be subject to the
requirements that:

  



  

(i)  Purchaser has failed to consummate the Closing in accordance
with _Section 2.3_;

  



  

(ii)  the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_
would have been satisfied or waived by Purchaser if the Closing were to have
occurred in accordance with _Section 2.3_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but which are capable of
being satisfied);

  



  

(iii)  the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing in
accordance with _Section 5.7_) has been funded or will be funded at the
Closing if the Cash Equity is funded at the Closing; and

  



  

(iv)  Seller has confirmed in writing to Purchaser that if specific
performance is granted and the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing
in accordance with _Section 5.7_) is funded and the Cash Equity is funded,
then Seller stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing.

  



  

Section 11.8   _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall
be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware. In addition, each of the Parties (a) in the
event that any dispute (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arises out of
this Agreement or the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom
within the State of Delaware, or in the event (but only in the event) that
such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the applicable
Proceeding, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware; (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (c)
agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement or
the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated hereby in any court
other than the above-named courts; and (d) agrees that it will not seek to
assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, that any such Proceeding
(i) is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) should be transferred or
removed to any court other than the above-named courts, (iii) should be
stayed by reason of the pendency of some other proceeding in any court other
than the above-named courts or (iv) that this Agreement or the subject matter
hereof may not be enforced in or by the above-named courts. Each Party agrees
that service of process upon such Party in any such Proceeding shall be
effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section 11.6_.

  



  

   

-123-

 



    



  

Section 11.9   _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY
OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
ADMINISTRATION THEREOF OR THE TRANSACTION OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN. NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK A JURY
TRIAL IN ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION
PROCEDURE BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED
INSTRUMENTS. NO PARTY WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A
JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT
BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES THAT IT HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS
_SECTION 11.9_. NO PARTY HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY
OTHER PARTY THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS _SECTION 11.9_ WILL NOT BE FULLY
ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES.

  



  

Section 11.10   _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other competent authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder
of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 11.11   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2)
or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument, and shall become effective when one (1) or more such counterparts
have been signed by each Party and delivered (by facsimile, e-mail, or
otherwise) to the other Party. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by
facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format"
from, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original
graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as
physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original signatures. This
Agreement has been executed in the English language. If this Agreement is
translated into another language, the English language text shall in any event
prevail.

  



  

Section 11.12   _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the Closing takes place, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Transaction and the other transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such expense.

  



  

   

-124-

 



    



  

Section 11.13   _Certain Information_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, no disclosure, representation or warranty shall be made
(or other action taken) pursuant to this Agreement that would involve the
disclosure of information to the extent such disclosure is prohibited by
applicable Law or a Governmental Entity (and no representation or warranty
shall be deemed breached or untrue as a result of any such disclosure not
being made for such reason so long as the Party not making such disclosure
has previously informed the other Party or its counsel that such Party is
unable to make a disclosure that would need to be made in order for such
representation and warranty to be true and correct and the general nature of
such omitted disclosure). To the extent legally permissible, the Parties will
cooperate in good faith to determine whether appropriate substitute
disclosures or actions can be made or taken under circumstances in which the
limitations of the preceding sentence apply.

  



  

Section 11.14   _Interpretation; Absence of Presumption_. It is understood
and agreed that the specification of any dollar amount in the representations
and warranties or covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or the
inclusion of any specific item in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or
Purchaser Disclosure Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts or
higher or lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are
not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts
or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Seller Disclosure
Schedules or Purchaser Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or controversy
between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
in this Agreement or included or not included in the Seller Disclosure
Schedules or Purchaser Disclosure Schedules is or is not material for purposes
of this Agreement. Nothing herein (including the Seller Disclosure Schedules
and the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules) shall be deemed an admission by
either Party or any of its Affiliates, in any Proceeding or action, that such
Party or any such Affiliate, or any third party, is or is not in breach or
violation of, or in default in, the performance or observance of any term or
provisions of any Contract or any Law. For the purposes of this Agreement,
(a) words in the singular shall be held to include the plural and vice versa,
and words of one gender shall be held to include the other gender as the
context requires; (b) references to the terms Article, Section, paragraph,
Exhibit and Schedule are references to the Articles, Sections, paragraphs,
Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement unless otherwise specified; (c) the
terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby,"  "hereto," and derivative or similar
words refer to this entire Agreement, including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the words "date hereof" refer to the date of this Agreement; (d)
references to "Dollars" or "$" shall mean U.S. dollars; (e) the word
"including" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents shall mean "including, without limitation," unless
otherwise specified; (f) the word  "or" shall not be exclusive; (g)
references to "written" or "in writing" include in electronic form; (h)
provisions shall apply, when appropriate, to successive events and
transactions; (i) the headings contained in this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in
any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents; (j) Seller and Purchaser have each participated in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
and if an ambiguity or question of interpretation should arise, this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the Parties or the parties thereto, as applicable, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or burdening any party by
virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions in this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents; (k) a reference to any Person includes such
Person's successors and permitted assigns; (l) any reference to "days" means
calendar days unless Business Days are expressly specified; (m) when
calculating the period of time before which, within which or following which
any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that
is the reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded and if the
last day of such period is not a Business Day, the period shall end on the
next succeeding Business Day; (n) any Law defined or referred to in this
Agreement or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein
means such Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor
Laws and the related regulations thereunder and published interpretations
thereof, and references to any Contract or instrument are to that Contract or
instrument as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented; _provided_
that, for purposes of any representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement that are made as of a specific date or dates, references to any Law
shall be deemed to refer to such Law, as amended, and the related regulations
thereunder and published interpretations thereof, in each case, as of such
date; and (o) to the extent that this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document requires an Affiliate of any Party to take or omit to take any
action, such covenant or agreement includes the obligation of such Party to
cause such Affiliate to take or omit to take such action.

Section 11.15   _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion
of Attorney-Client Privilege_.

  



  

(a)  Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause
its Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the Purchased Companies and
their Subsidiaries, to waive and not assert, any conflict of interest arising
out of or relating to the representation, after the Closing (the " _Post-
Closing Representation_ "), of Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any
shareholder, officer, employee or director of Seller or any of its Affiliates
(any such Person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any matter involving this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, by any legal counsel currently
representing any Designated Person in connection with this Agreement, the
other Transaction Documents or any other agreements or transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz (any
such representation, the " _Current Representation_ ").

  



  

(b)  Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause
its Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the Purchased Companies and
their Subsidiaries, to waive and not assert, any attorney-client or other
applicable legal privilege or protection with respect to any communication
between any legal counsel and any Designated Person occurring during the
Current Representation (the " _Privileged Communications_ ") or in connection
with any Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute
with Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, any
Purchased Company or any of its Subsidiaries), including in respect of any
claim for indemnification by a Purchaser Indemnified Party, it being the
intention of the Parties that all such rights to such attorney-client and
other applicable legal privilege or protection and to control such attorney-
client and other applicable legal privilege or protection shall be retained
by Seller and its Affiliates and that Seller, and not Purchaser or its
Affiliates or the Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries, shall have the
sole right to decide whether or not to waive any attorney-client or other
applicable legal privilege or protection. Accordingly, from and after Closing,
none of Purchaser or its Affiliates, including the Purchased Companies and
their Subsidiaries, shall have any access to any such communications or
to the files of the Current Representation, all of which shall be and remain
the property of Seller and not of Purchaser or its Affiliates, including the
Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries, or to internal counsel relating to
such engagement, and none of Purchaser or its Affiliates, including,
following the Closing, the Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries, or any
Person acting or purporting to act on their behalf shall seek to obtain the
same by any process on the grounds that the privilege and protection
attaching to such communications and files belongs to Purchaser or its
Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the Purchased Companies and
their Subsidiaries, or does not belong to Seller. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser or its
Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the Purchased Companies and
their Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third party other than Seller or
its Affiliates, on the other hand, Purchaser or its Affiliates, including,
following the Closing, the Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries, may
seek to prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Communications to such third
party and request that Seller not permit such disclosure, and Seller shall
consider such request in good faith.

  



  

   

-126-

 



    



  

Section 11.16   _Certain Financing Provisions_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Seller on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries
and each of its controlled Affiliates hereby: (a) agrees that any Proceeding,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
involving the Financing Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the Debt Financing or any of the agreements (including the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Definitive Agreements) entered into in connection with the Debt
Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance of any services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New
York, New York, so long as such forum is and remains available, and any
appellate court thereof, and each party hereto irrevocably submits itself and
its property with respect to any such Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction
of such court, (b) agrees that any such Proceeding (including any claims or
causes of action giving rise thereto) shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to
any conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the
laws of another state), except as otherwise expressly provided in the Debt
Commitment Letter or the applicable definitive document relating to the Debt
Financing (including the applicable Definitive Agreement), (c) agrees not to
bring or support or permit any of its controlled Affiliates to bring or
support any Proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Party in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Definitive Agreements or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder in any forum other than any federal or state court in the
Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, (d) agrees that service of process
upon Seller, its Subsidiaries or its controlled Affiliates in any
such Proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with
_Section 11.6_, (e) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may
effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such Proceeding in any such court, (f) knowingly, intentionally and
voluntarily waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law trial
by jury in any Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, brought against the Financing Parties in any way
arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing, any of the
agreements (including the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive
Agreements) entered into in connection with the Debt Financing or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder and (g) agrees that none of the Financing Parties will
have any liability to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective controlled Affiliates or Representatives (in each case, other than
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries) relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Definitive Agreements or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of
any services thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise. The parties hereto hereby agree that the Financing
Parties are express third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the
provisions in this _Section 11.16_, and that such provisions and the
definitions of "Financing Entities" and "Financing Parties" and this _Section
11.16_ shall not be amended, waived or otherwise modified, in each case, in
any way adverse to the Financing Parties without the prior written consent of
the Financing Entities (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) (and any such amendment, waiver or other modification
without such prior written consent shall be null and void).

  



  

   

-127-

 



    



  

Section 11.17   _Non-Recourse_. The Parties agree that all Proceedings
based on, in respect of or arising out of (a) this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreements, the Commitment Letters, the Guaranty or the other
Transaction Documents or (b) the negotiation, execution or performance or
breach hereof or thereof, or the failure to perform any covenant or agreement
contained herein or therein, or to consummate the Transaction or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, may only be made against the
Persons that are expressly identified as Parties to this Agreement (and their
respective successors and permitted assigns) (other than with respect to any
claims by or between the express parties or express third-party beneficiaries
(in each case, including their successors or permitted assigns) to the
Confidentiality Agreements, the Commitment Letters, the Guaranty or the other
Transaction Documents in accordance with the terms thereof). No other Person
shall have any Liability in respect of any Proceedings based on, in respect
of or arising out of the matters set forth in clauses (a) or (b) of the
immediately preceding sentence. Nothing in this _Section 11.17_ shall limit
the rights or remedies available to the express parties or express third-party
beneficiaries to the Confidentiality Agreements, the Commitment Letters, the
Guaranty or the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the terms
thereof.
