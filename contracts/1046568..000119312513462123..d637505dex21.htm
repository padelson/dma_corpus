notice (the "Notice of Claim") to the other Party (the "Notified Party") and
shall provide all reasonable particulars thereof. It is expressly agreed
between the Parties that any Notice of Claim given after the expiry of the

the Parties will attempt to resolve any differences which they may have with
respect to any matters constituting the subject matter of such notice. If, at
the end of such period, the Parties fail to reach an agreement in writing
with respect to all such matters, then all matters as to which agreement is
not so reached shall, thereafter, be submitted by any of the Parties to a
court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. The amounts due by the Notified Party to the Notifying Party under

awarded by the court; and

party against the Target Entities and/or the Purchaser constituting the
subject matter of a Notice of Claim to the Sellers, the Purchaser shall have
the right to contest, defend or litigate such Third Party Claim, with counsel
of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers. The Sellers shall have
the right to be represented by counsel at its own expense in any such contest,
defense, litigation or settlement conducted by the Purchaser. The
Purchaser shall have the exclusive right to contest, defend and litigate the
Third Party Claim and shall have the exclusive right, in its discretion
exercised in reasonable, good faith, and upon the advice of counsel, to settle
any such matter, either before or after the initiation of litigation, at such
time and upon such terms as it deems fair and reasonable; provided, that at
least five (5) Business Days prior to any such settlement, written notice of
its intention to settle shall be given to the Sellers and that the Sellers
shall not reasonably contest in writing the purchasers decision to settle.
All expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by the Purchaser in

basis hereunder upon which the Indemnified Partys claim for indemnification

misrepresentation or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein or in any closing document executed and delivered
pursuant to the provisions hereof, except for claims of fraud and claims for
injunctive or other equitable relief. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, from and after the Closing, no legal action sounding in
contribution, tort or strict liability may be maintained by any Party hereto
(or a Purchaser Indemnitee or Sellers Indemnitee not a Party hereto) against
any other Party hereto with respect to any matter that is the subject of this
_Article VII_.

 

7.10 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments._

 

The Parties agree that for all federal, state, local, and foreign income Tax

8.14 _Interpretation._

 

Unless this Agreement expressly provides otherwise, each definition herein
applies (i) for purposes of this entire Agreement, and (ii) to both the
singular and plural forms (and other grammatical variations) of the defined
term. Each provision of this Agreement shall have independent significance
such that application of any provision of this Agreement shall not prevent or
mitigate application of any other provision of this Agreement. Unless the
context indicates otherwise, each pronoun herein shall be deemed to include
the masculine, feminine, neuter, singular and plural forms thereof. The
term "Person" shall be construed broadly to include any individual, any type
of business entity (including a corporation, joint-stock company, partnership
or limited liability company), any other type of legal entity (including a
trust or association ), or any Educational Agency or Governmental Authority.
The terms "including", "includes", "include" and words of like import shall be
construed broadly as if followed by the words "without limitation" or "but
not limited to". The terms "herein", "hereunder", "hereof" and words of like
import refer to this entire Agreement instead of just the provision in which
they are found. The term "pending" shall mean pending (but shall not be
construed as referring to any action, suit or proceeding against the Sellers
or any Target Entity that has been filed but not yet served on the Sellers or
a Target Entity), and "threatened" means threatened (and shall be construed
as referring, without limitation, to any action, suit or proceeding against
the Sellers or any Target Entity that has been filed but not yet served on the
Sellers or a Target Entity). This Agreement shall not be construed strictly
against the drafter (and any rule of construction to that effect shall not be
applied).

 

8.15 _Headings._

only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
