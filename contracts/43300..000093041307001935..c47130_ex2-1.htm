ARTICLE III

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

  

 SECTION 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub: 

    

 (a)  _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock owned by the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 (c)  _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 3.1(d) and 3.2(d) and other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.1(b), each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive without interest 0.12963 of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock (the " _Per Share Stock Consideration_ ") and $9.00 in cash (the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Per Share Stock Consideration and any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 3.2(d), the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "; the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration and the aggregate Per Share Stock Consideration into which all shares of Company Common Stock may be converted pursuant to this Section 3.1 is referred to herein as the " _Aggregate Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock converted into the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III shall automatically be canceled, cease to exist and no longer be outstanding, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 3.2(b) and in each case without interest. 

  

 (d)  _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenters  Rights Statute_") who did not vote in favor of the Merger or consent thereto in writing and who complies in all other respects with the Dissenters Rights Statute (such shares, " _Dissent Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(c), but the holders of Dissent Shares shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissent Shares in accordance with the Dissenters Rights Statute; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall validly waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissent Shares under the Dissenters Rights Statute, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissent Shares shall cease and such Dissent Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided in Section 3.1(c). At the Effective Time, all Dissent Shares shall automatically be canceled, cease to exist and no longer be outstanding, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any Dissent Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive either payment of the fair value of such Dissent Shares in accordance with the Dissenters Rights Statute or the Per Share Merger Consideration, as the case may be, upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 3.2(b) (without interest). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any written demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the Dissenters Rights Statute received by 

 

  the Company relating to rights of appraisal under the Dissenters Rights
Statute, and Parent shall have the right to control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Each holder of Dissent Shares who becomes entitled to payment for
such shares pursuant to the Dissenters Rights Statute shall receive payment
therefor from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the Dissenters
Rights Statute.

  

 SECTION 3.2 _Payment to Company Stockholders_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall appoint American Stock Transfer and Trust Company to be the Companys exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging the Per Share Merger Consideration for certificates formerly representing Company Common Stock. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent cash and Parent Common Stock in an amount equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger and authorize the Exchange Agent to issue shares of Parent Common Stock upon the exchange of certificates formerly representing Company Common Stock therefor. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the certificates formerly representing Company Common Stock to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. 

  

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a certificate formerly representing Company Common Stock, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, payable for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such certificate. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Per Share Merger Consideration. 

  

 (c) If any portion of the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered certificate formerly representing Company Common Stock is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any Transfer Taxes or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, and fractional share interests of Parent Common Stock shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of this Section 3.2(d), the fractional shares of Parent Common Stock of a single record holder shall be determined after aggregating all certificates and shares of such holder and calculations shall be rounded to five decimal places. Each holder who would otherwise be entitled to receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock but for this Section 3.2(d) shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock held by such holder and (ii) (A) the Per Share Cash Consideration plus (B) (x) the Per Share Stock Consideration multiplied by (y) the closing price of the Parent Common Stock on the NYSE (regular way) on the Trading Day immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock or of certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, certificates formerly representing Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Per Share Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article III. 

  

 (f) Any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.2(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Common Stock 180 days after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged certificates formerly representing Company Common Stock for the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.2 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of such certificates formerly representing Company Common Stock without any interest thereon, but such holders shall have no greater rights against Parent and the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto than are accorded to general creditors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall not be liable to any holder of certificates formerly representing Company Common Stock for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. If any certificates formerly representing Company Common Stock have not been surrendered prior to the date five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Per Share Merger Consideration or any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 3.2(h) in respect of such certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (g) Parent and/or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent and/or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

  

 (h) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any certificate formerly representing Company Common Stock with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof until the surrender of such certificate in accordance with this Article III. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender, and a payment date subsequent to such surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

   SECTION 3.3 _Treatment of Options, Restricted Stock, Other Equity Awards and Warrants_.

  

 (a) The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted or will adopt prior to the Effective Time resolutions, and the Company has taken and/or shall take, as applicable, all actions, necessary prior to the Effective Time to effect the following: 

     



  |  



   
---|--- 
   



  |  

 (i) no less than 15 days prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding under the Company Stock Plans or any other stock option or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of the Company (each, a " _Stock Option_ ") shall, with no further action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, become fully vested and exercisable; 

   
   



  |  



   
   



  |  

 (ii) at the Effective Time, each Stock Option (other than any Stock Option to which Section 3.3(a)(iii) is applicable) shall be canceled, and the holder of such Stock Option shall become entitled to receive for such Stock Option a single lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock such holder could have purchased had such holder exercised such Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of (I) the per share closing price of Company Common Stock, as such price is quoted on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, as reported in the transactions index of the NASDAQ Global Market (as published in The Wall Street Journal, or, if no closing price was quoted in any such index for such date, then as of the next preceding date on which such a closing price is quoted) (the " _Company Closing Price_ ") over (II) the exercise price per share of such Stock Option (for the avoidance of doubt, if with respect to any Stock Option (other any Stock Option to which Section 3.3(a)(iii) is applicable) the amount determined under (II) is equal to or greater than the amount determined under (I), such Stock Option shall be canceled for no consideration); 

   
   



  |  



   
   



  |  

 (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Stock Options that were granted under the Company Stock Plans prior to June 9, 2005 (each such Stock Option, a " _Pre-Amendment Option_ "), (A) the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and has obtained from the individuals named in Section 3.3(a)(iii)(A) of the Company Disclosure Letter, any consents that are required to effect the cancellation of any such Pre-Amendment Option that has an exercise price per share that is less than the Company Closing Price and the payment to the holder of such canceled Pre-Amendment Option of a single lump sum cash payment at the Effective Time, determined in accordance with the formula set forth in Section 3.3(a)(ii), and (B) any such Pre-Amendment Option that is not so canceled and cashed out (or, for the avoidance of doubt, that has an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the Company Closing Price) shall, at the Effective Time, cease to represent an option to purchase Company Common Stock and shall be converted into an option to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Pre-Amendment Option (taking into account any vesting or other changes provided for in the applicable Company Stock Plan or in any award or other agreement governing the terms and conditions thereof, as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (including Section 3.3(a)(i)) and by the Ancillary Agreements), (A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (I) the number of shares of Company Common Stock such holder could have purchased had such holder exercised such Pre-Amendment Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (II) the Option Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded up or down to the nearest whole share, at (B) a price per share equal to (I) the exercise price per share of such Pre-Amendment Option, divided by (II) the Option Exchange 

   
    Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up or down to the
nearest cent. The " _Option Exchange Ratio_ " means the quotient of (x) the
Company Closing Price, and (y) $27.00;

     



  |  



   
---|--- 
   



  |  

 (iv)  at the Effective Time, each award of Company Common Stock subject to  restrictions on transfer and/or forfeiture then outstanding under the Company  Stock Plans or any other stock or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement  of the Company shall, with no further action on the part of the Company or  the holder thereof, become fully vested and converted into the right to  receive a single lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number  of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such award immediately prior to  the Effective Time and (B) the Company Closing Price; and 

   
   



  |  



   
   



  |  

 (v)  at the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units relating to  Company Common Stock then outstanding under the Company Stock Plans or any  other stock or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of the Company  shall, with no further action on the part of the Company or the holder  thereof, become fully vested and converted into the right to receive a single  lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of  Company Common Stock applicable to such award immediately prior to the  Effective Time and (B) the Company Closing Price. 

   
   

 (b) At the Effective Time, with no further action on the part of the Company or any holder of Company Common Stock, Parent shall (i) issue the warrants provided for in the Yucaipa Warrant Agreement in exchange for the 2005 Warrants on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, and (ii) assume the obligations of the Company under the 2000 Warrants, such that after such assumption the holders of such assumed warrants shall have the right to purchase Parent Common Stock on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the 2000 Warrants and the 2000 Warrant Agreement. 

  

 (c) Parent shall be entitled to (or cause the Company to) deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any party pursuant to this Section 3.3 such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent (or the Company), such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the party in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 SECTION 3.4 _Adjustments_.

  

 (a) If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Company Common Stock shall occur (other than pursuant to the exercise of stock options or warrants or upon the vesting of restricted units, in each case, that are outstanding on the date hereof and pursuant to their terms in existence on the date hereof) by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or reverse stock split of Company Common Stock, or stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted. 

  

 (b) If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Parent Common Stock shall occur (other than pursuant to the exercise of stock options or warrants or upon the vesting of restricted units, in each case, that are outstanding on the date hereof and pursuant to their terms in existence on the date hereof) by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or reverse stock split of Parent Common Stock, or stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted. 

   SECTION 3.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any certificate formerly representing Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of Company Common Stock represented by such certificate, as contemplated by this Article III. 

  

ARTICLE IV

  (a) Each Parent Plan and, to Parents knowledge, each Parent Multiemployer Plan has been operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the terms of

   all Collective Bargaining Agreements or any other labor-related agreements
with any labor union or labor organization applicable to employees of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries and the requirements of all applicable Laws,
including ERISA and the Code. As of the date hereof, no Action is pending or,
to Parents knowledge, threatened with respect to any Parent Plan (other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course) that would result in any material
liability to Parent and, to Parents knowledge, no fact or event exists that
would give rise to any such Action. As of the date hereof, to Parents
knowledge, (i) no Action is pending or threatened with respect to any Parent
Multiemployer Plan (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course)
that would result in any material liability to Parent and (ii) no fact or
event exists that would give rise to any such Action.

  

  (b) No withdrawal liability has been incurred under Title IV of ERISA by Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates with respect to any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) which is or has been contributed to by Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates at any time during the six-year period ending on the date of this Agreement or as to which Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability (the " _Parent Multiemployer Plans_ "), and no such liability would be incurred if Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates were to withdraw from any Parent Multiemployer Plan in a complete or partial withdrawal. Parent has not agreed with any Person to be responsible for any liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.

  

  (c) With respect to any Parent Plan which is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I or to Title IV of ERISA (a " _Parent Title IV Plan_"): (i) there is no lien under Section 412(n) of the Code by reason of an accumulated funding deficiency, whether or not waived, under Section 412 of the Code; (ii) no liability (other than liability for premiums) to the PBGC has been incurred and all premiums required to be paid to the PBGC have been paid by or on behalf of such Parent Title IV Plan; (iii) the assets of each Parent Title IV Plan equal or exceed the benefit liabilities of such Parent Title IV Plan determined on a termination basis; and (iv)as of the date hereof, Parent has received no actual notice from the PBGC that an event or condition exists which (A) would constitute grounds for termination of such Parent Title IV Plan by the PBGC or (B) has caused a partial termination of such Parent Title IV Plan.

  

  (d) All contributions to Parent Plans and, to Parents knowledge, the Parent Multiemployer Plans required to be made by applicable Law or the terms of the applicable Parent Plan have been timely made. Each Parent Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has timely received a favorable determination letter from the IRS which has not been revoked (or in either case Parent has timely applied for same or will do so) and each trust established in connection with any Parent Plan which is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS which has not been revoked that it is so exempt, and, to Parents knowledge, no fact or event has occurred since the date of such determination letter or letters from the IRS that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Parent Plan or the exempt status of any such trust. To Parents knowledge, each Parent Multiemployer Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified.

  

  (e) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability, neither Parent nor any of its ERISA Affiliates, and to Parents knowledge no other Person, has engaged in any transaction or acted or failed to act in any manner that would subject Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates to any liability for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA.

  

  (f) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability, neither Parent nor any of its ERISA Affiliates and, to Parents knowledge, no other Person has engaged in any transaction in violation of Section 406(a) or (b) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975(c) or (d) of the Code.

All Permits required to conduct the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted have been obtained by one or more of Parent or its Subsidiaries and all such Permits are in full force and effect and the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries is being operated in compliance therewith, except for such Permits the failure of which to possess or be in full force and effect or to be complied with has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (except that this sentence shall not apply to any Permits which are covered by Section 5.6).

The Company shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Representatives of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions and negotiations, if any, with any Third Party or 13D Group conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Company Proposal and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such Third Party or 13D Group (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential information about the Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company prior to the date hereof to return or destroy all such information. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.3(a) by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.3(a) by the Company. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company receives a Company Proposal that was not solicited, or knowingly encouraged or facilitated, by the Company in violation of Section 6.3(a), and which either constitutes a Superior Proposal or which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failing to take such action described in clause (i) or (ii) below would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (i) engage in negotiations or discussions (including the solicitation of a revised Company Proposal) with such Third Party or 13D Group and (ii) furnish to such Third Party or 13D Group and its attorneys, auditors, advisors and financing sources non-public information relating to, and afford such Third Party or 13D Group access to, the business, properties, assets, books and records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement no less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall provide as promptly as practicable, to Parent any material information provided to such Third Party or 13D Group that has not previously been provided to Parent. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from complying with Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act with regard to a Company Proposal, or from making any other legally required disclosure to the stockholders of the Company with regard to the Company Proposal under federal securities Laws, the regulations of any national securities exchange on which the Company Common Stock is listed or as required under Delaware Law. For the avoidance of doubt, for all purposes under this Agreement, including Article VIII, any disclosure by the Board of Directors of the status of any Company Proposal (without comment on the merits thereof) or any stop-look-listen communication under Rule 14d-9(f) shall not, in and of itself, be considered an Adverse Recommendation Change or a violation of this Section 6.3. 

   (c) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger or (B) publicly recommend the approval or adoption of, or propose to recommend, any Company Proposal or Superior Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) whether or not required by Law, being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to any Company Proposal, other than any confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.3(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Section 6.3 or otherwise in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may, if, after consultation with its outside counsel, it determines in good faith that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, make an Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change until after the fifth Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice (a " _Notice of Adverse Change_ ") from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including (if such change is due to a Superior Proposal) the material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal (including a summary of the financial, legal, regulatory or other aspects that related to the Board of Directors of the Companys determination that such Company Proposal is a Superior Proposal) that is the basis of the proposed action by such Board of Directors (it being understood and agreed that, prior to taking any such action, the Company shall discuss with Parent and consider in good faith any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise). 

  

 (d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections 6.3(b) and (c), the Company shall as promptly as practicable advise Parent in writing of the receipt after the date of this Agreement of any Company Proposal or any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Proposal or inquiry, the material terms and conditions of any such Company Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the Third Party or 13D Group making any such Company Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed in all material respects of the status of (including any material developments with respect to) any such Company Proposal or inquiry (including any material changes thereto).

   posal or (B) any Adverse Recommendation Change ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this sentence shall affect the Companys right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII). The Company agrees that it

Parent agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of the stockholders of Parent at the Parent Stockholders Meeting any matters other than the approval of the Share Issuance and the Preemptive Rights Charter Amendment. The approval of the Share Issuance and the Preemptive Rights Charter Amendment shall be conditioned on each other, such that neither shall be deemed to be approved unless both are approved by the Parent stockholders. 

  

 SECTION 6.5 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to use, its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable (including complying with its obligation under Section 6.5(b)) to arrange and obtain the full proceeds of the Financing Commitments (the " _Financing_ ") on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments, including using its best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein, (iii) to satisfy (or cause their Affiliates to satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions, and otherwise comply with all terms, applicable to Parent and Merger Sub (or their Affiliates) in such definitive agreements and (iv) consummate the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments at or prior to Closing. In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing Commitments, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly use its best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but not later than the last day of the Marketing Period. Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub with any portion of the Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party of the Financing Commitments or any termination of the Financing Commitments. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall refrain (and shall use its best efforts to cause its Affiliates to refrain) from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of any of the conditions contained in the Financing Commitments or in any definitive agreement related to the Financing. Parent shall keep the Company fully informed in all material respects of the status of Parents and Merger Subs efforts to arrange the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall not amend, supplement, modify or waive any provision or remedy under the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing, without the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. For the 

   avoidance of doubt, in the event (x) all or a portion of Financing
Commitments structured as notes has not been consummated, (y) all conditions
contained in Article VII have been satisfied or waived (other than those
contained in Sections 7.2(c) and 7.3(c) and those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions) and (z) the bridge facilities contemplated by the
Financing Commitments (or alternative financing obtained in accordance with
this Section 6.5(a)) are available, then Parent and Merger Sub shall use the
proceeds of such bridge financing (or alternative financing) for the purpose
of consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 (b) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, to sell or otherwise dispose of up to 7.1 million shares of Metro, Inc. common stock within 90 days of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , if the net cash proceeds to Parent of such disposition are less than $190.0 million, then Parent shall issue and sell within such 90-day period shares of Parent Common Stock and/or its preferred stock sufficient to generate net cash proceeds in an amount equal to the difference between $190.0 million and the net cash proceeds received from the sale or disposition of such Metro, Inc. common stock. The net cash proceeds of such sale or disposition, together with the net cash proceeds of any such issuance and sale of Parent Common Stock and/or Parents preferred stock, shall be deposited into a blocked account at Bank of America on which Parents lenders under its credit agreement existing as of the date of this Agreement have a first priority security interest and shall be held (without diminution) in such account through the Closing, free and clear of all other Encumbrances. The funds in the blocked account shall be used as part of the consideration for the transactions under the Agreement and, pending such use, may be used (without diminution) to support letters of credit under Parents credit agreement existing as of the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) From the date hereof until the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall use its best efforts to cause (to the extent within its control) each of its officers, employees and other Representatives to, provide such cooperation as is reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, including (i) causing appropriate officers to be available, on a customary basis and on reasonable advance notice, to attend due diligence sessions, sessions with ratings agencies, meetings, presentations, and, during the Marketing Period and road shows; (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, information and offering memoranda, business projections and financial statements, to the extent relating to the Company; (iii) issuing customary representation letters to auditors and using its best efforts to cause its independent accountants to provide reasonable assistance to Parent, including requesting such accountants to provide consent to Parent to use their audit reports relating to the Company and to prepare and deliver any customary "comfort letters"; (iv) providing reasonable access to the Real Property during normal business hours to the extent required by the Financing Commitments; (v) as promptly as reasonably practicable, furnishing Parent and its debt financing sources financial statements, pro forma financial information, financial data, audit reports and other information relating to the Company of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and the other accounting rules and regulations of the SEC as may reasonably be requested by Parent and of the type and form required to be included in a registered public offering on Form S-1 (all such information in this clause (v), the " _Required Information_ "); (vi) cooperating in satisfying the conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments (to the extent the satisfaction of such condition requires the cooperation of the Company); (vii) promptly providing monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) to the extent available and prepared by the Company in the ordinary course of business generally consistent with past practice; (viii) executing and delivering, as of the Effective Time, any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates or documents contemplated by the Financing Commitments as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including a customary representation letter of the chief financial officer of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company with respect to consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the debt financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments) and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral (including obtaining the insurance, surveys, releases, 

   terminations, waivers, consents, estoppels and approvals as may be required
in connection therewith) contemplated by the Financing Commitments; and (ix)
as of the Effective Time, taking all corporate actions necessary to authorize
the consummation of the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments.
The Company will periodically update any such Required Information to be
included in an offering document to be used in connection with such financing
so that such Required Information complies with clause (v) of the preceding
sentence. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitments; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to or likely to harm or disparage the Company or
its Subsidiaries. All material non-public information regarding the Company
and its Subsidiaries provided to Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives
pursuant to this Section 6.5(b) shall be kept confidential by them in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement except for disclosure to
potential investors as required in connection with the Financing subject to
customary confidentiality protections.

  

 (d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other liability in connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1, then Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company solely as a result of its compliance with this Section 6.5. 

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 or otherwise shall require the Company to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Financing prior to the Closing. 

  

 (g) If, prior to the Effective Time, the Company incurs debt under the "accordion" feature of the Company Credit Agreement, then the Company shall use its best efforts to facilitate the mortgaging of the owned Real Property identified in Section 6.1(d)(i)(D) of the Company Disclosure Letter (including obtaining surveys, releases, terminations, waivers, consents, estoppels and approvals as may be required in connection therewith) by Parent at the Effective Time. 

  

 SECTION 6.6 _Filings; Authorizations_. 

  

 (a) The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall promptly provide or file or cause to be provided or filed all necessary filings with Governmental Entities and any additional information requested by any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall promptly inform each other and provide each other with copies of any material communication or correspondence made to or received by, such party or its advisors from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall promptly cooperate and consult with respect to the preparation and submission of any filings, communication or correspondence with a Governmental Entity that may be required by Law or be considered by Parent, after consultation with the Company, to be desirable, as well as with respect to the preparation and submission of any information requested by a Governmental Entity, including, to the extent practicable and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and any restrictions under the Antitrust Laws, by providing to Parent, in the case of the Company, or the Company, in the case of Parent, or its outside counsel information and assistance that may reasonably be requested for such purpose. Any such filings, materials or information marked or designated by the providing party as "Highly Confidential" shall be disclosed only to outside legal counsel and expert consultants to the recipient party and shall be redacted from any copies of filings 

   or other materials that may be disclosed to the recipient party or other
Representatives of the recipient party. Each of the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall, to the extent
practicable, permit the other to review any material communication,
correspondence, submission or filing between it (or its advisors) and any
Governmental Entity relating to this Agreement and shall, to the extent
practicable, consult with the other in advance of any telephone calls,
meetings or conferences with, any Governmental Entity and, to the
extent practicable, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such telephone calls, meetings and conferences.

  

 (c) In addition to the agreements set forth in Section 6.6(a), the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall (i) as promptly as practicable take all actions necessary to make the filings required under the HSR Act but in any event not later than ten Business Days following the date of this Agreement and (ii) use their respective best efforts to substantially comply at the earliest practicable date with any request for additional information or documentary material received by Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates from the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR Act or from any state attorney general unless Parent and the Company mutually determine that it is reasonable under the circumstances not to comply substantially with any requests for additional information and documentary material under the HSR Act. 

  

 (d) The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall promptly cooperate with one another in determining whether any filing with a Governmental Entity, in addition to the HSR Act filings set forth in Section 6.6(c), is required or reasonably appropriate, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in taking such actions or making any such filings, the parties shall furnish such information as may be required in connection therewith and timely seek to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. 

  

 (e) Without limiting Section 6.6(a), each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, subject to the termination rights set forth in Sections 8.1(c)(iii) and (iv), use their respective best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act as soon as practicable and to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their best efforts to (i) seek to avoid the entry of, or seek to have vacated or terminated, any order, judgment, decree, injunction or ruling of a court or any other Governmental Entity that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including by defending through litigation any Action asserted by any Person in any court or before any other Governmental Entity and by exhausting all avenues of appeal and (ii) take, or cause to be taken, all other actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, including (A) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, transfer, divestiture or disposition of such stores, businesses or other assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or, after the Effective Time, of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries and (B) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that limit or would limit Parents, Merger Subs or its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the Companys and its Subsidiaries as Subsidiaries of Parent) freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of their respective stores, businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any judgment, decree, ruling, injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order or judgment in any Action, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the Closing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent may enter into agreements with a Governmental Entity to delay for reasonable periods of time the consummation of the Merger, except that (i) no such agreement shall delay the consummation of the Merger to a date later than December 4, 2007; (ii) if, at the time of entering into 

   the agreement, it is reasonably likely that Parent, Merger Sub and/or the
Company, in the aggregate, would not be required to divest, sell, transfer
and/or otherwise dispose of, stores, businesses or other assets of Parent
and/or the Company or of any of their Subsidiaries with aggregated Allocated
Amounts in excess of the Threshold Amount in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then no such agreement shall be
entered without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); and (iii) prior to entering into any such
agreement, Parent shall provide the Company with not fewer than five Business
Days prior written notice of its intention to do so and during such period
Parent shall discuss with the Company such agreement and shall consider in
good faith any comments by the Company (which the Company shall promptly
provide) regarding such agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, prior to December 5, 2007, Parent shall not be
required to divest, sell, transfer and/or otherwise dispose of, stores,
businesses or other assets of Parent and/or the Company or of any of their
Subsidiaries with aggregated Allocated Amounts in excess of the Threshold
Amount, or enter into any agreement to do any of the foregoing. In no event
will Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to any adjustment to or diminution of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration.

  

 SECTION 6.7 _Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification; Excess Benefit Plans_. 

  

 (a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that all rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time existing in favor of any individual who, on or prior to the Effective Time, is or was a current or former officer or director of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company Indemnitees_ "), as provided in (i) the organizational documents of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement or (ii) any agreement providing for indemnification by any of the Company or its Subsidiaries of any Company Indemnitee in effect on the date of this Agreement to which any of the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound and which has been set forth in Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and continue in full force and effect and be honored by Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time. In addition, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, all of the benefits in respect of any employee to which the employee (or his or her beneficiaries) is entitled under the terms of the supplemental retirement and excess benefit plans and agreements set forth in Section 4.10(n) of the Company Disclosure Letter as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, and shall cause each of the Surviving Corporation and Parents Subsidiaries to, take all actions required by, and otherwise comply with, the provisions of this Section 6.7(a). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain, at Parents expense, "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance covering those directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were covered by the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policies and in amount and scope at least as favorable to such directors and officers as such existing policies for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the aggregate premiums for such policies do not exceed an amount equal to 300% of the current annual premium of the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance as in effect on the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) The Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification, except to the extent required by any applicable Law adopted, amended or reinterpreted after the date of this Agreement, than those set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws of the Company, respectively, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior 

   to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or
agents of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries. 

  

 (c) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7. 

  

 (d) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries under this Section 6.7 shall be joint and several. 

  

 (e) It is expressly agreed that the Company Indemnitees and each employee (and, if deceased, his or her heirs or beneficiaries) to whom this Section 6.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of the obligations to such persons set forth in this Section 6.7. The obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries under this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Company Indemnitee or employee (or, if deceased, his or her heirs of beneficiaries) to whom this Section applies under this Section 6.7 without the consent of such affected Person. 

  

 SECTION 6.8 _Access to Information_. 

  

 (a) From the date hereof to the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement, the Company shall, to the extent consistent with applicable Law (including Antitrust Law), afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other Facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to their books and records, and shall furnish Parent with available monthly (or more frequently during the Marketing Period) financial, operating and other data and information with respect to the business and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request (including daily working capital reports from the beginning of the Marketing Period until the Closing Date) (other than information concerning a Company Proposal or a Superior Proposal, each of which shall be governed by Section 6.3). In exercising its rights hereunder, Parent shall (and shall cause each of its Representatives to) conduct itself so as not to interfere in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to Closing. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that they and their Representatives shall not contact any officers, employees, landlords, tenants, licensees, franchisees, customers or agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries unless consented to by the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and that any contact hereunder shall be arranged and supervised by Representatives of the Company, unless the Company otherwise expressly consents with respect to any specific contact. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to disclose to Parent or any agent or Representative thereof any information (i) if doing so could violate any Contract to which the Company or any of its Affiliates is a party or Law to which the Company or any of its Affiliates is subject or (ii) which the Company or any of its Affiliates believes in good faith could result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of privilege (including the attorney-client and work product privileges); _provided_ that the Company shall seek to obtain any consent required under any such Contract to permit such disclosure; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Company or any of its Affiliates believes in good faith that any such disclosure may result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of privilege, the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and explore in good faith whether a method could be used to permit disclosure by the Company or its Representatives without waiving such privilege. 

   (b) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Parent shall, to the extent consistent with applicable Law (including Antitrust Law), afford the Company and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other Facilities of Parent and its Subsidiaries and to their books and records. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to disclose to the Company or any agent or Representative thereof any information (i) if doing so could violate any Contract to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party or Law to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is subject or (ii) which Parent or any of its Affiliates believes in good faith could result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of privilege (including the attorney-client and work product privileges); _provided_  that Parent shall seek to obtain any consent required under any such Contract to permit such disclosure; _provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent or any of its Affiliates believes in good faith that any such disclosure may result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of privilege, Parent and Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and explore in good faith whether a method could be used to permit disclosure by Parent or its Representatives without waiving such privilege. 

  

 (c) All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect pursuant to its terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that from and after the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement, the term "significant employee" (as defined in Section 9 of the Confidentiality Agreement) shall mean, with respect to either Parent or the Company, any assistant store manager. 

  

 SECTION 6.9 _Publicity_. Parent and the Company shall communicate with each other and cooperate with each other prior to any public disclosure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Company agree that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements shall be issued by either of them without the prior consent of the other, except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange upon which the securities of the Company or Parent, as applicable, are listed, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall consult with the other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time (taking into account the circumstances) to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. 

  

 SECTION 6.10 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement_. 

  

 (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a joint proxy statement(s)/prospectus(es) for the Company Stockholder Approval and the Parent Stockholder Approval (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the " _Joint Proxy Statement_ ") and (ii) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 in connection with the Share Issuance in the Merger (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the " _Form S-4_ "), in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause its respective counsel, accountants and other advisors to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (including causing accountants to deliver necessary or required instruments such as opinions, consents and certifications) and to keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete the Merger. The Company will cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders and Parent will cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Parents stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified, filing a general consent to service of process or subjecting itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction if it is not otherwise so subject) reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the Share Issuance in the Merger and the 

   receipt of the Preemptive Rights Charter Amendment, and the Company shall
furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of Company
Common Stock as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any
such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Joint Proxy
Statement and the Form S-4. The parties shall cooperate and notify each
other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments
or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or for additional
information, and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence
between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the
staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement, the Form S-4, the Merger, the Preemptive Rights Charter Amendment
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement will be
made by Parent or the Company, in each case without providing the other
parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company
or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers,
should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement,
so that any such document would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the
stockholders of the Company.

  

 (b) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys stockholders or Parents stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. The Form S-4 will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act. 

  

 (c) Parent may not include in the Joint Proxy Statement any proposals seeking shareholder approval, other than approval of the Share Issuance and the Preemptive Rights Charter Amendment. 

  

 SECTION 6.11 _Company Senior Subordinated Notes_. 

  

 (a) Unless otherwise requested by Parent pursuant to Section 6.11(b) below, the Company shall promptly at a time reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent, commence an offer to purchase, and a related consent solicitation (the " _Consent Solicitation_ "), with respect to any and all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes on price terms that are acceptable to Parent and such other customary terms and conditions (including selection of the dealer manager(s)) as are reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent to be consummated substantially simultaneously with the Closing using funds provided by Parent (including the related Consent Solicitation, the " _Debt Tender Offer_ "), and Parent shall assist the Company in connection therewith. The Company shall take all corporate actions necessary to effect the Debt Tender Offer and the Consent Solicitation. Promptly following the expiration date of the Consent Solicitation, assuming the requisite consents are received with 

   respect to the Existing Notes, the Company shall execute a supplemental
indenture to the indenture governing the Existing Notes (the " _Indenture_
"), amending the terms and provisions of the Indenture as reasonably
requested by Parent and as set forth in the Debt Tender Offer documents sent
to holders of the Existing Notes (which amendment may include the elimination
of all or substantially all of the covenants contained in the Existing Notes
or the Indenture which can be eliminated upon the favorable vote of the
holders of a majority of the principal amount thereof), which supplemental
indenture shall become operative immediately upon the Effective Time, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the trustee under the
Indenture to enter into such supplemental indenture prior to or substantially
simultaneously with the Closing. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with the Debt Tender Offer. The closing of the Debt
Tender Offer shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and the
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Debt Tender
Offer to close on the Closing Date; _provided_ that the consummation of the
Consent Solicitation and the Debt Tender Offer shall not be a condition to
Closing. Concurrent with the Effective Time, and in accordance with the terms
of the Debt Tender Offer, the Surviving Corporation shall accept for purchase
and purchase the Existing Notes properly tendered and not properly withdrawn
in the Debt Tender Offer using funds provided by or at the direction of
Parent. Parent hereby covenants and agrees to provide (or cause to be
provided) immediately available funds to the Company for the full payment at
the Effective Time of all the Existing Notes properly tendered and not
withdrawn to the extent required pursuant to the terms of the Consent
Solicitation or the Debt Tender Offer.

  

 (b) If requested by Parent in writing, in lieu of commencing a Debt Tender Offer for the Existing Notes, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the Existing Notes and the Indenture, (i) substantially simultaneous with the Effective Time issue a notice of optional redemption for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes, pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Indenture, and (ii) take any other actions reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the satisfaction and discharge of the Existing Notes pursuant to the satisfaction and discharge provisions of the Indenture and the other provisions of the Indenture applicable thereto; _provided_  that prior to the Companys being required to take any of the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) above, Parent shall have, or shall have caused to be, deposited with the trustee under the Indenture sufficient funds to effect such redemption and satisfaction and discharge. The redemption and satisfaction and discharge of the Existing Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to collectively as the " _Discharge_ " of the Existing Notes. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Discharge of the Existing Notes; _provided_ that the consummation of the Discharge shall not be a condition to Closing. 

  

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or Company pursuant to Section 8.1, then Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company to the extent resulting from its compliance with this Section 6.11. 

  

 (d) The Company shall be deemed to have satisfied each of its obligations set forth in clauses (a) through (c) of this Section 6.11 if the Company shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such obligations, regardless of the actual outcome of the Consent Solicitation, Debt Tender Offer or Discharge. 

  

 SECTION 6.12 _Affiliates_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all Persons who were, at the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such Person to deliver to Parent on or prior to the Closing 

   Date an agreement in the form set forth in Section 6.12 of the Company
Disclosure Letter relating to such Persons status as an affiliate of the

  |  

 (i)  the Outside Date is extended pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) and the Antitrust  Conditions are not satisfied prior to the extended Outside Date and Parent or  the Company has given notice to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section  8.1(b)(i), or 

   
   



  |  



   
   



  |  

 (ii)  this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iv) after March  4, 2008 and such Permanent Restraint has been entered at the request of any  Person seeking relief under Antitrust Laws,

 (k) The parties hereto agree that the provisions contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement as set forth in Sections 8.2(b) through (g) are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that the amounts payable pursuant to Sections 8.2(b) through (g) are reasonable forecasts of the actual damages which may be incurred by the parties under such circumstances. The amounts payable pursuant to Sections 8.2(b) through (g) constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and, except as provided in Section 8.3, shall be the sole monetary remedy in the event of termination of this Agreement on the basis specified in such Sections. Fees payable pursuant Section 8.2(h) or Section 8.2(i) shall be the non-exclusive remedy in the event of termination on the basis specified in such Sections, and payment of such amounts shall not relieve Parent from liability for any breach of this Agreement or prejudice the ability of the Company to seek additional damages for breach or to pursue any remedy at law or in equity. If either party fails to pay to the other party any amount due under Sections 8.2(b) through (i) on the date specified in Section 8.2(j), then the breaching party shall pay and reimburse the other party (i) for all costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented legal fees and expenses) of the other party in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment and (ii) interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published from time to time in _The Wall Street Journal_ , from the date such amount was required to be paid until the date actually received by the party entitled to such fee. 

  

 SECTION 8.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by a party pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall thereupon terminate and become void and have no effect, and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, except that (i) the provisions of Sections 4.18, 6.5(d), 6.8(c), 6.11(c), 8.1, 8.2, Article IX and this Section 8.3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the parties shall remain liable for any payments thereunder and obligated to comply with any agreements or covenants thereunder, (ii) such termination shall not relieve any party of any liability for any willful breach of this Agreement and (iii) upon such termination, the parties shall comply with all the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE IX

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

 SECTION 9.1 _Non-survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, shall survive the Closing Date, except for those covenants and agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the Closing Date. 

  

 SECTION 9.2 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. This Agreement and the rights hereunder are not assignable (whether by operation of law or otherwise) unless such assignment is consented to in writing by each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may without such consent, assign in writing, directly or indirectly, their or its respective rights (but not their or its respective obligations) hereunder to any of their or its respective wholly owned Subsidiaries ( _provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve such parties of their obligations hereunder); _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that Parent may assign its rights under this Agreement to a newly formed parent holding company, which will assume all of Parents obligations hereunder, in connection with Parents reorganization into a holding company structure ( _provided_ that no 

   such assignment shall require the approval of the stockholders of Parent,
otherwise materially impair or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or relieve Parent of its obligations under
this Agreement). Subject to the preceding clause, this Agreement and all the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 SECTION 9.3 _Choice of Law; Jurisdiction_. 

  

 (a) The Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all disputes between the parties under or related to this Agreement or the facts and circumstances leading to its execution, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to conflict of laws principles. 

  

 (b) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or any federal court located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of or relates to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of such Action may be heard and determined in any such court; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that it will not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware; and (v) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any Action related to or arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought. Each of the parties further agrees to waive any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with respect to any action or proceeding, including an appeal thereof. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices by registered mail in Section 9.4. Nothing in this Section 9.3(b), however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. 

  

 SECTION 9.4 _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) if delivered personally, when received, (b) if sent by cable, telecopy, telegram, email or facsimile (which is confirmed by the intended recipient), when sent, (c) if sent by overnight courier service, on the next Business Day after being sent, or (d) if mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, with postage prepaid, five Business Days after being deposited in the mail, to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):

 SECTION 9.5 _Headings_. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be considered in interpreting or construing any of the provisions contained in this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the parties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the foregoing shall supersede the terms and provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive and remain in effect until expiration or termination thereof in accordance with its terms. 

  

 SECTION 9.7 _Interpretation_. 

  

 (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. 

      
--- 
   

 (b)  Whenever the words "include," "includes" and "including" are used in this  Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."  

   
   



   
   

 (c)  When a reference in this Agreement is made to a "party" or "parties," such  reference shall be to a party or parties to this Agreement unless otherwise  indicated. 

   
   



   
   

 (d)  Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "hereof," "herein,"  "hereby," "hereunder," "hereto" and derivative or similar words in this  Agreement refer to this entire Agreement. 

   
   



   
   

 (e)  Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "hereof and thereof,"  "herein and therein," "hereby and thereby," "hereunder and thereunder,"  "hereto and thereto" and derivative or similar pairings of words in this  Agreement refer to this entire Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. 

   
   



   
   

 (f)  Unless the context requires otherwise, the term "knowledge" means (i) with  respect to the Company, the actual knowledge (without investigation) of the  Persons listed in Section 9.7(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter and (ii)  with respect to Parent and/or Merger Sub, the actual knowledge (without  investigation) of the Persons listed in Section 9.7(f) of the Parent  Disclosure Letter. 

   
   



   
   

 (g)  Unless the context requires otherwise, words in this Agreement using the  singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number,  respectively, and the use of any gender herein shall be deemed to include the  other genders. 

   
   



   
   

 (h)  References in this Agreement to "dollars" or "$" are to U.S. dollars. 

   
   



   
   

 (i)  Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, where any action is  required to be taken on a particular day and such day is not a Business Day  and, as a result, such action cannot be taken on such day, then this  Agreement shall be deemed to provide that such action shall be taken on the  first Business Day after such day. 

   
   



   
   

 (j)  This Agreement was prepared jointly by the parties and no rule that it be  construed against the drafter will have any application in its construction  or interpretation. 

   
   

 SECTION 9.8 _Waiver and Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a written mutual agreement executed and delivered by the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the holders of Company Common Stock or holders of Parent Common Stock without such approval having been obtained. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of any party to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. 

  

 SECTION 9.9 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which, when executed, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument binding upon all of the parties notwithstanding the fact that all of the parties are not signatory to the original or the same counterpart. For purposes of this Agreement, facsimile signatures shall be deemed originals. 

  

 SECTION 9.10 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein express or implied shall give or be 

   construed to give to any Person, other than the parties and such successors
and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder and except
that each Company Indemnitee and employee (or if deceased, his or her heirs
or beneficiaries) shall have the right to enforce the obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation to such Persons solely with respect to and as
set forth in Section 6.7.

  

 SECTION 9.11 _Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur for which no adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy at Law or in equity., without the necessity of posting bonds or other undertaking in connection therewith. The parties acknowledge that in the absence of a waiver, a bond or undertaking may be required by a court and the parties hereby waive any such requirement of such a bond or undertaking. 

  

 SECTION 9.12 _Severability_. If any term, covenant, restriction or provision of this Agreement or the application of any such term, covenant, restriction or provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term, covenant, restriction or provision hereof so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. The parties shall engage in good faith negotiations to replace any term, covenant, restriction or provision which is declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable with a valid, legal and enforceable term, covenant, restriction or provision, the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable term, covenant, restriction or provision which it replaces. 

   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed the day and year first above written.
