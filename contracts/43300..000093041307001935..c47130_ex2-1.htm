The Company shall appoint American Stock Transfer and Trust Company to be the

the Per Share Merger Consideration for certificates formerly representing
Company Common Stock. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall

to the Aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of all shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger and authorize
the Exchange Agent to issue shares of Parent Common Stock upon the exchange of
certificates formerly representing Company Common Stock therefor. Promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent
to send, to each holder of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the certificates formerly representing Company
Common Stock to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. </FONT> </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a certificate formerly
representing Company Common Stock, together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, payable for
each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such certificate.
Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such certificate
shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to

If any portion of the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration is to be paid
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered certificate
formerly representing Company Common Stock is registered, it shall be a
condition to such payment that (i) either such certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any Transfer Taxes or
other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. </FONT></P>

No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, and
fractional share interests of Parent Common Stock shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. For
purposes of this Section 3.2(d), the fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
of a single record holder shall be determined after aggregating all
certificates and shares of such holder and calculations shall be rounded to
five decimal places. Each holder who would otherwise be entitled to receive

Any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 3.2(a) (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Common Stock 180 days
after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such

3.2 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving

such certificates formerly representing Company Common Stock without any
interest thereon, but such holders shall have no greater rights against Parent
and the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto than are accorded to general
creditors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall not be liable to any holder of certificates formerly representing
Company Common Stock for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. If any certificates
formerly representing Company Common Stock have not been surrendered prior to

earlier date on which any Per Share Merger Consideration or any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section
3.2(h) in respect of such certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity), any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and

Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the

withholding were made. </FONT> </P>

Law, following surrender of any such certificate, there shall be paid to the
holder of the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of

Subject to Section 6.3(b), from and after the date hereof through the earlier
of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
authorize or permit any of their Representatives to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate the submission of any Company
Proposal; (ii) enter into, initiate or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to,
otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or knowingly encourage any
effort by any Third Party or 13D Group that is seeking to make, or has made, or
may reasonably be expected to make, a Company Proposal; (iii) grant any waiver
or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of
equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than a
standstill provision contained in a confidentiality agreement entered into with
such Person pursuant to Section 6.3(b)(ii); or (iv) enter into any agreement
with respect to a Company Proposal other than a confidentiality agreement
permitted by Section 6.3(b).  The
Company shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Representatives of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions and negotiations, if any, with any Third Party
or 13D Group conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Company
Proposal and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such
Third Party or 13D Group (or its agents or advisors) in possession of
confidential information about the Company that was furnished by or on behalf
of the Company prior to the date hereof to return or destroy all such information.  Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.3(a) by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such
Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.3(a) by the
Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company receives a Company Proposal that
was not solicited, or knowingly encouraged or facilitated, by the Company in
violation of Section 6.3(a), and which either constitutes a Superior Proposal
or which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, would reasonably
be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failing to take such action described in clause (i) or (ii) below
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then,
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company, directly
or indirectly through its Representatives, may (i) engage in negotiations or
discussions (including the solicitation of a revised Company Proposal) with
such Third Party or 13D Group and (ii) furnish to such Third Party or 13D Group
and its attorneys, auditors, advisors and financing sources non-public
information relating to, and afford such Third Party or 13D Group access to,
the business, properties, assets, books and records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement no less favorable to
the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement.  The Company shall provide as promptly as practicable, to Parent
any material information provided to such Third Party or 13D Group that has not
previously been provided to Parent.
Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the
Company from complying with Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act
with regard to a Company Proposal, or from making any other legally required
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company with regard to the Company
Proposal under federal securities Laws, the regulations of any national
securities exchange on which the Company Common Stock is listed or as required
under Delaware Law.  For the avoidance
of doubt, for all purposes under this Agreement, including Article VIII, any
disclosure by the Board of Directors of the status of any Company Proposal
(without comment on the merits thereof) or any stop-look-listen communication
under Rule 14d-9(f) shall not, in and of itself, be considered an Adverse
Recommendation Change or a violation of this Section 6.3. </FONT></P>

From the date hereof to the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this

(including Antitrust Law), afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the officers,
employees, agents, properties, offices and other Facilities of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and to their books and records, and shall furnish Parent with
available monthly (or more frequently during the Marketing Period) financial,
operating and other data and information with respect to the business and properties
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request (including
daily working capital reports from the beginning of the Marketing Period until
the Closing Date) (other than information concerning a Company Proposal or a
Superior Proposal, each of which shall be governed by Section 6.3).  In exercising its rights hereunder, Parent
shall (and shall cause each of its Representatives to) conduct itself so as not
to interfere in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
prior to Closing.  Parent and Merger Sub

agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries unless consented to by the Company
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and that any contact
hereunder shall be arranged and supervised by Representatives of the Company,
unless the Company otherwise expressly consents with respect to any specific contact.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall be
required to disclose to Parent or any agent or Representative thereof any
information (i) if doing so could violate any Contract to which the Company or
any of its Affiliates is a party or Law to which the Company or any of its
Affiliates is subject or (ii) which the Company or any of its Affiliates
believes in good faith could result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert
a claim of privilege (including the attorney-client and work product
privileges); <U>provided</U> that the Company shall seek to obtain any consent
required under any such Contract to permit such disclosure; <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>,
that if the Company or any of its Affiliates believes in good faith that any
such disclosure may result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a
claim of privilege, the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate and explore in good faith whether a method could be used
to permit disclosure by the Company or its Representatives without waiving such
privilege. </FONT></P>

9.8 <U>Waiver and Amendment</U>.  This
Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a written mutual
agreement executed and delivered by the parties hereto; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>,
that there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by
the holders of Company Common Stock or holders of Parent Common Stock without
such approval having been obtained.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of any party
to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be
waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written
instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.  The failure of any party to
this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION
9.9 <U>Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures</U>.
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which, when executed, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument binding upon all of
the parties notwithstanding the fact that all of the parties are not signatory
to the original or the same counterpart.
For purposes of this Agreement, facsimile signatures shall be deemed
originals. </FONT></P>

Indemnitee and employee (or if deceased, his or her heirs or beneficiaries)
shall have the right to enforce the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation to such Persons solely with respect to and as set forth in Section
6.7. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION
9.11 <U>Specific Performance</U>.
Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.  The
parties agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
irreparable damage would occur for which no adequate remedy at Law would exist
and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions and specific performance of the terms
hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy at Law or in equity.,
without the necessity of posting bonds or other undertaking in connection
therewith.  The parties acknowledge that
in the absence of a waiver, a bond or undertaking may be required by a court
and the parties hereby waive any such requirement of such a bond or
undertaking. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION
9.12 <U>Severability</U>.  If any term,
covenant, restriction or provision of this Agreement or the application of any
such term, covenant, restriction or provision to any Person or circumstance
shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of
competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall
not affect any other term, covenant, restriction or provision hereof so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.  The parties shall engage in good faith
negotiations to replace any term, covenant, restriction or provision which is
declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable with a valid, legal and enforceable
term, covenant, restriction or provision, the economic effect of which comes as
close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable term,
covenant, restriction or provision which it replaces. </FONT></P>
