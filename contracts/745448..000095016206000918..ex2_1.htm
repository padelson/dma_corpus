ARTICLE  I

 

 

_The  Merger_

 

 

SECTION  1.01. _The  Merger._   On the  terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in  accordance with the Delaware

1.03). At the Effective Time, the separate corporate  existence of
Acquisition Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as  the 
surviving corporation (the " _Surviving  Corporation_ ").  The  Merger, the
payment of cash in connection with the Merger and the other  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction  Agreements, other
than the TM Distribution, are referred to in this Agreement  collectively as
the " _Transactions_ ".  At the  election of Parent, any direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent with no or  nominal assets and no liabilities may be
substituted for Acquisition Sub as  a  constituent corporation in the
Merger. In such event, the parties shall execute  an appropriate amendment to
this Agreement in order to reflect the  foregoing.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

SECTION  1.02. _Closing._   The  closing (the " _Closing_ ")  of the 
Merger shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825
Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at a  mutually agreeable time during
Tokyo business hours on the second business  day  following the satisfaction
(or, to the extent permitted by Law as defined in  Section 3.05, waiver by
all parties) of the conditions set forth in  Section 7.01, or, if on such day
any condition set forth in  Section 7.02 or 7.03 has not been satisfied (or,
to the extent permitted by  Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to
the benefits thereof), as soon  as practicable after all the conditions set
forth in Article VII have been  satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by
Law, waived by the parties entitled  to  the benefits thereof), or at such
other place, time and date as shall be agreed  in writing between Parent and
the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs  is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing  Date_ ".

 

 

SECTION  1.03. _Effective  Time._   Prior to  the Closing, Parent and the
Company shall prepare, and on the Closing Date  or as  soon as practicable
thereafter Parent and the Company shall file with the  Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger or other  appropriate
documents (in any such case, the " _Certificate  of Merger_ ")  executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make  all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become 
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such 
Secretary of State, or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall
agree  and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective  being the " _Effective  Time_ ").

 

 

SECTION  1.04. _Effects  of the Merger._   The  Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 259 of the  DGCL.

 

 

SECTION  1.05. _Certificate  of Incorporation and By-laws._ (a)  The 
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended 
at  the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit A, and, as so
amended,  such Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation  of  the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided  therein or by applicable Law.

 

 

(b)  The  By-laws of Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective  Time  and as heretofore provided to the Company shall be the By-
laws of the Surviving  Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by  applicable Law.

 

 

SECTION  1.06. _Directors._   The  directors of Acquisition Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall  be  the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their  resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected  and  qualified, as the
case may be.

 

 

SECTION  1.07. _Officers._   The  officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the  officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 


 

earlier  of  their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly  elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

 

 

 

ARTICLE  II

 

 

_Effect  of  the  Merger on the Capital Stock of the_

 

_Constituent  Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_

 

 

SECTION  2.01. _Effect  on Capital Stock._   At the  Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part  of  the holder of
any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of common stock  of
Acquisition Sub:

 

 

(a)  _Capital  Stock of Acquisition Sub._   Each  issued and outstanding
share of common stock of Acquisition Sub shall be  converted into and become
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common  stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(b)  _Cancelation  of Treasury Stock and Parent- Owned Stock._   Each 
share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent,
Acquisition  Sub or any subsidiary thereof shall no longer be outstanding and
shall  automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no  consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange  therefor.

 

 

(c)  _Conversion  of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock._ (i)
Subject  to Sections 2.01(b), 2.01(c)(ii) and 2.01(d), (1) each issued share
of  Company Common Stock owned by a Principal Company Stockholder shall be
converted  into the right to receive $2.1833 in cash (such amount per share
of Company  Common Stock, the " _PCS_ _Common  Merger Consideration_ "), 
(2) each other issued share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into 
the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the greater of (A) $2.40  and
(B) the product of (x) the Common Price Ratio (as defined below)  and (y)
$2.40 (such greater amount per share of Company Common Stock, the " _Common 
Merger Consideration_ "),  (3) each issued share of Series A Company
Preferred Stock (as defined  below) shall be converted into the right to
receive in cash the quotient of  (x) $44,893,310 divided by (y) the number of
such issued shares,  (4) each issued share of Series A-1 Company Preferred
Stock (as  defined below) shall be converted into the right to receive in
cash the quotient  of $53,106,702 divided by (y) the number of such issued
shares and  (5) each issued share of Series B Company Preferred Stock (as
defined  below) shall be converted into the right to receive in cash the
quotient of  (x) $23,893,135 divided by (y) the number of such issued 
shares.

 

 

(ii) In  the  event that any cash payment will be due following the
Effective Time from the  Company to a holder of a Company Stock Option
pursuant to Section 6.04  (after taking into account any such holder that

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 


 

irrevocably  waives his or her right to any such payment), the PCS Common
Merger  Consideration and the Common Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately  adjusted (pro rata, on a per share basis) so that the
aggregate amount of the  Merger Consideration and such payment or payments
following such adjustment  equals the amount of the Merger Consideration
(excluding any such payment or  payments) prior to such adjustment.

 

 

(iii) For  purposes of this Agreement: (1) " _Common  Price Ratio_
" means  a  fraction equal the quotient of (x) the Closing Common Price
divided by  (y) the Signing Common Price, (2) " _Signing  Common Price_
" means  $1.9282 and (3) " _Closing  Common Price_ " means  the average
of the closing prices in Japanese yen of a share of Common Stock  of  the
Parent on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (" _TSE_ ")  for the  thirty trading day
period ending on the second business day prior to the Closing  Date,
converted into U.S. dollars at the 4:00 p.m., New York time, exchange  rate
of Japanese yen to U.S. dollars published by the Wall Street Journal (New 
York City edition) on the second business day immediately prior to the
Closing  Date.

 

 

(iv) The  cash  payable upon the conversion of shares of Company Common
Stock and Company  Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 2.01(c) is
referred to  collectively as the " _Merger  Consideration_ ".  As of  the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock and Company 
Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be 
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing  any such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock shall cease  to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the  applicable Merger Consideration, without interest, upon
surrender of such  certificate in accordance with this Section 2.01 and 
Section 2.02.

 

 

(d)  _Appraisal  Rights._   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares  (" _Appraisal  Shares_ ")  of  Company Common Stock
and Company Preferred Stock that are outstanding  immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by any person who  is  entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such Appraisal Shares  pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL  (" _Section 262_") 
shall  not be converted into Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.01(c),  but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to
payment of  the  fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with
Section 262;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that if  any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or  lose  the right to
appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to  be paid the
fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares shall cease and such  Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective  Time 
into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive,
Merger  Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall
serve  prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal  of  any shares of Company Common Stock or

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Company  Preferred Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in
and direct  all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the  Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of  Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any  such  demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

 

SECTION  2.02. _Exchange  of Certificates._ (a)  _Paying  Agent._  
Prior to  the Effective Time, Parent shall, with the Company's consent not to
be  unreasonably withheld, select a bank or trust company to act as paying
agent  for  the payment of the Merger Consideration to the Principal Company
Stockholders  and to the holders of the Company Preferred Stock (the " _PCS 
Paying Agent_ ")  and a  second bank or trust company to act as paying agent
for the payment of the  Merger Consideration to the other common stockholders
of the Company (the " _Other  Paying Agent_ " and,  together with the PCS
Paying Agent, the " _Paying  Agents_ "),  in  each case upon surrender of
certificates representing Company Common Stock  or  Company Preferred Stock.
Parent, on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, shall  provide to the PCS
Paying Agent at the Effective Time in immediately available  funds all the
cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock  of  the
Principal Company Stockholders and the shares of the Company Preferred 
Stock  of the holders thereof and shall provide to the Other Paying Agent at
the  Effective Time in immediately available funds all the cash necessary to
pay  for  the shares of Company Common Stock of the other stockholders of
the Company,  in  each case such shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock having  been converted into the right to receive cash
pursuant to Section 2.01(c)  (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
" _Exchange  Fund_ ").

 

 

(b)  _Exchange  Procedure._   With  respect to the Company Common Stock
of the Principal Company Stockholders and  the Company Preferred Stock of the
holders thereof, not less than  two business days prior to the Closing Date
the PCS Paying Agent shall mail  or otherwise deliver to each Principal
Company Stockholder or holder of Company  Preferred Stock that is a holder of
record of certificate or certificates (the  " _Certificates_ ")  that 
immediately prior to the Effective Time will represent outstanding shares of 
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock whose shares will be
converted  into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to 
Section 2.01, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that  delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates  shall 
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the PCS Paying Agent and
shall  be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify)  and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the  Certificates at the Effective Time in exchange for Merger
Consideration. With  respect to the other Company Common Stock, as soon as
reasonably practicable  after the Effective Time, the Other Paying Agent
shall mail to each other holder  of record of a Certificate or Certificates
that immediately prior to the  Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock whose  shares were converted into the right to
receive Merger Consideration pursuant  to  Section 2.01, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that  delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates  shall

pass,  only  upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall
be in such  form  and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and  (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in  exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for  cancelation to the applicable Paying Agent, together with
such letter of  transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be  required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled  to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into
which the shares of  Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
theretofore represented by  such  Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.01, and the  Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. In the event of a  transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the  transfer records of the Company, payment may
be made to a person other than  the  person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such  Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for  transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other  taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered  holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that  such  tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by  this Section 2.02, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the  Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the  amount of cash,
without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock  or Company
Preferred Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have  been 
converted pursuant to Section 2.01. No interest shall be paid or accrue on 
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 

 

(c)  _No  Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._   The 
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II 
upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred 
Stock  shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining  to such shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock and after  the  Effective Time there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock  transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock  or  Company Preferred Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any certificates formerly representing  shares of Company Common Stock
are presented to the Surviving Corporation or  a  Paying Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided  in  this Article
II.

 

 

(d)  _Termination  of Exchange Fund._   Any  portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of  Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock for twelve months after the  Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of  Company Common Stock who
has not theretofore complied with this Article II  shall thereafter look only
to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment  of its claim for Merger
Consideration.

 

 

(e)  _No  Liability._   None of  Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or
the Paying Agents shall be liable to  any  person in respect of any cash
from the Exchange

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Fund  properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned  property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been
surrendered  prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such  earlier date on which Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate would  otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity (as  defined in Section 3.05), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions  in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable  Law,  become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims  or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

 

 

(f)  _Investment  of Exchange Fund._   The Other  Paying Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund held by it,  as  directed by
Parent, in (i) direct obligations of the United States of  America, (ii)
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United  States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of all principal and  interest
or (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating  from
either Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's, a  division of
The McGraw Hill Companies, or a combination thereof; _provided_   that, in 
any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three
months  from the date of the investment therein. Any interest and other
income resulting  from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

 

 

(g)  _Withholding  Rights._   Parent  and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from  the  consideration otherwise
payable to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company  Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required  to be  deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the  Code  (as
defined in Section 3.09), or under any provision of Federal, state,  local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid  over to
the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, such withheld amounts shall  be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holders  of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock in
respect  of  which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

 

 

(h)  _Lost  Certificates._   If any  Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making  of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be  lost,  stolen, defaced or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving  Corporation, the
posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount  as  the
Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may 
be  made against it with respect to such Certificate, the applicable Paying
Agent  shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
Certificate  the  Merger Consideration with respect to each share of Company
Common Stock formerly  represented by such Certificate.

_Representations  and Warranties of the Company_

 

 

The  Company represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition Sub that,
except  as  set forth in the letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement,
from the  Company to Parent and Acquisition Sub (the " _Company  Disclosure
Letter_ ")  ( _provided_   that,  unless the context indicates or requires
otherwise, (i) the representations  and warranties contained herein are made
giving effect to the proposed  distribution to all the holders of the Company
Common Stock of the Company's  equity interests in TriMas Corporation as
described in Exhibit B (the " _TM  Distribution_ "),  as if  the
consummation of the TM Distribution had occurred prior to the date hereof, 
(ii) none of these representations and warranties, other than  Sections 3.05,
3.06, 3.07, 3.12, 3.13 and 3.18, shall relate to TriMas  Corporation) and
(iii) to the extent that Sections 3.06, 3.07, 3.12,  and 3.13 relate to
TriMas Corporation, such Sections shall only relate to the  Company's
ownership of securities of TriMas Corporation and any liabilities

the  jurisdiction in which it is organized and has full corporate power and 
authority, except, in the case of the Company Subsidiaries that are not 
Significant Company Subsidiaries (as defined below), where the failure to be 
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing, individually or in
the  aggregate, has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have a
material  adverse effect on the Company (a " _Company  Material Adverse
Effect_ ").  The  Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to
do business in each  jurisdiction where the nature of its business or their
ownership or leasing  of  its properties make such qualification necessary
or the failure to so qualify  has had or would be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.  The Company has made available to Parent
true and complete copies of the  certificates of incorporation of the
Company, as amended to the date of this  Agreement (as so amended, the "
_Company  Charter_ "),  and  the By-laws of the Company, as amended to the

more Company Subsidiaries or by the Company and another  Company Subsidiary,
free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges, mortgages,  rights of

first  refusal, options, restrictions (other than restrictions imposed under
applicable  Law), leases, licenses, easements, encumbrances and security
interests of any  kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ "). 
The  Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the
certificate  of incorporation and by-laws, or comparable charter and
organizational  documents, of each Significant Company Subsidiary, in each
case amended through  the date of this Agreement. For purposes of this

the Company that constitutes a significant subsidiary within  the meaning of
Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and  Exchange Commission ("
_SEC_ ").

 

 

(b)  Except  for  its interests in the Company Subsidiaries, the Company
does not as of the date  of this Agreement own, directly or indirectly, any
capital stock, membership  interest, partnership interest, joint venture
interest or other equity interest  with a fair market value in excess of
$2,000,000 in any  person.

 

 

SECTION  3.03. _Capital  Structure._ (a)  The  authorized capital stock
of the Company consists of 250,000,000 shares of  Company Common Stock and
25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value  $1.00 per share ("
_Company  Preferred Stock_ " and,  together with the Company Common Stock,

Company Preferred Stock (the " _Series  A Company Preferred Stock_ "), 
644,540 shares of Series A-1 Company Preferred Stock (the " _Series A-1 
Company Preferred Stock_"),  and  184,153 shares of Series B Company
Preferred Stock (the " _Series  B Company Preferred Stock_ ")  were  issued
and outstanding, (ii) no shares of Company Common Stock were held by  the
Company in its treasury and (iii) 3,251,342 shares of Company Common  Stock
were subject to outstanding Company Stock Options (as defined in  Section
6.04), 111,844 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to  contracts to
issue Company Stock Options, 48,797 shares of Company Common  Stock were
subject to outstanding Company RSUs (as defined in Section 6.04)  and

$3.00 and the weighted  average exercise price of all Company Stock Options
was equal to $9.37 per  share (without giving effect to any adjustment to the

shares of Company Common  Stock are, and all such shares that may be issued
prior to the Effective Time  will be when issued, duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and  nonassessable and not subject to or issued in
violation of any purchase option,  call option, right of first refusal,
preemptive right, subscription right or  any  similar right under any
provision of the DGCL, the Company Charter, the Company  By-laws or any

otherwise bound. There are not any bonds, debentures,

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 


 

notes  or  other indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or
convertible  into,  or exchangeable for, securities having the right to
vote) on any matters on  which holders of Company Common Stock may vote ("
_Voting  Company Debt_ ").  Except  as set forth above, there are not any
options, warrants, rights, convertible  or  exchangeable securities,
"phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights,  stock-based performance
units, commitments, Contracts, arrangements or  undertakings of any kind to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is  a  party or by which any of
them is bound (i) obligating the Company or any  Company Subsidiary to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered  or sold, additional shares
of capital stock or other equity interests in, or  any  security convertible
or exercisable for or exchangeable into any capital stock  of or other equity
interest in, the Company or of any Company Subsidiary or  any  Voting
Company Debt, (ii) obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary  to
issue, grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, 
security, commitment, Contract, arrangement or undertaking or (iii) that 
give any person the right to receive any economic benefit or right similar 
to or  derived from the economic benefits and rights occurring to holders of
Company  Common Stock. There are not any outstanding contractual obligations
of the  Company or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire  any  shares of capital stock of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

 

 

(b)  Section 3.03(b)  of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
complete and correct list  of  all outstanding Company Stock Options and
Company RSUs, the number of shares  of  Company Common Stock subject to each
such Company Stock Option and Company  RSU,  the grant date, exercise price
(as applicable), expiration date and vesting  schedule of each such Company
Stock Option and Company RSU and the names of  the  holders of each Company
Stock Option and Company RSU. All outstanding Company  Stock Options and
Company RSUs are evidenced by the Company Stock Option or  Company RSU
agreements set forth in Section 3.03(b) of the Company  Disclosure Letter,
and no Company Stock Option agreement or Company RSU  agreement contains
terms that are inconsistent with, or in addition to, the  terms contained
therein.

 

 

(c)  All  Company Stock Options and Company RSUs may, by their terms, be
treated as  provided for in Section 6.04.

 

 

SECTION  3.04. _Authority;  Execution and Delivery; Enforceability._

 

 

(a)  The  Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver  this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements to which it is a
party and to  consummate the Transactions to which it is a party. The
execution and delivery  by the Company of this Agreement and each of the
Transaction Agreements to  which  it is a party and the consummation by the
Company of the Transactions to which  it is a party have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action on  the  part of the Company, subject, in
the case of the Merger, to receipt of the  Company Stockholder Approval. The
Company has duly executed and delivered this  Agreement, and each Transaction
Agreement to which it is a party and this  Agreement and each Transaction

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Agreement  to which it is a party, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery  thereof by the other parties hereto and thereto, constitutes
its legal, valid  and binding obligation, enforceable against it in
accordance with its  terms.

 

 

(b)  The  Board  of Directors of the Company (the " _Company  Board_
"),  at a  meeting duly called and held duly and unanimously adopted
resolutions  (i) approving this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, the  Merger and the other Transactions, (ii) determining that the
terms of the  Merger and the other Transactions are fair to and in the best
interests of  the  stockholders of the Company, (iii) directing that this
Agreement be  submitted to a vote of the Company's stockholders, (iv)
recommending that  the Company's stockholders adopt   this  Agreement and
(v) declaring that this Agreement is advisable. Such  resolutions are
sufficient to render inapplicable to Parent and Acquisition  Sub,  this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, and the Merger and the  other
Transactions the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in 
Section 203 of the DGCL to the extent it is applicable. To the Company's 
knowledge, no other state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation 
applies or purports to apply to the Company with respect to this Agreement 
and  the other Transaction Agreements, the Merger or any other  Transaction.

 

 

(c)  The  only  consent or vote of holders of any class or series of
Company Capital Stock  necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the
Merger is the adoption  of  this Agreement by the holders of a majority of
the outstanding Company Common  Stock (the " _Company  Stockholder Approval_
"),  which  may be effected either by the written consent or the affirmative
vote at a  stockholders meeting of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Company  Common Stock. The written consent or affirmative vote of
the holders of Company  Capital Stock, or any of them, is not necessary to
approve any Transaction  Agreement other than this Agreement or to consummate
any Transaction other  than  the Merger.

 

 

SECTION  3.05. _No  Conflicts; Consents._ (a)  The  execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement and each Transaction  Agreement to
which it is a party do not, and the consummation of the Merger  and  the
other Transactions to which it is a party and compliance with and 
performance of the terms hereof and thereof will not, conflict with, or
result  in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or  both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation or
acceleration  of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or to
increased,  additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of
any person  under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or  assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under, any
provision of  (i) the Company Charter, the Company By-laws or the comparable
charter or  organizational documents of any Significant Company Subsidiary,
(ii) any  contract, lease, license, indenture, note, bond, agreement, permit,
concession,  franchise or other instrument (a " _Contract_ ")  to  which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their 
respective properties or assets is

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 


 

bound  or  (iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in 
Section 3.05(b), any material judgment, order or decree (" _Judgment_ ") 
or  statute, law (including common law), ordinance, rule or regulation  ("
_Law_ ")  applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their
respective  properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii)  above, any such items that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had  and  would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect  (excluding for purposes of this Section 3.05(a) and the application
of  Section 7.02(a) hereto, clause (a)(iii) of the definition "material 
adverse effect").

 

 

(b)  No  consent, approval, license, permit, order or authorization ("
_Consent_ ")  of, or  registration, declaration or filing with, or permit
from, any Federal, state,  local or foreign government or any court of
competent jurisdiction,  administrative agency or commission or other
governmental authority or  instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a "
_Governmental  Entity_ ")  is  required to be obtained or made by or with
respect to the Company or any Company  Subsidiary in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this  Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement to which it is a party, the consummation  of the Transactions to
which it is a party, other than (i) compliance with  and filings under (A)
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of  1976, as amended (the "
_HSR  Act_ "),  (B) Japanese Anti-Monopoly Law (Law No. 54 of 1947, as
amended),  (the " _Japanese  Anti-Monopoly Law_ "),  (C) other Antitrust

an information or proxy statement  with respect to the Merger and the 280G

connection with the Parent Stock Purchase Agreement, the other Transaction 
Agreements, the Parent Stock Acquisition and the other Transactions,  (iv)

in  the  Transactions or (B) that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had  and would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect  (excluding for purposes of this Section 3.05(b) and the
application of  Section 7.02(a) hereto, clause (a)(iii) of the definition
"material  adverse effect").

 

 

SECTION  3.06. _SEC  Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities._ (a)  The 
Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents  required to be filed by the Company with the SEC since January 3,
2005,  pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act (the "
_Company  SEC Documents_ ").

 

 

(b) As  of its respective date, each Company SEC Document complied in all
material  respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act of  1933, as amended (the " _Securities  Act_ "),  as the 
case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder 
applicable to such Company SEC Document, and did not contain any untrue 
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be 
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light  of  the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
consolidated  financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC
Documents comply  as of their respective dates as to form in all material
respects with applicable  accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC  with  respect thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") 
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of 
the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except 
as  may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present the
consolidated  financial position of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the  dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows  for the periods shown (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal  year-end audit adjustments and lack of
footnote disclosure as permitted by  Form 10-Q of the SEC).

 

 

(c)  Except  as  set forth in the most recent audited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company  (including the notes thereto) included in the Filed
Company SEC Documents (as  defined in Section 3.08) and except for

since the date of such balance  sheet, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has any liabilities or  obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)  required by GAAP to be set forth
on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company  and its consolidated
subsidiaries or in the notes thereto that, individually  or  in the
aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse 
Effect.

 

 

(d)  With  respect to each Company SEC Document that is a report on Form
10-K or 10-Q  or an amendment thereto, the Company is in compliance in all
material respects  with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
in effect from time  to time.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(e)  The  effectiveness of any additional disclosure requirement or
applicable accounting  rule, consensus or pronouncement that as of the date
of this Agreement has  been  adopted by the SEC, Financial Accounting
Standards Board or any similar body  but  that is not yet in effect, is not
reasonably likely to lead to any material  change in the Company's
disclosures as set forth in the Filed Company SEC  Documents.

reference in the Information Statement or any other document  (including
Schedule 13e-3) required to be filed by the Company with the SEC  relating to
the Transactions, including the Merger (together with the  Information
Statement, the " _Company  Disclosure Documents_ ")  will  contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material  fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements 
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not 
misleading. The Company Disclosure Documents will comply as to form in all 
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and  regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made by the
Company  with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
or omitted  therefrom based on information supplied by Parent or Acquisition
Sub in writing  for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

 

 

SECTION  3.08. _Absence  of Certain Changes or Events._ (a)  From  the 
date of the most recent audited financial statements included in the Company 
SEC  Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement  (the " _Filed  Company SEC Documents_ ")  to the  date of this
Agreement, the Company has conducted its business only in the  ordinary

likely to earn  annual base compensation and bonuses in 2006 of $200,000 or
more (any such  current director or officer of the Company or other employee

SECTION  3.11. _ERISA  Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments._

 

 

(a)  Section 3.11(a)  of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete
and correct list of all  Company Benefit Plans that are "employee pension
benefit plans" (as defined in  Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as  amended (" _ERISA_ "))  (a " _Company  Pension
Plan_ ")  or "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA) and  all other material Company Benefit Plans. The Company has
delivered or made  available to Parent complete and correct copies of (i)
each such Company  Benefit Plan and each material Company Benefit Agreement
(or, in the case of  any  such Company Benefit Plan or material Company
Benefit Agreement that is  unwritten, a written description thereof), (ii)
the two most recent annual  reports required to be filed, or such similar
reports, statements, information  returns or material correspondence required
to be filed with or delivered to  any  Governmental Entity, with respect to
each material Company Benefit Plan  (including reports filed on Form 5500
with accompanying schedules and  attachments), (iii) the most recent summary
plan description for each  material Company Benefit Plan for which a summary
plan description is required  under applicable Law, and any summary of
material modifications prepared for  each material Company Benefit Plan, (iv)
each trust agreement and group  annuity or insurance contract and other
documents relating to the funding or  payment of benefits under any material
Company Benefit Plan, (v) the most  recent determination or qualification
letter issued by any Governmental Entity  for each Company Benefit Plan
intended to qualify for favorable tax treatment  for which such a letter has
been obtained, as well as a true, correct and  complete copy of each pending
application therefor, if applicable, and  (vi) the two most recent actuarial
valuations for each material Company  Benefit Plan for which actuarial
valuations have been obtained.

 

 

(b)  Each  Company Benefit Plan has been administered in compliance with
its terms, and  each Company Benefit Plan (and the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with  respect to such plans) is in compliance with applicable
Law, including ERISA  and  the Code, and the terms of any applicable
collective bargaining agreements,  except for such instances of noncompliance
with either plan terms or Laws that,  individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be  likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

(c)  Each  Company Pension Plan intended to be tax qualified under United
States Laws  is so  qualified and has been the subject of determination
letters from the 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Internal  Revenue Service with respect to all tax Law changes with respect to
which the  Internal Revenue Service is willing to provide a determination
letter, to the  effect that such Company Pension Plan is qualified and exempt
from United States  Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the  Code; no such determination letter has been revoked
(nor, to the knowledge  of  the Company, has revocation been threatened) nor
has any such Company Pension  Plan been amended since the date of its most
recent determination letter or  application therefor in any respect that
would adversely affect its  qualification or require security under Section
307 of ERISA, except for  such failures to qualify or to obtain such a
determination letter and such  revocations of determination letters and
amendments that, individually or in  the  aggregate, have not had and would
not be reasonably likely to have a Company  Material Adverse Effect. Each
Company Benefit Plan required to have been  approved by any non-U.S.
Governmental Entity (or permitted to have been approved  to obtain any
beneficial tax or other status) has been so approved; no such  approval has
been revoked (nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has revocation  been
threatened) and no event has occurred since the date of the most recent 
approval that could reasonably be expected to affect any such approval,
except  for such failures to approve, revocations of approval and events
that,  individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not be
reasonably  likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(d)  Except  for  liability that would not be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse  Effect, no liability under Title IV of ERISA or to
the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation (other than PBGC insurance
premiums) has been or is  expected to be incurred by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or Commonly  Controlled Entity with respect to any
ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer" plan (as defined in Section
4001(a)(15) of ERISA),  currently or formerly maintained by any of them. None
of the Company Pension  Plans has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as
defined in Section 302 of  ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not
waived, nor has any  waiver of the minimum funding standards of Section 302
of ERISA or  Section 412 of the Code been requested. None of the Company
Pension Plans  and related trusts has been terminated, nor has there been any
"reportable  event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) with respect to any
Company  Pension Plan, in each case during the last six years, and no notice
of a  reportable event will be required to be filed in connection with the 
Transactions, except for such terminations and reportable events that, 
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not be reasonably 
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company, any 
Company Subsidiary or any Commonly Controlled Entity has incurred, or
reasonably  expects to incur, a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial
withdrawal" (as each  such term is defined in Sections 4203 and 4205,
respectively, of ERISA)  since the effective date of such Sections 4203 and
4205 with respect to any  Company Pension Plan that is a "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of  Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA that has had or would be
reasonably likely to  have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e)  None  of  the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any employee of the
Company or any Company  Subsidiary, any of the Company Benefit Plans,
including the Company Pension  Plans and, to the knowledge of the Company,
any trusts created under any of  the  Company Benefit Plans or any trustee,
administrator or other fiduciary of any  Company Benefit Plan or trust
created thereunder and any agent of the foregoing,  has engaged in a
"prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of  ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary  responsibility that could
subject the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any  such  employee or any of
the Company Benefit Plans, or, to the knowledge of the  Company, any such
trust, trustee, administrator or other fiduciary, to the  tax  or penalty on
prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code,  the sanctions
imposed under Title I of ERISA or other substantially similar  applicable Law
or any other liability for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA  or any other
applicable Law, except for such prohibited transactions and other  breaches
of fiduciary responsibility that, individually or in the aggregate,  have not
had and would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material  Adverse
Effect.

 

 

(f)  With  respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare
benefit plan,  whether or not subject to ERISA, (i) no such Company Benefit
Plan is funded  through a "welfare benefits fund" (as defined in Section
419(e) of the  Code), (ii) each such Company Benefit Plan that is a "group
health plan" (as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) complies with the
applicable  requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code and any similar
state statute,  except for such failures to comply that, individually or in
the aggregate,  have  not had and would not be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse  Effect, (iii) no such Company Benefit Plan provides
benefits after  termination of employment, except where the cost thereof is
borne entirely  by  the former employee (or his or her eligible dependents
or beneficiaries) or  as  required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code and (iv)
each such Company  Benefit Plan (including any such Company Benefit Plan
covering retirees or  other  former employees) may be amended or terminated
without material liability to  the  Company or any Company Subsidiary on or
at any time after the Effective  Time.

 

 

(g)  Except  pursuant to arrangements agreed in writing by Parent or its
affiliates, no  amount, economic benefit or other entitlement that could be
received (whether  in  cash or property or the vesting of property) as a
result of any of the  Transactions (alone or in combination with any other
event) by any person who  is  a "disqualified individual" (as defined in
Treasury Regulation  Section 1.280G-1) with respect to the Company ("
_Potential  Parachute Payment_ ")  would  be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as defined in  Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), and no
such disqualified individual is  entitled to receive any additional payment
from the Company, the Surviving  Corporation or any other person in the event
that the excise tax required by  Section 4999(a) of the Code is imposed on
such disqualified  individual.

 

 

(h)  Except  pursuant to (i) arrangements agreed in writing by Parent or
its affiliates  and (ii) the accelerated vesting of Company Stock Options
held by any 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Participant,  no Participant will be entitled to (A)(1) any severance,
separation, change  of control, termination, bonus or other additional
compensation or benefits,  or  (2) any acceleration of the time of payment
or vesting of any compensation  or benefits or any forgiveness of
indebtedness owed by such Participant, in  each  case as a result of any of
the Transactions (alone or in combination with any  other event) or in
connection with the termination of such Participant's  employment on or after
the Effective Time or (B) any compensation or  benefits related to or
contingent upon, or the value of which will be calculated  on the basis of,
any of the Transactions (alone or in combination with any  other  event).
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of  the 
Transactions (alone or in combination with any other event) and compliance 
by  the Company with the provisions hereof do not and will not require the
funding  (whether through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any Company
Benefit Plan,  Company Benefit Agreement or any other employment arrangement
and will not  limit  the Company's ability to amend, modify or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan or  Company Benefit Agreement.

 

 

(i)  Since  January 1, 2003, and through the date of this Agreement,
neither the  Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received notice of, and,
to the knowledge  of the Company, there are no (i) pending termination
proceedings or other  suits, claims (except claims for benefits payable in
the normal operation of  the  Company Benefit Plans), actions or proceedings
against, or involving or  asserting any rights or claims to benefits under,
any Company Benefit Plan  or  Company Benefit Agreement or (ii) pending
investigations (other than  routine inquiries) by any Governmental Entity
with respect to any Company  Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement,

obligations,  including under or on account of a Company Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit  Agreement, arising out of the hiring of persons to provide
services to the  Company or any Company Subsidiary and treating such persons
as consultants  or  independent contractors and not as employees of the
Company or any Company  Subsidiary, except for any such liability and
obligations that, individually  or  in the aggregate, have not had and would
not be reasonably likely to have a  Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(k)  None  of  the employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
member of,  represented by or otherwise subject to any (i) labor union, works
council  or similar organization or (ii) collective bargaining agreement, 
industry-wide collective bargaining agreement or any similar collective 
agreement, in each case with respect to such employee's employment by the 
Company or any Company Subsidiary, and the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries  do not have any obligation (including to inform or consult with

(c)  _Periodic  Reports._   In  connection with the continuing operation
of the business of the Company and  the  Company Subsidiaries between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time  and to the extent permitted by
Antitrust Laws (as defined in Section 6.03(c)),  the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to report in good faith  on  a regular basis
to the representatives of Parent regarding material operational  developments
and the general status of ongoing operations pursuant to procedures 
reasonably requested in writing by Parent or its representatives; _provided_
  that the  consultation required by this Section 5.01(d) shall be conducted
in a manner  so  as not to disrupt in any material respect the business of
the Company and the  Company Subsidiaries; _provided_   further  that the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not report to Parent or  its 
representatives any non-public information related to output, pricing or any 
other competitively-sensitive matter. Parent and Sub acknowledge that
neither  Parent nor Sub shall have any approval rights under this Section
5.01(d). The  Company acknowledges that any such reports shall not constitute
a waiver by  either Parent or Sub of any rights it may have under this
Agreement and that  neither Parent nor Sub shall have any liability or
responsibility for any  actions of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
of their respective  directors or officers with respect to matters that are
the subject of such  reports. All information exchanged pursuant to this
Section 5.01(c) shall be  subject to the Confidentiality Agreement (as

not be required to provide any information  pursuant to this Section 5.01(c)
to the extent such information is not required  to be provided pursuant to
Section 6.02.

 

 

SECTION  5.02. _No  Solicitation._ (a)  The  Company shall not, nor shall
it authorize or permit any Company Subsidiary  to,  nor shall it authorize
or permit any officer, director or employee of, or any  investment banker,
attorney or other advisor or representative (each, a " _Representative_
" and  collectively, " _Representatives_ ")  of, the  Company or any
Company Subsidiary to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit,  initiate or
encourage the submission of, any Company Takeover Proposal (as  defined in
Section 5.02(e)), (ii) enter into any agreement with  respect to any Company
Takeover Proposal or (iii) directly or indirectly  participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any  person any
information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate  any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably 
be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that,  during the period prior to the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company and  its  Representatives may, to the extent required
by the fiduciary obligations of  the  Company Board, as determined in good
faith by a majority of the members thereof  after consultation with outside
counsel, in response to a Superior Company  Proposal (as defined in Section
5.02(e)) or a Company Takeover Proposal  from a person that the Company Board
determines, in good faith following  consultation with outside counsel, is
reasonably capable of making a Superior  Company Proposal that, in each case,
was not solicited by the Company after  December 21, 2005, and that did not
otherwise result from a breach or a  deemed breach of this Section 5.02(a),
and subject to compliance with  Section 5.02(c), (x) furnish information with
respect to the Company  to the person

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 


 

making  such Superior Company Proposal or Company Takeover Proposal and its 
Representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement not less restrictive 
of  the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section
6.02)  and (y) participate in discussions and/or negotiations with such
person and  its Representatives regarding any such Superior Company Proposal
or Company  Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed
that any  violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence
by any  Representative or affiliate of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
shall  be  deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by the Company.
Other than as  permitted by the proviso to the first sentence of this 
Section 5.02(a),  the  Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, cease immediately all  discussions and negotiations regarding any
proposal that constitutes, or may  reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Company Takeover Proposal.

 

 

(b)  The  Company promptly shall advise Parent orally and in writing of any
Company  Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that could
reasonably be  expected to lead to any Company Takeover Proposal and the
identity of the person  making any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry
including any change to  the  material details of any such Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry. The Company  shall (i) keep Parent fully informed of the
status including any change to  the  material details of any such Company
Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii)  provide to Parent as soon as
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof  with  copies of all material
correspondence and other written material sent or  provided to the Company
from any third party in connection with any Company  Takeover Proposal or
sent or provided by the Company to any third party in  connection with any
Company Takeover Proposal.

 

 

(c)  Nothing  contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the Company
from taking and  disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or  14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
required disclosure  to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company  Board, after consultation with outside counsel,
failure so to disclose would  be  inconsistent with its obligations under
applicable Law.

 

 

(d)  For  purposes of this Agreement:

 

 

" _Company  Takeover Proposal_ " means  (i) any proposal or offer for a
merger, consolidation, dissolution,  recapitalization or other business
combination involving the Company,  (ii) any proposal for the issuance by the
Company of over 20% of its equity  securities as consideration for the assets
or securities of another person  or  (iii) any proposal or offer to acquire
in any manner, directly or  indirectly, over 20% of the equity securities or
consolidated total assets  of  the Company, in each case other than the
Transactions. For the avoidance of  doubt, the TM Distribution and all
proposals related thereto shall not be deemed  to be a Company Takeover
Proposal.

" _Superior  Company Proposal_ " means  any proposal made by a third party
to acquire 50% or more of the equity  securities or consolidated assets of
the Company, pursuant to a tender or  exchange offer, a merger, a
consolidation, a liquidation or dissolution, a  recapitalization, a sale of
its assets or otherwise, (i) on terms which a  majority of the members of the
Company Board determines in good faith to be  more  favorable to the holders
of Company Common Stock than the Merger, taking into  account all the terms
and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement and  (ii) that is
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all  financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal; _provided_   that the 
Company Board shall not so determine that any such proposal is a Superior 
Company Proposal until the Company has complied in all material respects
with  Section 5.02(b) with respect to such proposal. For the avoidance of
doubt,  the  TM Distribution and all proposals related thereto shall not be
deemed to be  a  Superior Company Proposal.

_Additional  Agreements_

 

 

SECTION  6.01. _Preparation  of Information Statement; Action by Written
Consent._ (a)  The  Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date
of this Agreement,  prepare and file with the SEC the Information Statement
(including all  information required by Rule 13e-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) in  preliminary form, and each of the Company and Parent shall
use its commercially  reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments of  the  SEC with respect thereto. The Company
shall notify Parent promptly of the  receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff and of any request by the  SEC  or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Information Statement or  on  any other Company
Disclosure Document or for additional information and shall  supply Parent
with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any  of  its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other 
hand, with respect to the Information Statement or any other Company
Disclosure  Document. If at any time prior to the Effective Time there shall
occur any  event  that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Information  Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to
its stockholders  such  an amendment or supplement. The Company shall not
mail any Information  Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, to
which Parent reasonably  objects. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause  the  Information Statement to be mailed to the
Company's stockholders as promptly as  practicable after filing with the SEC.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior  to  filing or mailing the Information
Statement or any other Company Disclosure  Document (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments  of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an  opportunity to review and
comment on such

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 


 

document  or response and (ii) shall include in such document or response all
reasonable  comments proposed by Parent.

 

 

(b)  Parent  shall, promptly following the date of this Agreement, seek the
Company  Stockholder Approval by the written consent of the holders of a
majority of  the  outstanding Company Common Stock. The Company shall,
through the Company Board,  recommend to its stockholders that they give the
Company Stockholder Approval,  except to the extent that the Company Board
shall have withdrawn or modified  its  approval or recommendation of this
Agreement or the Merger after the Company  Board shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with outside  counsel, that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its obligations  under applicable Law.

 

 

SECTION  6.02. _Access  to Information; Confidentiality._   Each of  the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of their subsidiaries to, 
afford to the other party, and to the other party's officers, employees, 
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives,
affiliates  and sources and potential sources of financing (and
representatives of each  of  the foregoing), reasonable access during normal
business hours during the period  prior to the Effective Time (as long as
such access is not unreasonably  disruptive to the business of such party or
its subsidiaries) to all their  respective properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records  and,  during such period, each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each  of its subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of  each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it  during such period
pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities  laws and (b) all
other information concerning its business, properties and  personnel as the
other party may reasonably request; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  either
party may withhold (i) any document or information that is subject  to the
terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party, (ii) such  portions
of documents or information relating to output, pricing or other  matters
that are highly sensitive if the exchange of such documents (or portions 
thereof) or information, as determined by such party's counsel, would
reasonably  be expected to raise antitrust concerns for such party (or any of
its  affiliates) or (iii) such portions of documents or information that
would  reasonably be expected to jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or
contravene  any Law or fiduciary duty (provided that each party shall in good
faith seek  and  implement a reasonable alternative to provide the other
party's counsel with  access to such document or information). All
information exchanged pursuant  to  this Section 6.02 shall be subject to
the confidentiality agreement dated  September 29, 2005, between the Company
and RHJI (the " _Confidentiality  Agreement_ ").

 

 

SECTION  6.03. _Commercially  Reasonable Efforts; Notification._ (a) 
Upon  the  terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the  parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to  be  taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate  with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable  to  consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable,  the  Merger and the other Transactions,

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 


 

including  (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents  and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary  registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities, if  any)  and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval  or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity,  (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from  third parties, (iii) the defending of
any lawsuits or other legal  proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement  or  any other Transaction Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions,  including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by  any  court or other Governmental
Entity vacated or reversed and (iv) the  execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate  the  Transactions and to
fully carry out the purposes of the Transaction Agreements.  Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge  that it is
the intention of each of the parties hereto that the TM Distribution 
(including obtaining all necessary third party consents and approvals with 
respect thereto, including as required under any securities laws) shall
become  payable immediately following the Effective Time to Company common
stockholders  of record one business day prior to the Closing Date and each
party hereto  shall  use its commercially reasonable efforts to achieve the
same. In connection  with  and without limiting the foregoing, the Company
and the Company Board shall  (i)  take all action necessary to ensure that
the TM Distribution is paid on terms  and conditions consistent with the TM
Distribution Conditions and the terms  set  forth in Exhibit B, (ii) take
all action necessary to ensure that no state  takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable  to  any Transaction or this
Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, and  (iii) if any state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation  becomes applicable to this
Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, take  all action necessary to
ensure that the Merger and the other Transactions may  be  consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this  Agreement and the
Transaction Agreements and otherwise to minimize the effect  of  such
statute or regulation on the Merger and the other Transactions. Nothing  in 
this Agreement shall be deemed to require any party to waive any substantial 
rights or agree to any substantial limitation on its operations or to
dispose  of  any significant asset or collection of assets. Notwithstanding
the foregoing,  the Company and its Representatives shall not be prohibited
under this  Section 6.03(a) from taking any action permitted by Section
5.02(b).  Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information,
the Company  and Parent and their respective counsel shall have the right to
review in  advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult the
other on, any  filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Entity  in  connection with the Merger and the other
Transactions. The Company and Parent  shall provide the other party and its
counsel with the opportunity to  participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any  filing, investigation or other inquiry
in connection with the Merger or the  other Transactions.

 

 

(b)  The  Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or
Acquisition Sub shall  give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any
representation or 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 


 

warranty  made by it contained in this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement
that is  qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any
respect or  any  such representation or warranty that is not so qualified
becoming untrue or  inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by
it to comply with  or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition
or agreement to  be  complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  such notification shall be deemed to be
a waiver or cure of any such breach  or  failure to comply or affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or  agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties  under this Agreement or the
Transaction Agreements.

 

 

(c)  Nothing  in  Section 6.03(a) shall require Parent to dispose of any
of its assets or to  limit its freedom of action with respect to any of its
businesses, or to consent  to any disposition of the Company's assets or
limits on the Company's freedom of  action with respect to any of its
businesses, or to commit or agree to any  of  the foregoing, and nothing in
Section 6.03(a) shall authorize the Company  to commit or agree to any of the
foregoing, to obtain any consents, approvals,  permits or authorizations to
remove any impediments to the Merger relating  to  the HSR Act, the Japanese
Anti-Monopoly law or other antitrust, competition  or  premerger
notification, trade regulation law, regulation or order (" _Antitrust  Laws_
")  or to  avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary  restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding relating to Antitrust  Laws.

 

 

(d)  Nothing  in  this Section 6.03 shall require Parent to (i) consent to
any action or  omission by the Company that would be inconsistent with
Section 5.01 absent  such consent or (ii) agree to amend or waive any
provision of this  Agreement.

 

 

(e)  As  soon as  reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, Parent, in  its  capacity as the sole stockholder of Sub, shall
adopt this  Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  6.04. _Stock  Options and Restricted Stock Units._ (a)  As  soon
as  practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or,
if  appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plan) shall
adopt  such resolutions or take such other actions as are required to adjust
the terms  of each outstanding Company Stock Option, whether vested or
unvested, to provide  that each such Company Stock Option shall be rolled
over at the Effective Time  by canceling such Company Stock Option in
exchange for a cash payment by the  Company of an amount equal to (A) the
excess, if any, of (1) the Common  Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise
price per share of Company  Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
(adjusted to reflect the  TM  Distribution), multiplied by (B) the number of
shares of Company Common  Stock that are subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the  Effective Time and for which such Company Stock
Option shall not theretofore  have been exercised. Parent will make available
options on its common stock  to  employees of the Company set forth on
Section 6.04(a) of the Parent Disclosure 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Letter  (as  it may be supplemented by Parent prior to the Effective Time),
on the terms  and  conditions provided therein.

 

 

(b)  As  soon as  practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company Board (or, if  appropriate, any committee administering the Company
Stock Plan) shall adopt  such resolutions or take such other actions as are
required to adjust the terms  of all outstanding Company RSUs heretofore
granted under the Company Stock  Plan,  whether vested or unvested, to
provide that each such Company RSU shall be  canceled at the Effective Time
in exchange for a cash payment by the Company  of  an amount equal to (i)
(A) if the holder of such Company RSU is a Principal  Company Stockholder,
$2.40 or (B) if the holder of such Company RSU is not  a  Principal Company
Stockholder, the Common Merger Consideration multiplied by  (ii) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that are subject to such  Company RSU for
which such Company RSU shall not theretofore have been  settled.

 

 

(c)  All  amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be subject to

Agreement  as  having been paid to the applicable holders) and shall be paid
without  interest.

transfer or grant  of any capital stock of the Company or any interest in
respect of any capital  stock of the Company shall be deleted as of the
Effective Time, and the Company  shall ensure that following the Effective
Time no holder of a Company Stock  Option or Company RSU or any Participant
shall have any right thereunder to  acquire any capital stock of the Company
or the Surviving Corporation or any  other equity interest therein.

 

 

(e)  In  this  Agreement:

 

 

" _Company  Stock Option_ " means  any option to purchase Company Common

SECTION  6.05. _Benefit  Plans._ (a)  For  one  year following the
Effective Time, Parent either (i) shall  maintain or cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain the Company Benefit  Plans (other than plans
providing for the issuance of Company Common Stock  or  based on the value
of Company Common Stock) at the benefit levels in effect  on  the date of
this Agreement or (ii) shall provide or cause the Surviving  Corporation to
provide benefits (other than benefits under plans providing  for  the
issuance of Company Capital Stock or based on the value of Company Capital 
Stock) to

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 


 

employees  of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that, taken as a
whole, are not  materially less favorable in the aggregate to such employees
than those provided  to such employees as of the date of this Agreement.
Nothing herein shall be  construed to prohibit Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from amending or  terminating such Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms and with  applicable Law, so long as Parent is in
compliance with the other terms of  this  Section 6.05(a).

 

 

(b)  The  service of each employee of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries prior  to  the Effective Time shall be treated as service with
Parent or any of its  subsidiaries for purposes of each employee benefit plan
of Parent or any of  its  subsidiaries in which such employee is eligible to
participate after the  Effective Time, including for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, benefit levels  and accruals (but not for purposes of benefit
accrual under any defined benefit  pension plans); _provided_ ,  _however_
,  that  such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would  result in any duplication of benefits.

 

 

(c)  Parent  shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitation under  any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
affiliates (other  than the Company and Company Subsidiaries) in which
employees of the Company  and  the Company Subsidiaries (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to  participate from and after the Effective
Time, except to the extent that such  pre-existing condition limitation would
have been applicable under the  comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Parent  shall recognize, or cause to be
recognized, the dollar amount of all expenses  incurred by each employee of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (and  his  or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective  Time  occurs
for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment  limitations
under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be  eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time.

 

 

(d)  The  provisions of this Section 6.05 are not intended to confer upon
any person  other than the parties any rights or remedies.

 

 

SECTION  6.06. _Indemnification._ (a)  Parent  shall cause to be
maintained for a period of not less than six years from the  Effective Time
the Company's current directors' and officers' insurance and  indemnification
policy to the extent that it provides coverage for events  occurring prior to
the Effective Time (the " _D andO  Insurance_")  for all  persons who are
directors and officers of the Company on the date of this  Agreement, so long
as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of  150%  of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (such 150%  amount,
the " _Maximum  Premium_ ").  If the  existing DandO Insurance expires, is
terminated or canceled during such  six-year period, Parent shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause  to be obtained as much DandO
Insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of  such period for an
annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium,  on  terms and
conditions no less advantageous than the existing

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 


 

DandO  Insurance. In lieu of continuing the existing DandO Insurance, (i)
Parent  may obtain after the Effective Time a "tail" DandO Insurance policy on
terms  and conditions no less advantageous than the existing DandO Insurance
for a  period of six years from the Effective Time; _provided_   that the 
annualized premium shall not exceed the Maximum Premium and (ii) the  Company
may obtain prior to the Effective Time a "tail" DandO Insurance policy  in an
amount and on terms and conditions no more advantageous than the existing 
DandO Insurance for a period of six years from the Effective Time;  _provided_
  that the  lump sum premium shall not exceed $962,000. The Company
represents to Parent  that the Maximum Premium is $650,000.

 

 

(b)  Parent  shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, cause the
Surviving Corporation  to honor all the Company's obligations to indemnify or
hold harmless (including  any obligations to advance funds for expenses) the
current or former directors  or officers of the Company for acts or omissions
by such directors and officers  occurring prior to the Effective Time to the
extent that such obligations of  the  Company exist on the date of this
Agreement, whether pursuant to the Company  Charter, the Company By-laws,
individual indemnity agreements or otherwise,  and  such obligations shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force  and  effect in
accordance with the terms of the Company Charter, the Company By-laws  and
such individual indemnity agreements from the Effective Time until the 
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any
claims  against such directors or officers arising out of such acts or
omissions. Parent  shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, cause the
Surviving Corporation  to advance funds for expenses incurred by a director
or officer in defending  a  civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding
relating to the indemnification  obligations referenced in the immediately
preceding sentence in advance of  the  final disposition of such action,
suit or proceeding upon receipt of an  undertaking by or on behalf of such

other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity  to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with  respect to

release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,  except

SECTION  6.09. _Transfer  Taxes._   All stock  transfer, real estate
transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and other similar  Taxes (including
interest, penalties and additions to any such Taxes)  (" _Transfer  Taxes_
")  incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid by either

cooperate with  Acquisition Sub and Parent in preparing, executing and filing
any Tax Returns  with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

 

 

SECTION  6.10. _Stockholder  Litigation._   The  Company shall give

withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

 

SECTION  6.11. _Financing;  Consent Solicitations._ (a)  _Financing_. 
Parent  and Acquisition Sub shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain  the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the  Commitment Letter, Parent Consent Letter and Parent
Commitment Letter and to  obtain the funds contemplated by the Equity
Commitment (and to contribute such  funds to the Company), including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (A)  negotiate definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing consistent with  the terms and conditions contained
in the Commitment Letter and (B) satisfy  on a  timely basis all conditions
in such definitive agreements the satisfaction  of  which is within the
control of Parent or Acquisition Sub. Parent and Acquisition  Sub shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to comply with their  respective
obligations, and enforce their respective rights, under the  Commitment
Letter, the Parent Consent Letter and Parent Commitment Letter and  shall
cause RHJI to comply with its obligations under the Equity Commitment. 
Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in 
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to obtain the proceeds of the 
Financing and shall not permit any amendment or modification to, or any
waiver  of any material provision or remedy under, any of the Commitment
Letter, the  Parent Consent Letter, Parent Commitment Letter or the Equity
Commitment if  such  amendment, modification, waiver or remedy amends the
conditions to the drawdown  of the Financing in a manner adverse to the
interests of the Company and its  shareholders, in each case, in any material
respect or would adversely affect  in  any material respect the ability of
Parent or the Company to effect the  Financing or obtain the proceeds of the
Equity Commitment. The Company shall  also use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist and cooperate with Parent  and  Acquisition Sub in
connection with their efforts to obtain the proceeds of  the  Financing,
including providing reasonably required information relating to  the 
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the financial institution or 
institutions providing the Financing and executing and delivering, and
causing  the Company Subsidiaries to execute and deliver, customary
certificates, legal  opinions (which may be reasoned, if counsel reasonably
believes it cannot give  the opinion otherwise) or other documents and
instruments relating to  guarantees, the pledge of collateral and other
matters ancillary to the  Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent
in connection with the  Financing;

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 


 

_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  obligation of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary under any such certificate,  document or instrument shall
be effective until the Effective Time and none  of  the Company or any
Company Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment  or  other
similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the Financing 
prior to the Effective Time. In the event that the Financing is not
available  to  consummate the Refinancing and pay related fees and expenses
of the Transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, then Parent  shall promptly notify the Company and Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall use  their  commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
alternative financing on terms that  are no less favorable to Parent and
Acquisition Sub than those set forth in  the  Commitment Letter, Parent
Consent Letter or Parent Commitment Letter, as  applicable, and in the same
amounts as contemplated by the Commitment Letter  (including for working
capital purposes following the Closing) or Parent  Commitment Letter, as
applicable (the " _Alternative  Financing_ ");  _provided_   that no  such
Alternative Financing shall require a greater cash equity commitment than 
that contemplated by the Equity Commitment.

 

 

(b)  _Consent  Solicitations._   As soon  as practicable following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement the  Company shall commence the
Consent Solicitations with respect to all of its  11%  Senior Subordinated
Notes, 10% Senior Subordinated Notes and 10% Senior Notes  whereby the
Company shall (i) seek to effect a tender offer of the Tender Notes  and (ii)
solicit the consents of the holders of the Notes regarding amendments  to the
covenants contained in the respective Notes Indentures (the " _Indenture 
Amendments_ "),  in  each case contemplated by Schedule 6.11(b) hereto. In
accordance with the  terms of the Consent Solicitations, (i) assuming the
conditions to the tender  offer therein are satisfied, and in connection with
the consummation of the  Transactions, the Company will accept the tendered
Notes for payment and (ii)  assuming the requisite consents are received, the
Company shall execute  supplemental indentures to each of the Notes
Indentures among the Company,  the  guarantors named therein and the trustee
party thereto reflecting the Indenture  Amendments, which supplemental
indentures shall become operative concurrently  with the Effective Time, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts  to  cause the trustees under
the Indentures to promptly enter into such supplemental  indentures as
applicable. Parent and the Company each shall use its commercially 
reasonable efforts to proceed with and complete the Consent Solicitations as 
required to satisfy the condition precedents in Section 7.01(e) and  Section
7.02(f) and shall consult and cooperate with each other in all such  efforts;
_provided_   that  (i) Parent shall have the sole right to control decisions
with respect to  the strategy and conduct of the Consent Solicitations
(including modifying  the  terms and structure thereof as set forth on
Schedule 6.11(b) hereto) and  (ii) the consent of the Company shall be
required to modify or waive  material terms or conditions of the Consent
Solicitations if such would be  reasonably likely to materially and adversely
impact the probability of a  successful outcome for the Consent Solicitations
or would conflict with the  provisions of any Transaction Agreement and
documents delivered in connection  with the foregoing. Promptly following the
date of this Agreement, the Company  shall prepare and mail the documentation
to be sent to the holders of the Notes 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 


 

in  connection with the Consent Solicitations, but only after receipt of
approval  from Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or  conditioned). The Company shall provide, shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries  to  provide, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause their  respective Representatives to provide, all cooperation
requested by Parent  in  connection with the Consent Solicitations including
assisting in the preparation  and execution of all documents required in
connection therewith. All  documentation for the Consent Solicitations will
be customary for transactions  of this nature and shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to  Parent and the Company. The Consent
Solicitations and other actions taken in  connection therewith shall be
conducted in accordance with the terms of the  applicable Indentures and all
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and  other applicable Laws. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any  information relating to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or any of their  affiliates, officers or directors,
should be discovered by the Company, Parent  or Acquisition Sub which if not
set forth in an amendment or supplement to  the  documents mailed to Note
holders in respect of the Consent Solicitations would  reasonably be expected
to cause such documents to include any misstatement  of a  material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the  statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made,  not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify  the other
parties hereto and, to the extent required by law, rules or  regulations, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information  shall
promptly by prepared and, if required, filed with the SEC and/or 
disseminated to the holders of Notes.

Sections 3.01, 3.03, 3.04 and 3.18(a)) shall be true and  correct, as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though  made on the
Closing Date, except to the extent such representations and  warranties
expressly relate to an earlier date (in which case such  representations and

whether such representations and warranties shall be  true and correct and
applying the foregoing Company Material Adverse Effect  qualifier, all such
representations and warranties that already are qualified  by  reference to
a Company Material Adverse Effect or other materiality qualifier  shall be
deemed to be not so qualified). The representations and warranties  of  the
Company set

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49

(b) by  either  Parent or the Company:

 

 

(i) if  the  Merger is not consummated on or before March 1, 2007 (the "
_Outside  Date_ "),  unless  the failure to consummate the Merger is the
result of a willful and material  breach of this Agreement by the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that the 
passage of such period shall be tolled for any part thereof during which any 
party shall be subject to a nonfinal order, decree, ruling or action 
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the 
Merger;

 

 

(ii) if  any  Governmental Entity issues an order, decree or ruling or takes
any other action  permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting
the Merger and  such  order, decree, ruling or other action shall have
become final and nonappealable; 

 

 

(iii) if  the  Company Stockholder Approval is not validly obtained on or
prior to  September 7, 2006; or

 

 

(iv) if  the  Parent Stock Purchase Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its  terms;

 

 

(c) by  Parent,  if the Company breaches or fails to perform in any material
respect any of  its  representations, warranties or covenants contained in
any Transaction Agreement,  which breach or failure to perform (i) would give
rise to the failure of a  condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) or 7.02(b),
and (ii) cannot be  or has not been cured by the Outside Date (provided that
Parent is not then  in  willful and material breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant  contained in this Agreement);

 

 

(d) by  the  Company prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval in accordance  with Section 8.05(b); _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that the  Company shall have complied with all provisions thereof, including
the notice  provisions therein; or

 

 

(e) by  the  Company, if Parent or Acquisition Sub breaches or fails to
perform in any  material respect any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained  in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
(i) would give rise to  the  failure of a condition set forth in Section
7.03(a) or 7.03(b), and (ii) cannot  be or has not been cured by the Outside

52  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

SECTION  8.02. _Effect  of Termination._   In the  event of termination
of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as  provided in Section
8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and  have no effect, without
any liability or obligation on the part of Parent,  Acquisition Sub or the
Company, other than Section 3.20, Section 4.06,  the last sentence of Section
6.02, Section 6.07, this  Section 8.02 and Article IX, which provisions shall
survive such  termination, and except to the extent that such termination
results from the  willful and material breach by a party of any
representation, warranty or  covenant set forth in this Agreement, in which
case the aggrieved party shall  be  entitled to all remedies available at
law or in equity.

 

 

SECTION  8.03. _Amendment._   This  Agreement may be amended by the
parties at any time before or after receipt  of  the Company Stockholder

Agreement after the Effective Time. This  Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf  of each of the parties.

agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Subject to the  proviso
in Section 8.03, no extension or waiver by the Company shall  require the
approval of the stockholders of the Company. Any agreement on the  part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set  forth  in
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of 
any  party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement
or  otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 

 

SECTION  8.05. _Procedure  for Termination, Amendment, Extension or
Waiver._ (a)  A  termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an
amendment of  this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or

determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that it 
is  necessary for the Company Board to withdraw or modify its approval or 
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger in

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 


 

order  to  comply with its fiduciary duty under applicable Law, (iii) the
Company has  notified Parent in writing of the determinations described in
clause (ii)  above and has given Parent an opportunity to submit a revised
proposal, (iv)  at  least five business days following receipt by Parent of

Company Proposal and a majority  of  the directors of the Company has again
made the determinations referred to  in  clause (ii) above, (v) the Company
is in compliance with  Section 5.02, (vi) the Company has concurrently with
