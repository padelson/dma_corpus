and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any Proceeding, in addition to any other remedy to which such Person may be entitled. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party

be necessary to allow such Limited Partner to participate in a transaction described in the following sentence, in each case with respect to a number of Class A Common Units at least equal to or exceeding the Minimum Exchange Amount, by delivering
an Exchange Notice to the Partnership, with a copy to the Special Limited Partner. An Exchange Notice may specify that the Exchange is to be contingent (including as to timing) upon the consummation of a purchase by another Person (whether in a
tender or exchange offer, an underwritten offering or otherwise) of the Class A Shares into which the Class A Common Units are exchangeable, or contingent (including as to timing) upon the closing of an announced merger, consolidation or other

Realized Tax Detriment) for each Taxable Year is intended to measure the decrease (or increase) in the actual liability for Covered Taxes of the Corporate Taxpayer and its Covered Subsidiaries for such Taxable Year attributable to the Tax
Attributes, determined using a "with and without" methodology. Carryovers or carrybacks of any Tax item attributable to any of the Tax Attributes shall be considered to be subject to the rules of the Code and the Treasury Regulations or the
appropriate provisions of United States state and local and foreign income and franchise Tax law, as applicable, governing the use, limitation and expiration of carryovers or carrybacks of the relevant type. If a carryover or carryback of any Tax
item includes a portion that is attributable to any Tax Attribute ("<font style="font: bold 16px 'Times New Roman';text-decoration: underline;line-height: 19px;">TRA Portion</font>") and another portion that is not ("<font
style="font: bold 16px 'Times New Roman';text-decoration: underline;line-height: 19px;">Non-TRA Portion</font>"), such portions shall be considered to be used in accordance with the "with and without" methodology so that the amount of any Non-TRA
Portion is deemed utilized, to the extent available, prior to the amount of any TRA Portion, to the extent available (with the TRA Portion being applied on a proportionate basis consistent with the provisions of Section 3.3). The parties agree that
(A) (i) the payments made pursuant to this TRA Agreement in respect of the Purchase and Post-Closing Purchase (to the extent permitted by applicable law and other than amounts accounted for as Imputed Interest) are intended to be treated and shall
be reported for all purposes, including Tax purposes, as additional contingent consideration to the applicable TRA Parties for the sale of Partnership Units at and after the Closing that has the effect of creating additional Purchase Basis
Adjustments and (ii) the payments made pursuant to this TRA Agreement in respect of an Exchange are intended to be treated and shall be reported for all purposes, including Tax purposes, as additional contingent consideration to the applicable
Exchanging Partner for such Exchange that has the effect of creating additional Exchange Basis Adjustments, in each case, to the Reference Assets in the Taxable Year of payment, (B) such additional Purchase Basis Adjustments and Exchange Basis
Adjustments shall be incorporated into the calculation for the Taxable Year of the applicable payment and into the calculations for subsequent Taxable Years, as appropriate and (C) the Actual Tax Liability shall take into account the deduction of
the portion of the Tax Benefit Payment that must be accounted for as Imputed Interest under applicable law; <font style="font: 16px/19px 'Times New Roman';text-decoration: underline;">provided</font>, <font
style="font: 16px/19px 'Times New Roman';text-decoration: underline;">however</font>, that such liability for Covered Taxes and such taxable income shall be included in the Hypothetical Tax Liability and the Actual Tax Liability subject to the

applicable Schedule under this TRA Agreement, including any Amended Schedule delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(b), and any Early Termination Schedule or amended Early Termination Schedule, the Corporate Taxpayer shall also (x) deliver to such TRA
Party supporting schedules and work papers, as determined by the Corporate Taxpayer or as reasonably requested by such TRA Party, providing reasonable detail regarding data and calculations that were relevant for purposes of preparing the Schedule,
(y) indicate which Advisory Firm prepared the Schedule and will cause such Advisory Firm to prepare an Advisory Firm Letter with respect to such Schedule, and (z) allow the TRA Party Representative and its advisors reasonable access to the
appropriate representatives at the Corporate Taxpayer and (at the cost and expense of OpCo) at the Advisory Firm that prepared the applicable Schedule in connection with a review of such Schedule. Without limiting the generality of the preceding
sentence, the Corporate Taxpayer shall ensure that any Tax Benefit Schedule or Early Termination Schedule that is delivered to a TRA Party, along with any supporting schedules and work papers, provides a reasonably detailed presentation of the
calculation of the Actual Tax Liability (the "with" calculation) and the Hypothetical Tax Liability (the "without" calculation) and identifies any material assumptions or operating procedures or principles that were used for purposes of such
calculations. An applicable Schedule or amendment thereto shall become final and binding on all parties thirty (30) calendar days from the date on which all relevant TRA Parties have received the applicable Schedule or amendment thereto under
Section 7.1 unless the TRA Party Representative (i) prior to such date, gives the Corporate Taxpayer written notice of a material objection to such Schedule or amendment thereto made in good faith ("<font
style="font: bold 16px 'Times New Roman';text-decoration: underline;line-height: 19px;">Objection Notice</font>"), or (ii) provides a written waiver of its right to give an Objection Notice within the period described in clause (i) above, in which
case such Schedule or amendment thereto becomes binding on the date such waiver is given by the TRA Party Representative. If the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative, for any reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues
raised in any Objection Notice within thirty (30) calendar days after the TRA Party Representative gives the Corporate Taxpayer such Objection Notice, the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative shall employ the reconciliation procedures

Determination affecting such Schedule, (ii) to correct material inaccuracies in the Schedule, including those identified as a result of the receipt of additional factual information relating to a Taxable Year after the date the Schedule was provided
to a TRA Party, (iii) to comply with an Expert's determination under the Reconciliation Procedures, (iv) to reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit or the Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to a carryback or carryforward
of a loss or other Tax item to such Taxable Year, (v) to reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit or the Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to an amended Tax Return filed for such Taxable Year or (vi) to adjust an

calendar days or, in each case, as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, in each case after the matter has been submitted to the Expert for resolution. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the matter is not resolved before any payment
that is the subject of a disagreement would be due (in the absence of such disagreement) or any Tax Return reflecting the subject of a disagreement is due, the undisputed amount shall be paid on the date prescribed by this TRA Agreement and such Tax
Return may be filed as prepared by the Corporate Taxpayer, subject to adjustment or amendment upon resolution. The sum of (a) the costs and expenses relating to (i) the engagement (and, if applicable, selection by the ICC) of such Expert and (ii) if

(as finally determined by the Expert) bears to the total amount of such disputed items so submitted, and each such party shall promptly reimburse the other party for the excess that such other party has paid in respect of such costs and expenses
over the amount it has been so allocated. The Corporate Taxpayer may withhold payments under this TRA Agreement to collect amounts due under the preceding sentence. Any dispute as to whether a dispute is a Reconciliation Dispute within the meaning
of this Section 7.9 shall be decided by the Expert. The Expert shall finally determine any Reconciliation Dispute and the determinations of the Expert pursuant to this Section 7.9 shall be binding on the Corporate Taxpayer and each of the TRA

Taxpayer or its Covered Subsidiaries would be determined by recovering the actual Tax basis of the Reference Asset that reflects any Basis Adjustments. For purposes of this Section 7.11, a transfer of a partnership interest shall be treated as a
transfer of the transferring partner's share of each of the assets and liabilities of that partnership.</p> <p style="padding-left: 48px;margin-top: 28px;margin-bottom: 0px;font: bold 16px/19px 'Times New Roman';"><font
